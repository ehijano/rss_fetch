      <title>Curved commutators in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the $L^p$ boundedness theory of commutators of Hilbert transforms along monomial curves by providing the previously missing lower bounds. This optimal result now covers all monomial curves while previous results had significant geometric restrictions. We also, for the first time, develop the corresponding necessity theory for curves with non-vanishing torsion.</description>

      <title>Convergence of ADAM for Lipschitz Objective Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove the exponential convergence, local
  and global, of Adam algorithm under precise conditions on the
  parameters, when the objective function lacks
  differentiability. More precisely, we require Lipschitz continuity,
  and control on the gradient whenever it exists. We provide also
  examples of interesting functions that satisfies the required
  restrictions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there exists a constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ with the following property: if $K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a compact set which contains no pair of the form $\{x, x + (z, z^{2})\}$ for $z \neq 0$, then $\mathrm{dim}_\mathrm{H} K \leq 2 - \varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Strichartz inequalities: some recent developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strichartz inequalities, originating from Fourier restriction theory, play a central role in the analysis of dispersive partial differential equations. They serve as a cornerstone for many subsequent developments. We survey some of them in memory of Strichartz, highlighting connections to recent developments in Fourier decoupling.</description>

      <title>Exponential bases for parallelepipeds with frequencies lying in a prescribed lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a Fourier basis with frequencies in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for the space of square integrable functions supported on a given parallelepiped in $\mathbb{R}^d$, has been well understood since the 1950s. In a companion paper, we derived necessary and sufficient conditions for a parallelepiped in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to permit an orthogonal basis of exponentials with frequencies constrained to be a subset of a prescribed lattice in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a restriction relevant in many applications. In this paper, we investigate analogous conditions for parallelepipeds that permit a Riesz basis of exponentials with the same constraints on the frequencies. We provide a sufficient condition on the parallelepiped for the Riesz basis case which directly extends one of the necessary and sufficient conditions obtained in the orthogonal basis case. We also provide a sufficient condition which constrains the spectral norm of the matrix generating the parallelepiped, instead of constraining the structure of the matrix.</description>

      <title>An equivalent formulation of Sonine condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sonine kernel is characterized by the Sonine condition (denoted by SC) and is an important class of kernels in nonlocal differential equations and integral equations. This work proposes a SC with a more general form (denoted by gSC), which is more convenient than SC to accommodate complex kernels and equations. A typical kernel is given, and the first-kind Volterra integral equation under gSC is accordingly transformed and then analyzed. Based on these results, it is finally proved that the gSC is indeed equivalent to the original SC, which indicates that the Sonine kernel may be essentially characterized by the behavior of its convolution with the associated kernel at the starting point.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of infinitely generated attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.15133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dimension theory of limit sets of iterated function systems consisting of a countably infinite number of contractions. Our primary focus is on the intermediate dimensions: a family of dimensions depending on a parameter $\theta \in [0,1]$ which interpolate between the Hausdorff and box dimensions. Our main results are in the case when all the contractions are conformal. Under a natural separation condition we prove that the intermediate dimensions of the limit set are the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and the intermediate dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. This builds on work of Mauldin and Urba\'nski concerning the Hausdorff and upper box dimension. We give several (often counter-intuitive) applications of our work to dimensions of projections, fractional Brownian images, and general H\"older images. These applications apply to well-studied examples such as sets of numbers which have real or complex continued fraction expansions with restricted entries.
  We also obtain several results without assuming conformality or any separation conditions. We prove general upper bounds for the Hausdorff, box and intermediate dimensions of infinitely generated attractors in terms of a topological pressure function. We also show that the limit set of a 'generic' infinite iterated function system has box and intermediate dimensions equal to the ambient spatial dimension, where 'generic' can mean either 'full measure' or 'comeagre.'</description>

      <title>Dynamic behavior for a gradient algorithm with energy and momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel gradient algorithm, AGEM, using both energy and momentum, for addressing general non-convex optimization problems. The solution properties of the AGEM algorithm, including aspects such as uniformly boundedness and convergence to critical points, are examined. The dynamic behavior is studied through a comprehensive analysis of a high-resolution ODE system. This ODE system, being nonlinear, is derived by taking the limit of the discrete scheme while preserving the momentum effect through a rescaling of the momentum parameter. The paper emphasizes the global well-posedness of the ODE system and the time-asymptotic convergence of solution trajectories. Furthermore, we establish a linear convergence rate for objective functions that adhere to the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition.</description>

      <title>Assouad type dimensions of infinitely generated self-conformal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dimension theory of limit sets of iterated function systems consisting of a countably infinite number of conformal contractions. Our focus is on the Assouad type dimensions, which give information about the local structure of sets. Under natural separation conditions, we prove a formula for the Assouad dimension and prove sharp bounds for the Assouad spectrum in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. The Assouad spectra of the family of examples which we use to show that the bounds are sharp display interesting behaviour, such as having two phase transitions. Our results apply in particular to sets of real or complex numbers which have continued fraction expansions with restricted entries, and to certain parabolic attractors.</description>
