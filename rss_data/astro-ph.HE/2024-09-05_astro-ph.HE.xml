      <title>Impact of Dark Matter and Rotation on Neutron Star Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the combined effects of dark matter (DM) and rotation on the properties of neutron stars (NSs). We employ a self-interacting dark matter model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly, within the relativistic mean-field formalism to explore its impact on both static and rotating NSs. The Hartle-Thorne approach is utilized to model rotating NSs, treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter and considering angular velocity ($\Omega$) for rotation. We investigate how DM influences the mass-shedding limit, determined using the Keplerian frequency, and analyze the variations in angular velocity at different DM interaction strengths to assess their effects on NS mass, radius, central energy density, and eccentricity. Our results indicate that while rotation increases mass and radius due to centrifugal forces, DM softens the EOS, reducing these properties, particularly at higher DM fractions. DM also reduces rotational deformation, leading to lower eccentricity compared to DM-free NSs at the same angular velocity. Additionally, we calculate the relative deviations in maximum rotational mass and canonical equatorial radius from their baseline values, finding that high DM fractions combined with low angular velocities result in significant reductions, while low DM fractions with high rotational speeds lead to positive deviations, indicating greater deformation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic pressure effect on central EOS of PSR J0740+6620 in the light of dimensionless TOV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally agreed upon that the pressure inside a neutron star is isotropic. However, a strong magnetic field or superfluidity suggests that the pressure anisotropy may be a more realistic model. We derived the dimensionless TOV equation for anisotropic neutron stars based on two popular models, namely the BL model and the H model, to investigate the effect of anisotropy. Similar to the isotropic case, the maximum mass $M_{max}$ and its corresponding radius $R_{Mmax}$ can also be expressed linearly by a combination of radial central pressure $p_{rc}$ and central energy density $\varepsilon_{c}$, which is insensitive to the equation of state (EOS). We also found that the obtained central EOS would change with different values of $\lambda_{BL}$ ($\lambda_{H}$), which controls the magnitude of the difference between the transverse pressure and the radial pressure. Combining with observational data of PSR J0740+6620 and comparing to the extracted EOS based on isotropic neutron star, it is shown that in the BL model, for $\lambda_{BL}$ = 0.4, the extracted central energy density $\varepsilon_{c}$ changed from 546 -- 1056 MeV/fm$^{3}$ to 510 -- 1005 MeV/fm$^{3}$, and the extracted radial central pressure $p_{rc}$ changed from 87 -- 310 MeV/fm$^{3}$ to 76 -- 271 MeV/fm$^{3}$. For $\lambda_{BL}$ = 2, the extracted $\varepsilon_{c}$ and $p_{rc}$ changed to 412 -- 822 MeV/fm$^{3}$ and 50 -- 165 MeV/fm$^{3}$, respectively. In the H model, for $\lambda_{H}$ = 0.4, the extracted $\varepsilon_{c}$ changed to 626 -- 1164 MeV/fm$^{3}$, and the extracted $p_{rc}$ changed to 104 -- 409 MeV/fm$^{3}$. For $\lambda_{H}$ = 2, the extracted $\varepsilon_{c}$ decreased to 894 -- 995 MeV/fm$^{3}$, and the extracted $p_{rc}$ changed to 220 -- 301 MeV/fm$^{3}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear polarization observations of S5 0716+71 carried out by the author in 2019-2021 were continued from December 8, 2021 to March 12, 2022. These observations confirm the author's argument made in 2022 about a periodic dependence of the degree of linear polarization of S5 0716+71 on its optical flux. The harmonic period varies from 3 to 8 mJy in the 3 to 55 mJy interval.</description>

      <title>Uniform Modeling of Observed Kilonovae: Implications for Diversity and the Progenitors of Merger-Driven Long Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02158v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present uniform modeling of eight kilonovae, five following short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; including GRB170817A) and three following long GRBs. We model their broadband afterglows to determine the relative contributions of afterglow and kilonova emission. We fit the kilonovae using a three-component model in MOSFiT that accounts for ejecta geometry, and find population median ejecta masses for the total, blue ($\kappa_{B} = 0.5$ cm^2 / g), purple ($\kappa_{P} = 3$ cm^2 / g), and red ($\kappa_{R} = 10$ cm^2 / g) components of $M_{ej, tot} = 0.085_{-0.040}^{+0.110} M_{\odot}$, $M_{ej, B} = 0.006_{-0.004}^{+0.015} M_{\odot}$, $M_{ej, P} = 0.020_{-0.010}^{+0.034} M_{\odot}$, and $M_{ej, R} = 0.051_{-0.045}^{+0.100} M_{\odot}$ (68% confidence). The kilonova of GW170817 is near the median of the sample in most derived properties, while the sample indicates great diversity. We investigate trends between the ejecta masses and the isotropic-equivalent and beaming-corrected gamma-ray energies ($E_{\gamma, iso}$, $E_{\gamma}$), as well as rest-frame durations ($T_{90, rest}$). We find long GRB kilonovae have higher median red ejecta masses ($M_{ej, R} &gt; 0.05 M_{\odot}$) compared to on-axis short GRB kilonovae ($M_{ej, R} &lt; 0.02 M_{\odot}$). We also observe a weak scaling between the total and red ejecta masses with $E_{\gamma, iso}$ and $E_{\gamma}$, though a larger sample is needed to establish a significant correlation. These findings imply a connection between merger-driven long GRBs and larger tidal dynamical ejecta masses, which may indicate that their progenitors are asymmetric compact object binaries. We produce representative kilonova light curves and find that the planned depths and cadences of the Rubin and Roman Observatory surveys will be sufficient for order-of-magnitude constraints on $M_{ej, B}$ (and, for Roman, $M_{ej, P}$ and $M_{ej, R}$) of future kilonovae at $z &lt; 0.1$.</description>

      <title>Double "acct": a distinct double-peaked supernova matching pulsational pair-instability models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength data of SN2020acct, a double-peaked stripped-envelope supernova (SN) in NGC2981 at ~150 Mpc. The two peaks are temporally distinct, with maxima separated by 58 rest-frame days, and a factor of 20 reduction in flux between. The first is luminous (M$_{r}$ = -18.00 $\pm$ 0.02 mag), blue (g - r = 0.27 $\pm$ 0.03 mag), and displays spectroscopic signatures of interaction with hydrogen-free circumstellar material. The second peak is fainter (M$_{r}$ = -17.29 $\pm$ 0.03 mag), and spectroscopically similar to an evolved stripped-envelope SNe, with strong blended forbidden [Ca II] and [O II] features. No other known double-peak SN exhibits a light curve similar to that of SN 2020acct. We find the likelihood of two individual SNe occurring in the same star-forming region within that time to be highly improbable, while an implausibly fine-tuned configuration would be required to produce two SNe from a single binary system. We find that the peculiar properties of SN2020acct match models of pulsational pair instability (PPI), in which the initial peak is produced by collisions of shells of ejected material, shortly followed by a terminal explosion. Pulsations from a star with a 72 M$_{\odot}$ helium core provide an excellent match to the double-peaked light curve. The local galactic environment has a metallicity of 0.4 Z$_{\odot}$, a level where massive single stars are not expected retain enough mass to encounter the PPI. However, late binary mergers or a low-metallicity pocket may allow the required core mass. We measure the rate of SN 2020acct-like events to be $&lt;3.3\times10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at z = 0.07, or &lt;0.1% of the total core-collapse SN rate.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions years after a nearby tidal disruption event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are luminous bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies, repeating on timescales of hours to weeks. The mechanism behind these rare systems is uncertain, but most theories involve accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), undergoing instabilities or interacting with a stellar object in a close orbit. It has been suggested that this disk could be created when the SMBH disrupts a passing star, implying that many QPEs should be preceded by observable tidal disruption events (TDEs). Two known QPE sources show long-term decays in quiescent luminosity consistent with TDEs, and two observed TDEs have exhibited X-ray flares consistent with individual eruptions. TDEs and QPEs also occur preferentially in similar galaxies. However, no confirmed repeating QPEs have been associated with a spectroscopically confirmed TDE or an optical TDE observed at peak brightness. Here we report the detection of nine X-ray QPEs with a mean recurrence time of approximately 48 hours from AT2019qiz, a nearby and extensively studied optically-selected TDE. We detect and model the X-ray, ultraviolet and optical emission from the accretion disk, and show that an orbiting body colliding with this disk provides a plausible explanation for the QPEs.</description>

      <title>Radio signatures of cosmic-ray showers with deep in-ice antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as ARA and RNO-G target the radio emission these particles induce when cascading in the ice, using deep antennas in South Pole or in Greenland. One of the main backgrounds for such signals is the radio emission generated by cosmic-ray showers, either directly in the ice, or in the air and transmitted to the ice, which can both reach the deep antennas. The first detection of cosmic rays with deep antennas would thus validate this detection principle and allow us to calibrate the detectors. FAERIE, the Framework for the simulation of Air shower Emission of Radio for in-Ice Experiments, is a numerical tool that couples both CoREAS and GEANT4 Monte-Carlo codes to simulate the radio emission from cosmic-ray showers deep in the ice. Using this code, we will investigate cosmic-ray radio signatures and the possible implications on the design of a cosmic-ray veto.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRANDProto300, the mid-scale prototype of the GRAND experiment, is a planned radio array of 300 antennas over $200\, \rm km^{2}$ that will be deployed in the radio-quiet location of Xiao Dushan (China) by $\sim 2026$. The array will act as a test bench for the GRAND experiment and aim to achieve autonomous radio-detection and reconstructions of very inclined air showers in a large-scale array. GRANDProto300 will detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the energy range $10^{16.5}-10^{18}\, \rm eV$ at a rate comparable to Auger. GRANDProto300 could also contain a ground particle array that would validate the performances of the radio detectors. We discuss the current status of the detector commissioning and the rich science case made possible by GRANDProto300, which covers the study of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition, fast radio bursts and ultra-high-energy gamma-rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first assessment, using hybrid PIC simulations, of the role of non-linear Landau damping in the process of self-generated scattering in a high $\beta$ plasma, conditions appropriate for CR scattering in the halo of the Galaxy. This damping process manifests itself in the form of heating of the background plasma and reduction of the drift speed of CRs that yet remains super-Alfvenic. We also show that the damping leads to an inverse cascade process, consisting of producing non-resonant large scale modes, a novel result with many potential phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Axion-Photon Conversion Signals from Neutron Stars with Spacetime Curvature Accounted for in the Magnetosphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions are a well-motivated dark matter candidate. They may be detectable from radio line emission from their resonant conversion in neutron star magnetospheres. While radio data collection for this signal has begun, further efforts are required to solidify the theoretical predictions for the resulting radio lines. Usually, the flat spacetime Goldreich-Julian model of the neutron star magnetosphere is used, while a Schwarzschild geometry is assumed for the ray tracing. We assess the impact of incorporating the spacetime curvature into the magnetosphere model. We examine a range of neutron star and axion masses and find an average difference of $~26\%$ in radiated power compared to the standard Goldreich-Julian magnetosphere model for a $10\mu$eV mass axion and a $2.2M_\odot$ mass neutron star. A much lesser difference is found for lower-mass neutron stars, as in that case, axion-photon conversion occurs further from the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

      <title>The vela supernova remnant: The unique morphological features of jittering jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an S-shaped main-jet axis in the Vela core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) that we attribute to a pair of precessing jets, one of the tens of pairs of jets that exploded the progenitor of Vela according to the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). A main-jet axis is a symmetry axis across the CCSNR and through the center. We identify the S-shaped main-jet axis by the high abundance of ejecta elements, oxygen, neon, and magnesium. We bring the number of identified pairs of clumps and ears in Vela to seven, two pairs shaped by the pair of precessing jets that formed the main-jet axis. The pairs and the main-jet axis form the point-symmetric wind-rose structure of Vela. The other five pairs of clumps/ears do not have signatures near the center, only on two opposite sides of the CCSNR. We discuss different possible jet-less shaping mechanisms to form such a point-symmetric morphology and dismiss these processes because they cannot explain the point-symmetric morphology of Vela, the S-shaped high ejecta abundance pattern, and the enormous energy to shape the S-shaped structure. Our findings strongly support the JJEM and further severely challenge the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.</description>

      <title>SN 2021foa: Deriving a continuity between SN IIn and SN Ibn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the long-term photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of a transitioning SN~IIn/Ibn from $-$10.8 d to 150.7 d post $V$-band maximum. SN~2021foa shows prominent He i lines comparable in strength to the H$\alpha$ line around peak luminosity, placing SN~2021foa between the SN~IIn and SN~Ibn populations. The spectral comparison with SNe~IIn and SNe~Ibn shows that it resembles the SN~IIn population at pre-maximum, becomes intermediate between SNe~IIn/Ibn around maximum light, and similar to SN~1996al at late times. The photometric evolution shows a precursor at $-$50 d and a light curve shoulder around 17 d, which matches well with the light curve of the interacting IIns like SN~2016jbu. The peak luminosity and color evolution of SN 2021foa are consistent with most SNe~IIn and SNe~Ibn. SN~2021foa shows the unique case of a SN~IIn where the P-Cygni features in H$\alpha$ appear at later stages, either due to complex geometry of the CSM or an interaction of the ejecta with a CSM shell/disk (similar to SNe~2009ip and 2015bh). Temporal evolution of the H$\alpha$ profile favours a disk-like CSM geometry (CSM having both H and He) with a narrow (500 -- 1200 km s$^{-1}$) component, intermediate width (3000 -- 8000 km s$^{-1}$) and broad component in absorption. Hydrodynamical lightcurve modelling can well-reproduce the lightcurve by a two-component CSM structure with different densities ($\rho$ $\propto$ r$^{-2}$ -- $\rho$ $\propto$ r$^{-5}$), mass-loss rates (10$^{-3}$ -- 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) assuming a wind velocity of 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and having a CSM mass of 0.18 M$_{\odot}$. The overall evolution supports the fact that indicates that SN~2021foa most likely originated from a LBV star transitioning to a WR star with the mass-loss rate increasing in the period from 5 to 0.5 years before the explosion or it could be due to a binary interaction.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modelling of the exceptional GRB 221009A afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraordinary gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A provides a great opportunity to investigate the enigmatic origin and evolution of GRBs. However, the complexity of the observations associated with this GRB provides significant challenges to develop a theoretical modeling in a coherent framework. In this paper, we present a theoretical interpretation of the GRB 221009A afterglow within the relativistic fireball scenario, aiming to describe the broad-band dataset with a consistent model evolution. We find that the adiabatic fireball evolution in the slow-cooling regime provides a viable scenario in good agreement with observations. Crucial to our analysis is the set of simultaneous GeV and TeV gamma-ray data obtained by AGILE and LHAASO during the early afterglow phases. Having successfully modelled as inverse Compton emission the high-energy spectral and lightcurve properties of the afterglow up to $10^4$ s, we extend our model to later times when also optical and X-ray data are available. This approach results in a coherent physical framework that successfully describes all observed properties of the afterglow up to very late times, approximately $10^6$ s. Our model requires time-variable microphysical parameters, with a moderately increasing efficiency $\varepsilon_e$ of a few percent for transferring the shock energy to radiating particles, and a decreasing efficiency for magnetic field generation $\varepsilon_B$ in the range $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-7}$. Fitting the detailed multi-frequency spectral data across the afterglow provides a unique test of our model.</description>

      <title>Follow the Mass -- A Concordance Picture of Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three recent global simulations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have produced, using different numerical techniques and parameters, very similar pictures of their dynamics. In typical TDEs, after the star is disrupted by a supermassive black hole, the bound portion of the stellar debris follows highly eccentric trajectories, reaching apocenters of several thousand gravitational radii. Only a very small fraction is captured upon returning to the vicinity of the supermassive black hole. Nearly all the debris returns to the apocenter, where shocks produce a thick irregular cloud on this radial scale and power the optical/UV flare. These simulation results imply that over a few years, the thick cloud settles into an accretion flow responsible for the long term emission. Despite not being designed to match observations, the dynamical picture given by the three simulations aligns well with observations of typical events, correctly predicting the flares' total radiated energy, luminosity, temperature and emission line width. On the basis of these predictions, we provide an updated method ({\sc TDEmass}) to infer the stellar and black hole masses from a flare's peak luminosity and temperature. This picture also correctly predicts the luminosity observed years after the flare. In addition, we show that in a magnitude-limited survey, if the intrinsic rate of TDEs is independent of black hole mass, the detected events will preferentially have black hole masses $\sim 10^{6 \pm 0.3} M_\odot$ and stellar masses of $\sim 1-1.5 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Toward 2D Dynamo Models Calibrated by Global 3D Relativistic Accretion Disk Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional models assuming axisymmetry are an economical way to explore the long-term evolution of black hole accretion disks, but they are only realistic if the feedback of the nonaxisymmetric turbulence on the mean momentum and magnetic fields is incorporated. Dynamo terms added to the 2D induction equation should be calibrated to 3D MHD simulations. For generality, the dynamo tensors should be calibrated as functions of local variables rather than explicit functions of spatial coordinates in a particular basis. In this paper, we study the feedback of non-axisymmetric features on the 2D mean fields using a global 3D, relativistic, Cartesian simulation from the IllinoisGRMHD code. We introduce new methods for estimating overall dynamo alpha and turbulent diffusivity effects as well as measures of the dominance of non-axisymmetric components of energies and fluxes within the disk interior. We attempt closure models of the dynamo EMF using least squares fitting, considering both models where coefficient tensors are functions of space and more global, covariant models. None of these models are judged satisfactory, but we are able to draw conclusions on what sorts of generalizations are and are not promising.</description>

      <title>Diverse dark matter profiles in FIRE dwarfs: black holes, cosmic rays and the cusp-core enigma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies have historically posed challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model and, while many of the so-called 'dwarf galaxy problems' have been mitigated by incorporating baryonic processes, the observed diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves remains a contentious topic. Meanwhile, the growing observational samples of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies have prompted a paradigm shift in our understanding of dwarf galaxy evolution, traditionally thought to be regulated by stellar feedback. In this study, we explore the potential role of AGN feedback in shaping dark matter distributions and increasing the diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves, using a new suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies with the FIRE-3 model. Our findings indicate that the presence of active black holes (BHs) in dwarf galaxies can lead to diverse outcomes, ranging from cuspier to more core-like profiles. This variability arises from the dual role of BHs in providing additional feedback and regulating the extent of stellar feedback. Consistent with previous research, we find that AGN feedback is most impactful when cosmic ray (CR) modelling is included, with CRs from any source significantly influencing dark matter profiles. Overall, our results highlight that the interplay between stellar feedback, BHs, and CRs produces a broad spectrum of dark matter density profiles, which align with observed correlations between rotation curve shapes and baryonic dominance. This underscores the importance of including the full range of baryonic processes in dwarf galaxy simulations to address the persistent 'small-scale challenges' to the CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When light primordial black holes (PBHs) evaporate in the early Universe, they locally reheat the surrounding plasma, creating hot spots with temperatures that can be significantly higher than the average plasma temperature. In this work, we provide a general framework for calculating the probability that a particle interacting with the Standard Model can escape the hot spot. More specifically, we consider how these hot spots influence the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) in leptogenesis scenarios, as well as the production of dark matter (DM). For leptogenesis, we find that PBH-produced right-handed neutrinos can contribute to the BAU even if the temperature of the Universe is below the electroweak phase transition temperature, since sphaleron processes may still be active within the hot spot. For DM, particles emitted by PBHs may thermalise with the heated plasma within the hot spot, effectively preventing them from contributing to the observed relic abundance. Our work highlights the importance of including hot spots in the interplay of PBHs and early Universe observables</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dark Matter Abundance in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario to obtain the correct relic abundance for thermally under-produced dark matter. This scenario utilizes a strongly first-order phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm PT}$ that gives rise to dark matter mass $m$. Freeze-out in the broken phase can yield the desired abundance in the entire region currently allowed by observational bounds and theoretical constraints for $10^2 T_{\rm PT} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^4 T_{\rm PT}$. We show that the accompanying gravitational waves are strong enough to be detected by many upcoming and proposed experiments. This, in tandem with dark matter indirect searches, provides a multi-messenger probe of such models. Positive signals in the future can help reconstruct the potential governing the phase transition and shed light on an underlying particle physics realization.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Effect of Extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger effect has a variety of physics applications. In the context of black hole physics, it provides a channel for the decay of charged black holes. While the Schwinger rate has been derived for extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole using the $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry of the horizon, a full analysis in the whole geometry is lacking, begging the question of whether it is sufficient to ignore contributions away from the horizon. In this paper, we address this problem and obtain the spatial profile of the Schwinger production rate in an asymptotically flat RN black hole spacetime. We find that the Schwinger effect is strongest on the horizon and decays with distance from the horizon, exhibiting a characteristic scale of the Compton wavelength of the particle. The rate is switched off when the particle's charge-to-mass ratio approaches the corresponding extremality bound for black holes, in accordance with a strong form of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC).</description>

      <title>A background-estimation technique for the detection of extended gamma-ray structures with IACTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of the amount of cosmic-ray induced background events is a challenging task for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Most approaches rely on a model of the background signal derived from archival observations, which is then normalised to the region of interest (ROI) and respective observation conditions using emission-free regions in the observation.This is, however, disadvantageous for the analysis of large, extended $\gamma$-ray structures, where no sufficient source free region can be found. We aim to address this issue by estimating the normalisation of a 3-dimensional background model template from separate, matched observations of emission-free sky regions. As a result, the need for a emission-free region in the field of view of the observation becomes unnecessary. For this purpose, we implement an algorithm to identify observation pairs with as close as possible observation conditions. The open-source analysis package Gammapy is utilized for estimating the background rate, facilitating seamless adaptation of the framework to many $\gamma$-ray detection facilities. Public data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is employed to validate this methodology. The analysis demonstrates that employing a background rate estimated through this run-matching approach yields results consistent with those obtained using the standard application of the background model template. Furthermore, the compatibility of the source parameters obtained through this approach with previous publications and an analysis employing the background model template approach is confirmed, along with an estimation of the statistical and systematic uncertainties introduced by this method.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Surface Tension as the Origin for the Black Hole Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the thermodynamics of black holes using the Gouy-Stodola theorem, traditionally applied to mechanical systems relating entropy production to the difference between reversible and irreversible work. We model black holes as gravitational bubbles with surface tension defined at the event horizon, deriving the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy relation for non-rotating black holes. One extends this approach to rotating black holes, incorporating the effects of angular momentum, demonstrating that the Gouy-Stodola theorem can similarly derive the entropy-area law in this case. Additionally, we analyze the merging of two black holes, showing that the resultant total entropy exceeds the sum of the individual entropies, thereby adhering to the second law of thermodynamics. Our results suggest that gravitational surface tension is a key factor in black hole thermodynamics, providing a novel and coherent framework for understanding the entropy production in these extreme astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Configurational entropy and stability conditions of fermion and boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a remarkable study by M. Gleiser and N. Jiang (Phys. Rev. D {\bf 92}, 044046, 2015), the authors demonstrated that the stability regions of neutron stars, within the framework of the simple Fermi gas model, and self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar field (boson stars) with various self couplings, obtained through traditional perturbation methods, correlates with critical points of the configurational entropy with an accuracy of a few percent. Recently, P. Koliogiannis \textit{et al.} (Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 044069 2023) found that while the minimization of the configurational entropy generally anticipates qualitatively the stability point for neutron stars and quark stars, this approach lacks universal validity. In this work, we aim to further elucidate this issue by seeking to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, we calculate the configurational entropy of bosonic and fermionic systems, described by interacting Fermi and Boson gases, respectively, that form compact objects stabilized by gravity. We investigate whether the minimization of configurational entropy coincides with the stability point of the corresponding compact objects. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the stability points predicted by configurational entropy and those obtained through traditional methods, with the accuracy of this correlation showing a slight dependence on the interaction strength. Consequently, the stability of compact objects, composed of components obeying Fermi or Boson statistics, can alternatively be assessed using the concept of configurational entropy.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Revealing Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in NGC 1399 using SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the detectability of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within the mass range $10^2-10^5$ solar masses in the globular star clusters of NGC 1399 at a frequency of 300.00 MHz. Employing the theoretical Bondi accretion model and the empirical fundamental plane of black hole accretion, we estimate IMBH masses based on bolometric luminosity and X-ray/radio luminosities, respectively. By simulating a 3-hour observation of 77 globular cluster candidates using the Square Kilometer Array, we identify radio detection benchmarks indicative of accretion onto IMBHs. Our results show that IMBHs inside the globular star clusters located in NGC 1399 are indeed detectable, with the Bondi accretion model providing IMBH mass estimates ranging from $2.93 \times 10^{3.0\pm 0.39}$ to $7.43 \times 10^{4.0 \pm 0.39}$ solar masses, and the empirical fundamental-plane relation suggesting IMBH mass estimation with $3.41\times 10^{5.0 \pm 0.96}$ solar masses. These findings highlight the presence and detectability of IMBHs in globular clusters, offering insights into their role as precursors to supermassive black holes and enriching our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Late Radio Emission from Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present radio observations of 23 optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) on timescales of 500-3200 days post discovery. We detect nine new TDEs that did not have detectable radio emission at earlier times, indicating a late-time brightening after several hundred (and up to 2300) days; an additional seven TDEs exhibit radio emission whose origin is ambiguous or may be attributed to the host galaxy or an active galactic nucleus. We also report a new rising component in one TDE previously detected in the radio at 10^3 days. While the radio emission in some of the detected TDEs peaked on a timescale 2-4 yr, over half of the sample still show rising emission. The range of luminosities for the sample is 10^37-10^39 erg/s, about 2 orders of magnitude below the radio luminosity of the relativistic TDE Sw J1644+57. Our data set indicates 40% of all optical TDEs are detected in radio hundreds to thousands of days after discovery, and that this is probably more common than early radio emission peaking at 10^2 days. Using an equipartition analysis, we find evidence for a delayed launch of the radio-emitting outflows, with delay timescales of 500-2000 days, inferred velocities of 0.02-0.15c, and kinetic energies of 10^47-10^49 erg. We rule out off axis relativistic jets as a viable explanation for this population, and conclude delayed outflows are a more likely explanation, possibly from delayed disk formation. We conclude late radio emission marks a fairly ubiquitous but heretofore overlooked phase of TDE evolution.</description>

Abstract: We identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A compatible with shaping by at least two, and more likely more than four, pairs of opposite jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core-collapse supernovae. Using an old Spitzer Telescope infrared map of argon, we identify seven pairs of opposite morphological features that we connect with lines that cross each other at the same point on the plane of the sky. The opposite morphological features include protrusions, clumps, filaments, and funnels in the main SNR shell. In addition to these seven symmetry axes, we find two tentative symmetry axes (lines). These lines form a point-symmetric wind-rose. We place this point-symmetric wind-rose on a new JWST and X-ray images of Cassiopeia A. We find other morphological features and one more symmetry axis that strengthen the identified point-symmetric morphology. Not all symmetry axes correspond to jets; e.g., some clumps are formed by the compression of ejecta between two jet-inflated lobes (bubbles). The robust point-symmetric morphology in the iconic Cassiopeia A SNR strongly supports the JJEM and poses a severe challenge to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.</description>

      <title>Implication of Jet Physics from MeV Line Emission of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic jets are believed to play important role in producing prompt emission and afterglow of gamma-ray burst (GRB), but the nature of the jet is poorly known owing to the lack of decisive features observed in the prompt emission. The discovery of emission line evolving from about 37 MeV to 6 MeV in the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe GRB-jet physics. The time evolution of the central energy of the line with power-law index $-1$ is naturally explained by high-latitude curvature effect. Under the assumption that the line emission is generated in the prompt emission by $e^\pm$ pair production, cooling and annihilation in the jet, we can strictly constrain jet physics with observed line-emission properties. We find that the radius of the emission region is $r\gtrsim10^{16}$ cm. The narrow line width of $\sim10\%$ requires that the line emission occurs within 10\% of the dynamical time, which further implies short timescales of pair cooling to non-relativistic state and pair annihilation, and a slightly clumpy emission region. If the jet's Lorentz factor is $\Gamma\gtrsim400$, the fast cooling requirement needs an energy density of magnetic field in the jet much larger than that of prompt gamma-rays, i.e., a magnetically dominated jet. The temporal behavior of line flux suggests some angle dependence of line emission. We also discuss the difficulties of other scenarios for the observed emission line.</description>

      <title>The Intrabinary Shock and Companion Star of Redback Pulsar J2215+5135</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSR J2215+5135 (J2215) is a `redback' spider pulsar, where the intrabinary shock (IBS) wraps around the pulsar rather than the stellar-mass companion. Spider orbital light curves are modulated, dominated by their binary companion thermal emission in the optical bands and by IBS synchrotron emission in the X-rays. We report on new XMM-Newton X-ray and U-band observations of J2215. We produce orbital light curves and use them to model the system properties. Our best-fit optical light model gives a neutron star mass $M_{NS}=1.98\pm0.08$ M$_\odot$, lower than previously reported. However, uncertainty in the stellar atmosphere metallicity, a parameter to which J2215 is unusually sensitive, requires us to consider an acceptable systematic plus statistical range of $M_{NS}\sim1.85-2.3$ M$_\odot$. From the X-ray analysis, we find that the IBS wraps around the pulsar, but with a pulsar wind to companion wind momentum ratio unusually close to unity, implying a flatter IBS geometry than seen in other spiders. Estimating the companion wind momentum and speed from the X-ray light curve, we find a companion mass-loss rate of ${\dot M}_c\gtrsim10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, so that J2215 may become an isolated millisecond pulsar in $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our X-ray analyses place constraints on the magnetization and particle density of the pulsar wind and support models of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the highly magnetized relativistic IBS.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the asphericities in the explosion and multi-faceted circumstellar matter of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. Earlier studies have provided compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in SN~2023ixf revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 d, 6.4 d, and 79.2 d, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post 16 d. Hydrodynamical light curve modeling indicated a progenitor of 10 solar mass with a radius of 470 solar radii and explosion energy of 2e51 erg, along with 0.06 solar mass of 56-Ni, though these properties are not unique due to modeling degeneracies. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5e14 cm, with a mass-loss rate of 1e-2 solar mass per year, and an extended CSM spanning from 5e14 cm to at least 1e16cm with a mass-loss rate of 1e-4 solar mass per year, both assuming a wind-velocity of 10 km/s. The early nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [OI], red-ward attenuation of the emission of Halpha post 125 days, and flattening in the Ks-band, marking the onset of dust formation.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Arrested Circumbinary Accretion Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary systems with comparable masses and a surrounding accretion disk can accrete gas through spiral accretion streams penetrating the central cavity formed by tidal interactions. Using three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we investigate the possibility of a magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity. Rather than solely continuously feeding the binary through spiral accretion streams, the accretion is regulated by the strong magnetic field inside the cavity. Transport of mass and angular momentum onto the binary then proceeds largely periodically in magnetic flux eruption episodes. The ejected flux tubes carry angular momentum outwards and away from the binary, inject hot plasma into the disk and can launch flares. This likely intermittent scenario could have potential implications for the emission signatures of supermassive black hole binaries, and shed light onto the role magnetic fields play in the binary's orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto exotic compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the extensions to general relativity and to the Standard Model of particle physics predict families of hypothetical compact objects, collectively known as exotic compact objects (ECOs). This category can be defined to encompass non-Kerr black holes both within and beyond general relativity, as well as horizonless compact objects such as boson stars. In order to model observational signatures and identify possible detections, it is crucial to understand the interaction between these objects and their surrounding medium, usually plasmas described by the equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). To this end, we review the existent literature on GRMHD simulations of accretion onto these objects. These cover a variety of objects and accretion patterns. We conclude by listing possible directions to continue exploring this relatively young field.</description>

      <title>Repeated partial disruptions in a WD-NS or WD-BH merger modulate the prompt emission of long-duration merger-type GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been an unresolved issue. GRB 230307A stands out as an exceptionally bright event, belonging to the long-duration GRBs but also exhibiting a late emission component reminiscent of a kilonova. Together with the similar events GRBs 060614 and 211211A, they make up a new sub-group of GRBs with intriguing progenitors. If such long-duration merger-type GRBs originated from the coalescence of a white dwarf (WD) with a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH), as proposed in the recent literature, then the larger tidal disruption radius of the WD, together with a non-negligible residual orbital eccentricity, would make repeated partial tidal disruptions inevitable. This may modulate the mass accretion and jet launching process at the NS or BH, resulting in a quasi-periodic modulation (QPM) in the light curve of the GRB, on the orbital period. The detection of potential QPMs during the early episode of prompt emission of these three GRBs supports this scenario, and the relatively slow QPM ($&gt;$ 1 s) suggests that the lighter object can not be a NS. We propose that the progenitor system of GRBs 230307A, 060614, and 211211A consist of a WD of mass 1.3 $M_\odot$, 0.9 $M_\odot$ and 1.4 $M_\odot$, respectively, and a NS (or BH). After several cycles of modulations, the WD is completely destructed, and the accretion of the remaining debris dominates the extended emission episode.</description>

      <title>New results on the gamma-ray burst variability-luminosity relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the dawn of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow era, a Cepheid-like correlation was discovered between time variability V and isotropic-equivalent peak luminosity Liso of the prompt emission of about a dozen long GRBs with measured redshift available at that time. Soon afterwards, the correlation was confirmed against a sample of about 30 GRBs, despite being affected by significant scatter. Unlike the minimum variability timescale (MVT), V measures the relative power of short-to-intermediate timescales. We aim to test the correlation using about two hundred long GRBs with spectroscopically measured redshift, detected by Swift, Fermi, and Konus/WIND, for which both observables can be accurately estimated. For all the selected GRBs, variability was calculated according to the original definition using the 64-ms background-subtracted light curves of Swift/BAT (Fermi/GBM) in the 15-150 (8-900) keV energy passband. Peak luminosities were either taken from literature or derived from modelling broad-band spectra acquired with either Konus/WIND or Fermi/GBM. The statistical significance of the correlation has weakened to &lt;~2%, mostly due to the appearance of a number of smooth and luminous GRBs characterised by a relatively small V. At odds with most long GRBs, 3 out of 4 long-duration merger candidates have high V and low Liso. Luminosity is more tightly connected with shortest timescales measured by MVT rather than short-to-intermediate ones, measured by V. We discuss the implications on internal dissipation models and the role of the e+- photosphere. We identified a few, smooth GRBs with a single broad pulse and low V, that might have an external shock origin, in contrast with most GRBs. The combination of high variability (V&gt;~0.1), low luminosity (Liso&lt;~10^51 erg s^-1) and short MVT (&lt;~ 0.1 s) could be a good indicator for a compact binary merger origin.</description>

      <title>Identification of Gravitational-waves from Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detectors like TianQin or LISA could observe extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals (EMRIs) at millihertz frequencies. The accurate identification of these EMRI signals from the data plays a crucial role in enabling in-depth study of astronomy and physics. We aim at the identification stage of the data analysis, with the aim to extract key features of the signal from the data, such as the evolution of the orbital frequency, as well as to pinpoint the parameter range that can fit the data well for the subsequent parameter inference stage. In this manuscript, we demonstrated the identification of EMRI signals without any additional prior information on physical parameters. High-precision measurements of EMRI signals have been achieved, using a hierarchical search. It combines the search for physical parameters that guide the subsequent parameter inference, and a semi-coherent search with phenomenological waveforms that reaches precision levels down to $10^{-4}$ for the phenomenological waveform parameters $\omega_{0}$, $\dot{\omega}_{0}$, and $\ddot{\omega}_{0}$. As a result, we obtain measurement relative errors of less than 4% for the mass of the massive black hole, while keeping the relative errors of the other parameters within as small as 0.5%.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos with large self-interactions, arising from exchange of light scalars or vectors with mass $M_\phi\simeq 10{\rm MeV}$, can play a useful role in cosmology for structure formation and solving the Hubble tension. It has been proposed that large self-interactions of neutrinos may change the observed properties of supernova like the neutrino luminosity or the duration of the neutrino burst. In this paper, we study the gravitational wave memory signal arising from supernova neutrinos. Our results reveal that memory signal for self-interacting neutrinos are weaker than free-streaming neutrinos in the high frequency range. Implications for detecting and differentiating between such signals for planned space-borne detectors, DECIGO and BBO, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Hawking Evaporation opens new Mass Window for Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy injection through Hawking evaporation has been used to put strong constraints on primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate at masses below $10^{17}\,\rm{g}$. However, Hawking's semiclassical approximation breaks down at latest after half-decay. Beyond this point, the evaporation could be significantly suppressed, as was shown in recent work. In this study, we review existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds on primordial black holes, taking this effect into account. We show that the constraints disappear completely for a reasonable range of parameters, which opens a new window below $10^{10}\,\rm{g}$ for light primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Separating States in Astronomical Sources Using Hidden Markov Models: With a Case Study of Flaring and Quiescence on EV Lac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to distinguish between different states (e.g., high and low, quiescent and flaring) in astronomical sources with count data. The method models the underlying physical process as latent variables following a continuous-space Markov chain that determines the expected Poisson counts in observed light curves in multiple passbands. For the underlying state process, we consider several autoregressive processes, yielding continuous-space hidden Markov models of varying complexity. Under these models, we can infer the state that the object is in at any given time. The continuous state predictions from these models are then dichotomized with the help of a finite mixture model to produce state classifications. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the active dMe flare star EV Lac, splitting the data into quiescent and flaring states. We find that a first-order vector autoregressive process efficiently separates flaring from quiescence: flaring occurs over 30-40% of the observation durations, a well-defined persistent quiescent state can be identified, and the flaring state is characterized by higher plasma temperatures and emission measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) constitutes the last observable prediction of the standard cosmological model, which has yet to be detected directly. In this work, we show how the coherent scattering of neutrinos off dense neutron matter can lead to an additional cooling channel in neutron stars (NSs). We also include the effects of gravitational capture and boosting, but find that the cooling is efficient only in the presence of large overdensities. We further discuss the prediction of a boosted C$\nu$B flux on Earth from nearby NSs and the potential detection prospects in the case of a future nearby galactic supernova. Although currently these ideas do not offer any detection prospects, they can be used to constrain overdensities on short length scales $\mathcal{O}(10\text{ km})$. We also discuss the impact of new physics scenarios, such as long-range forces, on NS cooling through the C$\nu$B.</description>

Abstract: In any extension of General Relativity (GR), extra fundamental degrees of freedom couple to gravity. Besides deforming GR forecasts in a theory-dependent way, this coupling generically introduces extra modes in the gravitational-wave signal. We propose a novel theory-agnostic test of gravity to search for these nongravitational modes in black hole merger ringdown signals. To leading order in the GR deviations, their frequencies and damping times match those of a test scalar or vector field in a Kerr background, with only amplitudes and phases as free parameters. This test will be highly valuable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.05 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.008 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes. By applying this test to GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find that the current evidence for an extra mode is comparable to that for the first gravitational overtone, but its inclusion modifies the inferred remnant spin.</description>
