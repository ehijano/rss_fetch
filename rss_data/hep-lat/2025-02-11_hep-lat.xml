      <title>Nucleon axial, tensor, and scalar charges and $\sigma$-terms in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the nucleon axial, scalar and tensor charges at the continuum limit by analyzing three $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermion ensembles with all quark masses tuned to approximately their physical values. We include all contributions from valence and sea quarks. We use the Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate systematic errors due to excited states and the continuum extrapolation. For the nucleon isovector axial charge we find $g_A^{u-d}=1.250(24)$, in agreement with the experimental value. We compute the axial, tensor and scalar charges for each quark flavor. The axial charge provides crucial information on the intrinsic spin carried by quark in the nucleon and the the latter two provide input for experimental searches of physics beyond the standard model. Moreover, we extract the nucleon $\sigma$-terms and find $\sigma_{\pi N}=41.9(8.1)$ MeV, for the strange $\sigma_{s}=30(17)$ MeV and for the charm $\sigma_{c}=82(29)$ MeV. We also present preliminary results on the isovector quantities using a fourth ensemble at smaller lattice spacing.</description>

      <title>Improvement in Autocorrelation Times Measured by the Master-Field Technique using Field Transformation HMC in 2+1 Domain Wall Fermion Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Field-Transformation Hybrid Monte-Carlo (FTHMC) algorithm potentially mitigates the issue of critical slowing down by combining the HMC with a field transformation, originally proposed by L\"{u}scher and motivated as trivializing the theory. For the transformation, we use a single invertible discrete smearing step inspired by the Wilson flow but which resembles a Jacobian-computable generalisation of the stout smearing step. This is applied to a system with Iwasaki gauge fields and 2+1 Domain-Wall fermions. We have studied the effect of different smearing parameter values on autocorrelation times of Wilson-flowed energies with different flow time. We have found a reduction of exponential autocorrelation times for infra-red observables such as Wilson flowed energy densities and topological charge densities when a larger value of the smearing parameter is used. The autocorrelation times of local observables are computed using an approach akin to the master-field technique, allowing us to estimate the effect of the field transformation with different parameters based on a small number of configurations.</description>

      <title>Physics-Conditioned Diffusion Models for Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop diffusion models for simulating lattice gauge theories, where stochastic quantization is explicitly incorporated as a physical condition for sampling. We demonstrate the applicability of this novel sampler to U(1) gauge theory in two spacetime dimensions and find that a model trained at a small inverse coupling constant can be extrapolated to larger inverse coupling regions without encountering the topological freezing problem. Additionally, the trained model can be employed to sample configurations on different lattice sizes without requiring further training. The exactness of the generated samples is ensured by incorporating Metropolis-adjusted Langevin dynamics into the generation process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach enables more efficient sampling of topological quantities compared to traditional algorithms such as Hybrid Monte Carlo and Langevin simulations.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD study of $\Lambda_c \Lambda_c$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice result of the near threshold $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c$ scattering with $I(J^P) = 0(0^+)$. The calculation is performed on two $N_f = 2+1$ Wilson-Clover ensembles with pion mass $m_\pi \approx 303 $MeV and lattice spacing $a\approx 0.07746$fm. The L\"uscher's finite volume method is utilized to extract the scattering parameters from the finite-volume spectrum. The coupled channel $\Xi_{cc}N$ is ignored in the scattering analysis based on the observation that the energy levels computed from the $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c$ and $\Xi_{cc}N$ operators do not mix. The $\Sigma_c\Sigma_c$ channel is not included either since the energy range explored in this study is well below its threshold. Our results indicate that the interaction in the $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c$ single channel is repulsive, and the scattering length is determined to be $a_0 = -0.21(4)(7) \mathrm{fm}$, where the first error is the statistical error and the second is the systematic error.</description>

      <title>Qubit Regurlarization of Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory for two-particle system containing long-range potential on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic method to block-diagonalize the finite volume effective Hamiltonian for two-particle system with arbitrary spin in both the rest and moving frames. The framework is convenient and efficient for addressing the left-hand cut issue arising from the long-range potential, which are challenging in the framework of standard L\"ushcer formula. Furthermore, the method provides a foundation for further extension to the three-particle system. We first benchmark our approach by examining several toy models, demonstrating its consistency with the standard L\"ushcer formula in the absence of long-range interactions. In the presence of long-range potential, we investigate and resolve the effect of left-hand cut. As a realistic application, we calculate the finite volume spectrum of isoscalar $D\bar{D}^*$ system, where the well-known exotic state $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is observed. The results are qualitatively consistent with the lattice QCD calculation, highlighting the reliability and potential application of our framework to the study of other exotic states in the hadron physics.</description>

      <title>Phase structure analysis of CP(1) model with $\theta$ term by tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the phase structure of 2d lattice CP(1) model with $\theta$ term by using the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group method. We propose a new tensor network representation for the model using the quadrature scheme and confirm that its accuracy is better than that of the conventional character-like expansion. As a probe to study the phase structure, we adopt the central charge and the scaling dimensions. The numerical results indicate an existence of critical point at $\theta=\pi$, which is consistent with the Haldane's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Screening Mass at Finite Temperature and Magnetic Field from Lattice QCD with Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the screening mass of pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field is crucial for comprehending the behavior of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the early universe or inside neutron stars. Additionally, in heavy ion collisions, strong magnetic fields are generated, which could significantly influence the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. The study of these screening masses provides insight into the modifications of mesonic properties in such environments, which is essential for the theoretical understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions and the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. Here, we present continuum estimated lattice QCD results on the screening mass of neutral pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperatures and nonzero magnetic fields. The simulations used (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations using physical quark masses employing the HISQ/tree action. The continuum estimation was carried out using lattices having temporal extents $N_\tau$ = 8, 12, and 16, all having aspect ratio $N_\sigma/N_\tau$ = 4. The investigated temperature ranges from 145 MeV to 166 MeV, while the magnetic field strength varies from 0 to 1 GeV$^2$. We discuss the dependence of the screening masses of various neutral pseudoscalar mesons on temperature, magnetic field strength, and quark mass.</description>

      <title>Gauge Dependence of ccbar Potential from Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter Wave Function in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gauge dependence of $c\bar{c}$ potentials extracted from Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions. The potentials are obtained using the HAL QCD potential method, with an extension introduced by Kawanai and Sasaki for self-consistent determination of the charm quark mass. A systematic comparison is conducted between results obtained in the Coulomb and Landau gauges. The numerical calculations are performed using 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations with the charm quark treated in the quenched approximation. We find that the central potentials in both gauges show excellent agreement at short distances but exhibit discrepancies at large distances. We attribute these discrepancies to insufficient suppression of excited-state contamination in the Landau gauge, which affects the linear-rising behavior of the potential at large distance.</description>

      <title>Axialvector diqaurk Mass and quark-diquark potential in Sigma_c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axialvector diquark is studied by using 2+1 flavor Lattice QCD. Being a two-quark object, diquark has a non-neutral color charge. Hence the two-point correlators of diquark fields do not have a particle pole due to the color confinement of QCD, and it is not straightforward to study the diquark mass by lattice QCD by using an exponential fit of a temporal two-point correlator. In order to avoid this difficulty, our strategy is to regard the diquark mass as a mass parameter of an effective quark-diquark model which is constructed by using an extended HAL QCD method based on equal-time quark-diquark Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions. We attempt to calculate the axial-vector diquark mass and the quark-diquark potentials between a charm quark and an axial-vector diquark in the $\Sigma_c$ baryon. Lattice QCD Monte Carlo calculation is performed by using the 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations generated on $32^3\times 64$ lattice by PACS-CS Collaboration which corresponds to the pion mass of about 700 MeV. As a result, a quark-diquark central potential of Cornell-type and a short-ranged spin-dependent potential are obtained. However, from a quantitative point of view, the ground state convergence of the NBS wave functions are not sufficient so that we obtain a larger string tension and a smaller axial-vector diquark mass than we have expected phenomenologically.</description>

      <title>The isoscalar non-singlet axial form factor of the nucleon from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our progress on the computation of the axial form factor of the nucleon with flavour structure $u+d-2s$ from lattice QCD. We employ a set of $N_f=2+1$ CLS ensembles with $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions and the L\"uscher-Weisz gauge action, with lattice spacings ranging from $0.05\,\text{fm}$ to $0.086\,\text{fm}$ and pion masses spanning between $130\,\text{MeV}$ and $350\,\text{MeV}$. We employ multiple source-sink separations and use the summation method to suppress the contamination from excited states. We use a $z$-expansion on each ensemble to parametrize the $Q^2$-dependence of the form factor and simultaneously fit the available source-sink separations for all $Q^2\leq 0.7 \,{\rm GeV}^2$. We outline our analysis of the stability of the fits varying the ans\"atze and different estimations of the covariance matrix and report on our strategy for a comprehensive determination of the physical form factor.</description>

      <title>The chiral critical point from the strong coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling expansion for staggered fermions allows for Monte Carlo simulations using a dual representation. It has a mild sign problem for low values of the inverse gauge coupling $\beta$, hence the phase diagram in the full $\mu_B - T$ plane can be evaluated. We have extended this framework to include $\mathcal{O}(\beta)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\beta^2)$ corrections, by mapping the degrees of freedom to a vertex model. We present results on the $\beta$-dependence of the chiral critical point from those simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute ratios between the vector and pseudoscalar, and tensor and vector decay constants, and between hyperfine splittings for $D_{(s)}^{(*)}$ and $B_{(s)}^{(*)}$ mesons. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action for all valence quarks, paired with the second generation MILC $n_f = 2+1+1$ HISQ gluon field configurations. These include light sea quarks with $m_u = m_d \equiv m_l$ going down to the physical values, as well as physically tuned strange and charm sea quarks. We also use a HISQ valence heavy quark, with mass ranging from that of the $c$-quark up to very nearly that of the physical $b$-quark on the finest lattices, allowing us to map out the heavy-quark mass dependence of the decay constant and hyperfine splitting ratios.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axion-like particles using lattice QCD calculations of the rate for $J/\psi \to \gamma a$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key search mode for axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to charm quarks is $J/\psi \to \gamma a$. Here we calculate the form factor that allows the rate of this process to be determined using lattice QCD for the first time. Our calculations use the relativistic Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action for the valence charm quarks on gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration that include $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ HISQ quarks in the sea at four values of the lattice spacing and both unphysical and physical sea quark masses. We determine the form factor as a function of ALP mass with an uncertainty of less than 2\% across our full range of ALP masses from zero up to 95\% of the $J/\psi$ mass. This represents a substantial improvement in accuracy of the theoretical picture of this decay compared to the previously used tree-level and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ perturbation theory. We use our form factor to determine constraints on ALP masses and couplings to charm quarks and photons in several different scenarios using recent experimental data from BESIII. Our calculation paves the way for further lattice QCD input on new physics constraints from radiative decays.</description>

Abstract: We report novel theoretical results for the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition, utilizing a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) formalism. In this approach, both nucleon, $N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+$, and $\Delta(1232)$'s parity partner, $\Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$, are treated as quark-diquark composites, with their internal structures governed accordingly by a tractable truncation of the Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation. Nonpointlike quark+quark (diquark) correlations within baryons, which are deeply tied to the processes driving hadron mass generation, are inherently dynamic in the sense that they continually break apart and recombine guided by the Faddeev kernel. For the nucleon, isoscalar-scalar and isovector-axial-vector diquarks dominate, while the $\Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ state only includes contributions from isovector-axial-vector diquarks because the SCI-interaction excludes isovector-vector diquarks. Once the Faddeev wave function of the baryons involved in the electromagnetic transition is normalized taking into account that its elastic electric form factor must be one at the on-shell photon point, we compute the transition form factors that describe the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ reaction and, using algebraic relations, derive the corresponding helicity amplitudes. When comparing with experiment, our findings highlight a strong sensitivity of these observables to the internal structure of baryons, offering valuable insights. Although the SCI-framework has obvious limitations, its algebraic simplicity provides analytical predictions that serve as useful benchmarks for guiding more refined studies within QCD-based DSEs frameworks.</description>

      <title>Persistent spin grids with spin-orbit coupled 2D electron gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the diffusive spin dynamics of a 2D electron gas with spin-orbit coupling confined within a grid of narrow channels. We show that the lifetime of certain spin distributions in such grids greatly exceeds that in an unconfined 2D electron gas and diverges as the channel width approaches zero. Such persistent spin grids occur if the electron spin orientation remains invariant after diffusion around the grid plaquette. We establish a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification for persistent spin grids and speculate that the setup can be used to simulate non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Strong-Weak Coupling Duality in Scalar Lattice QFT with Application to Strong Coupling Decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11503v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dualities between quantum field theories have proven to be a powerful tool in various areas of physics. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective for obtaining strong coupling expansions based on a well-known technique -- the Field-space Fourier transform. We discuss the advantages of this approach for a class of Euclidean quantum field theories on a general lattice, with a focus on a self-interacting $\phi^4$ scalar field theory defined on a cubic lattice of arbitrary dimension. We establish a duality between the strong coupling regime of this theory and the weak coupling regime of a corresponding dual theory. Without loss of generality, we choose the original theory to be local and show that its dual action becomes nonlocal. Using standard diagrammatic techniques, we derive expansions for the two-point correlator and the free energy per site in the regime of large and intermediate coupling constants $g$. The obtained expansions remain regular in the limit $g \to 0$ and exhibit rapid numerical convergence in the considered regions. Numerical analysis in dimensions $d = 2$ and $d = 3$ demonstrates good agreement between our analytical results and Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we show that the strong coupling expansions are consistent with traditional weak coupling expansions.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>2024 Update on $\varepsilon_K$ with lattice QCD inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report recent progress on $\varepsilon_K$ evaluated directly from the standard model (SM) with lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, exclusive $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $|V_{ud}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $\xi_\text{LD}$, $f_K$, and $m_c$. We find that the standard model with exclusive $|V_{cb}|$ and lattice QCD inputs describes only $2/3 \cong 65\%$ of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$ and does not explain its remaining 35\%, which represents a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $5.1\sigma \sim 4.1\sigma$ level between the SM theory and experiment. We also find that this tension disappears when we use the inclusive value of $|V_{cb}|$ obtained using the heavy quark expansion based on the QCD sum rule approach. We also report results for $|\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method for $\eta_i$ of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension of $5.7\sigma \sim 4.2\sigma$ with lattice QCD inputs.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Anomalies of Hamiltonian Staggered Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the shift and time reversal symmetries of Hamiltonian staggered fermions and their connection to continuum symmetries concentrating in particular on the case of massless fermions and (3+1) dimensions. We construct operators using the staggered fields that implement these symmetries on finite lattices. We show that the elementary shift symmetry of a single staggered field depends on a $Z_4$ subgroup of an additional $U(1)$ phase symmetry and anti-commutes with time reversal. This latter property implies that time reversal symmetry will be broken if this phase symmetry is gauged - a mixed 't Hooft anomaly. However, this anomaly can be canceled for multiples of four staggered fields. Finally we observe that the naive continuum limit of the minimal anomaly free lattice model has the symmetries and matter representations of the Pati-Salam GUT.</description>

      <title>Three flavor QCD phase transition with M\"obius domain wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the $N_f=3$ QCD phase transition using M\"{o}bius domain wall fermions. Simulations were performed on $N_t=12$ lattices with aspect ratios ranging from 2 to 4 for various quark masses, at a lattice spacing of $a=0.1361(20)$ fm, corresponding to a temperature of 121(2) MeV. To clarify the nature of the phase transition, a large-volume lattice, $48^3 \times 12\times 16$, was added to analyze the volume dependence of disconnected chiral susceptibility. By examining the chiral condensate, disconnected chiral susceptibility, and Binder cumulant, and incorporating results from $24^3 \times 12 \times 16$ and $36^3 \times 12 \times 16$ lattices reported in earlier studies, we observe that the transition is consistent with a crossover at a quark mass of approximately $m_f^{\mathrm{\overline {MS}}}(2\, \mathrm{GeV}) \sim 4$ MeV at this temperature. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of residual chiral symmetry breaking on the chiral condensate and disconnected chiral susceptibility for different sizes in the 5th direction.</description>

      <title>Chiral perturbation theory and Bose-Einstein condensation in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present recent results in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory at finite isospin $\mu_I$ and strangeness $\mu_s$ chemical potentials at zero temperature. The phase diagram to ${\cal O}(p^2)$ in the $\mu_I$--$\mu_S$ plane is mapped out with and without electromagnetic effects. The phase diagram consists of a vacuum phase and three Bose-condensed phases with condensates of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $K^{0}/\bar{K}^0$, respectively. Including electromagnetic interactions, the Bose-condensed phases become Higgs phases via the Higgs mechanism. The tree-level spectrum for the mesons and gauge bosons is also derived. We calculate the pressure, energy density, isospin density, and speed of sound in the pion-condensed phase to ${\cal O}(p^4)$ for three-flavor $\chi$PT. The results are compared with recent lattice simulations and the agreement is very good for isospin chemical potentials up to approximately 200 MeV. Moreover, by integrating out the $s$-quark, we show that the thermodynamic quantities can be mapped onto their two-flavor counterparts with renormalized parameters. %to ${\cal O}(p^6)$ for two-flavor $\chi$PT in the chiral limit. We also consider the nonrelativistic limit. It is shown that the energy density can be matched onto the classic result by Lee, Huang and Yang (LHY) for a dilute Bose, with an $s$-wave scattering length that includes radiative corrections. The breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry in the Bose-condensed phases gives rise to a Goldstone bosons, whose dispersion is linear for momenta $p\ll\mu_I$. In this regime, we use Son's prescription to construct an effective theory for the Goldstone field which is valid in this regime. It is shown that its damping rate is of order $p^5$. This result is in agreement with Beliav's for a dilute Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness in U(1) lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of nonstabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</description>
