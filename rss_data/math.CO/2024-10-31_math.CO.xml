      <title>About posets of height one as retracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate connected posets $C$ of height one as retracts of finite posets $P$. We define two multigraphs: a multigraph $\mathfrak{F}(P)$ reflecting the network of so-called improper 4-crown bundles contained in the extremal points of $P$, and a multigraph $\mathfrak{C}(C)$ depending on $C$ but not on $P$. There exists a close interdependence between $C$ being a retract of $P$ and the existence of a graph homomorphism of a certain type from $\mathfrak{F}(P)$ to $\mathfrak{C}(C)$. In particular, if $C$ is an ordinal sum of two antichains, then $C$ is a retract of $P$ iff such a graph homomorphism exists. Returning to general connected posets $C$ of height one, we show that the image of such a graph homomorphism can be a clique in $\mathfrak{C}(C)$ iff the improper 4-crowns in $P$ contain only a sparse subset of the edges of $C$.</description>

      <title>Bijections for generalized Wilf equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with an inclusion-exclusion proof of a combinatorial identity, a direct bijection can be produced using recursive subtraction (sometimes with a direct combinatorial description). We apply this method to identities for generalized Wilf equivalences among consecutive patterns in inversion sequences, giving direct bijective proofs of some generalized Wilf equivalences shown by Auli and Elizalde. We also give new bijective proofs of a stronger relation among some consecutive patterns.</description>

      <title>Multifold Convolutions, Generating Functions and 1d Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multifold convolutions of a combinatorial sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$: namely, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the $k$-fold convolution is $\mathcal{M}^{(k)}_n(\boldsymbol{a}) = \sum_{j_1+\dots+j_k=n} a_{j_1} \cdots a_{j_k}$. Let $C_n$ be the Catalan numbers, and let $B_n$ be the central binomial coefficients. Then for random Dyck paths or simple random walk bridges, the multifold convolutions give moments of returns to the origin, using the stars-and-bars problem. There are well-known explicit formulas for the multifold convolutions of $C_n$ and $B_n$. But even for combinatorial sequences $B_n^2$ and $B_n^3$, one may determine asymptotics of multifold convolutions for large $n$. We also discuss large deviations.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Homing Shuffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of maps from $S_n \to S_n$ we call fixed point homing shuffles. These maps generalize a few known problems such as Conway's Topswops, and a card shuffling process studied by Gweneth McKinley. We show that the iterates of these homing shuffles always converge, and characterize the set $U_n$ of permutations that no homing shuffle sorts. We also study a homing shuffle that sorts anything not in $U_n$, and find how many iterations it takes to converge in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Packing Designs with large block size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given positive integers $v,k,t$ and $\lambda$ with $v \geq k \geq t$, a {packing design} PD$_{\lambda}(t,k,v)$ is a pair $(V,\mathcal{B})$, where $V$ is a $v$-set and $\mathcal{B}$ is a collection of $k$-subsets of $V$ such that each $t$-subset of $V$ appears in at most $\lambda$ elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The maximum size of a PD$_{\lambda}(t,k,v)$ is called the {packing number}, denoted PDN$_{\lambda}(t,k,v)$. In this paper we consider packing designs with $t=2$ and $k$ large (linear) relative to $v$.
  We provide a new bound on the packing number: if $n \geq \lambda+2$ and $nk-\binom{n}{\lambda+1} \leq \lambda v &lt; (n+1)k-\binom{n+1}{\lambda+1}$, then PDN$_{\lambda}(2,k,v) \leq n$. When $\lambda=1$ this is equivalent to the second Johnson bound. We show that this bound is met when $\lambda=1$ and $n$ is a positive integer, and when $\lambda=2$ and $2 \leq n \leq 6$. We also consider a directed variant and show that for the cases we consider, this has the same packing number as the undirected case with $\lambda=2$.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds of Steklov eigenvalues on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ and $B$ be the maximum vertex degree and a subset of vertices in a graph $G$ respectively. In this paper, we study the first (non-trivial) Steklov eigenvalue $\sigma_2$ of $G$ with boundary $B$. Using metrical deformation via flows, we first show that $\sigma_2 = \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\Delta(g+1)^3}{|B|}\right)$ for graphs of orientable genus $g$ if $|B| \geq \max\{3 \sqrt{g},|V|^{\frac{1}{4} + \epsilon}, 9\}$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$. This can be seen as a discrete analogue of Karpukhin's bound. Secondly, we prove that $\sigma_2 \leq \frac{8\Delta+4X}{|B|}$ based on planar crossing number $X$. Thirdly, we show that $\sigma_2 \leq \frac{|B|}{|B|-1} \cdot \delta_B$, where $\delta_B$ denotes the minimum degree for boundary vertices in $B$. At last, we compare several upper bounds on Laplacian eigenvalues and Steklov eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to stability results for Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celebrated results often unfold like episodes in a long-running series. In the field of extremal set thoery, Erd\H{o}s, Ko, and Rado in 1961 established that any $k$-uniform intersecting family on $[n]$ has a maximum size of $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$, with the unique extremal structure being a star. In 1967, Hilton and Milner followed up with a pivotal result, showing that if such a family is not a star, its size is at most $\binom{n-1}{k-1} - \binom{n-k-1}{k-1} + 1$, and they identified the corresponding extremal structures. In recent years, Han and Kohayakawa, Kostochka and Mubayi, and Huang and Peng have provided the second and third levels of stability results in this line of research.
  In this paper, we provide a unified approach to proving the stability result for the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem at any level. Our framework primarily relies on a robust linear algebra method, which leverages appropriate non-shadows to effectively handle the structural complexities of these intersecting families.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Tokushige for cross-$t$-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families of sets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are called cross-$t$-intersecting if $|A\cap B|\ge t$ for all $A\in \mathcal{A}$, $B\in \mathcal{B}$. An active problem in extremal set theory is to determine the maximum product of sizes of cross-$t$-intersecting families. This incorporates the classical Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado (EKR) problem. In the present paper, we prove that if $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are cross-$t$-intersecting families of $\binom {[n]}k$ with $k\ge t\ge 3$ and $n\ge (t+1)(k-t+1)$, then $|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}|\le {\binom{n-t}{k-t}}^2$; moreover, if $n&gt;(t+1)(k-t+1)$, then equality holds if and only if $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{B}$ is a maximum $t$-intersecting subfamily of $\binom{[n]}{k}$. This confirms a conjecture of Tokushige for $t\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Universal graph series and vertex-weighted version of chromatic symmetric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on two specific generalizations of the chromatic symmetric function: one involving universal graphs and the other concerning vertex-weighted graphs. In this paper, we introduce a unified generalization that incorporates both approaches and demonstrate that the resulting new invariants inherit characteristics from each, particularly the properties of complete invariants. Additionally, we construct complete invariants for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and partially ordered sets (posets). As a corollary, these invariants can distinguish hyperplane arrangements that are distinguishable by their intersection posets.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'arf\'as conjecture on graphs without long induced paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1994, Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'arf\'as conjectured that every graph with minimum degree at least 3 has a cycle of length a power of 2. In 2022, Gao and Shan (Graphs and Combinatorics) proved that the conjecture is true for $P_8$-free graphs, i.e., graphs without any induced copies of a path on 8 vertices. In 2024, Hu and Shen (Discrete Mathematics) improved this result by proving that the conjecture is true for $P_{10}$-free graphs. With the aid of a computer search, we improve this further by proving that the conjecture is true for $P_{13}$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Deduction, Constrained Zero Forcing, and Constrained Searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deduction is a recently introduced graph searching process in which searchers clear the vertex set of a graph with one move each, with each searcher's movement determined by which of its neighbors are protected by other searchers. In this paper, we show that the minimum number of searchers required to clear the graph is the same in deduction as in constrained versions of other previously studied graph processes, namely zero forcing and fast-mixed search. We give a structural characterization, new bounds and a spectrum result on the number of searchers required. We consider the complexity of computing this parameter, giving an NP-completeness result for arbitrary graphs, and exhibiting families of graphs for which the parameter can be computed in polynomial time. We also describe properties of the deduction process related to the timing of searcher movement and the success of terminal layouts.</description>

      <title>Bounding the parameter $\beta$ of a distance-regular graph with classical parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a distance-regular graph with classical parameters $(D, b, \alpha, \beta)$ satisfying $b\geq 2$ and $D\geq 3$. Let $r=1+b+b^2+\cdots+b^{D-1}$. In 1999, K. Metsch showed that there exists a positive constant $C(\alpha,b)$ only depending on $\alpha$ and $b$, such that if $\beta \geq C(\alpha, b)r^2$, then either $\Gamma$ is a Grassmann graph or a bilinear forms graph.
  In this work, we show that for $b\geq 2$ and $D\geq 3$, then there exists a constant $C_1(\alpha, b)$ only depending on $\alpha$ and $b$, such that if $\beta \geq C_1(\alpha, b)r$, then either $\Gamma$ is a Grassmann graph, a bilinear forms graph, or a geometric distance-regular graph whose local graphs are the $\alpha$-clique extensions of a $\frac{\beta}{\alpha} \times r$-grid.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard multiary quasigroup product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hadamard quasigroup product has recently been introduced as a natural generalization of the classical Hadamard product of matrices. It is defined as the superposition operator of three binary operations, one of them being a quasigroup operation. This paper delves into the fundamentals of this superposition operator by considering its more general version over multiary groupoids. Particularly, we show how this operator preserves algebraic identities, multiary groupoid structures, inverse elements, isotopes, conjugates and orthogonality. Then, we generalize the mentioned Hadamard quasigroup product to multiary quasigroups. Based on this product, we prove that the number of $m$-ary quasigroups defined on a given set $X$ coincides with the number of $m$-ary operations that are orthogonal to a given $m$-set of orthogonal $m$-ary operations over $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that descents and excedances are equidistributed in the symmetric group. We show that the descent and excedance enumerators, summed over permutations with a fixed first letter are identical when we perform a simple change of the first letter. We generalize this to type B and other colored permutation groups. We are led to defining descents and excedances through linear orders. With respect to a particular order, when the number of colors is even, we get a result that generalizes the type B results. Lastly, we get a type B counterpart of Conger's result which refines the well known Carlitz identity.</description>

      <title>Heffter arrays over partial loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Heffter array over an additive group $G$ is any partially filled array $A$ satisfying that: (1) each one of its rows and columns sum to zero in $G$, and (2) if $i\in G\setminus\{0\}$, then either $i$ or $-i$ appears exactly once in $A$. In this paper, this notion is naturally generalized to that of $\mathcal{B}$-Heffter array over a partial loop, where $\mathcal{B}$ is a set of block-sum polynomials over an affine $1$-design on the set of entries in $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-firing is a combinatorial game played on a graph in which we place and disperse chips on vertices until a stable state is reached. We study a chip-firing variant played on an infinite rooted directed $k$-ary tree, where we place $k^\ell$ chips on the root for some positive integer $\ell$, and we say a vertex $v$ can fire if it has at least $k$ chips. A vertex fires by dispersing one chip to each out-neighbor. Once every vertex has less than $k$ chips, we reach a stable configuration since no vertex can fire. We determine the exact number and properties of the possible stable configurations of chips in the setting where chips are distinguishable.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we study the "tight gates" of the cone type partition of a Coxeter group $W$; a partition giving rise to the minimal automaton recognising the language of reduced words of $W$ recently studied by Parkinson and Yau (2022) and Przytycki and Yau (2024). We show that the tight gates are the join-irreducible elements of the smallest Garside shadow of $W$ and more generally, that "tight" elements are the join-irreducibles of convex Garside shadows. We study the properties of the tight gates and show that they also act as a gate of the witnesses of boundary roots of cone types and that they are closed under suffix. As an application of these results, we give a very efficient method of determining whether two elements have the same cone type without having to compute the minimal automaton. We also apply our results to explicitly describe the set of ultra-low elements in some select classes of Coxeter groups, thereby verifying a conjecture of Parkinson and Yau for these groups. Furthermore, we explicitly describe the set of tight gates in these cases.</description>

      <title>Sampling and counting triangle-free graphs near the critical density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the following combinatorial counting and sampling problems: can we efficiently sample from the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$ conditioned on triangle-freeness? Can we efficiently approximate the probability that $G(n,p)$ is triangle-free? These are prototypical instances of forbidden substructure problems ubiquitous in combinatorics. The algorithmic questions are instances of approximate counting and sampling for a hypergraph hard-core model.
  Estimating the probability that $G(n,p)$ has no triangles is a fundamental question in probabilistic combinatorics and one that has led to the development of many important tools in the field. Through the work of several authors, the asymptotics of the logarithm of this probability are known if $p =o( n^{-1/2})$ or if $p =\omega( n^{-1/2})$. The regime $p = \Theta(n^{-1/2})$ is more mysterious, as this range witnesses a dramatic change in the the typical structural properties of $G(n,p)$ conditioned on triangle-freeness. As we show, this change in structure has a profound impact on the performance of sampling algorithms.
  We give two different efficient sampling algorithms for triangle-free graphs (and complementary algorithms to approximate the triangle-freeness large deviation probability), one that is efficient when $p &lt; c/\sqrt{n}$ and one that is efficient when $p &gt; C/\sqrt{n}$ for constants $c, C&gt;0$. The latter algorithm involves a new approach for dealing with large defects in the setting of sampling from low-temperature spin models.</description>

Abstract: We show that if all the finite coset spaces of a polycyclic group have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size then the group is virtually nilpotent. We obtain the same conclusion for a finitely generated residually torsion-free nilpotent group under the weaker assumption that the finite quotient groups have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size. This extends work of Khukhro and Valette.</description>

Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of \emph{majorization} relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of bistochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove new exact finite-$n$ results in the case of \emph{UT-majorization} relation, i.e.,\ when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a general method to prove quantitative improvements on correlation inequalities and apply it to arm estimates for Bernoulli bond percolation on the square lattice. Our first result is that the two-arm exponent is strictly larger than twice the one-arm exponent and can be seen as a quantitative improvement on the Harris-FKG inequality. This answers a question of Garban and Steif, which was motivated by the study of exceptional times in dynamical percolation. Our second result is that the monochromatic arm exponents are strictly larger than their polychromatic versions, and can be seen as a quantitative improvement on Reimer's main lemma. This second result is not new and was already proved by Beffara and Nolin using a different argument.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Wirtinger number of links, an invariant originally defined by Blair et al. in terms of extending initial colorings of some strands of a diagram to the entire diagram, to spatial graphs. We prove that the Wirtinger number equals the bridge index of spatial graphs, and we implement an algorithm in Python which gives a more efficient way to estimate upper bounds of bridge indices. Combined with lower bounds from diagram colorings by elements from certain algebraic structures, we obtain exact bridge indices for a large family of spatial graphs.</description>

Abstract: Sets satisfying Central sets theorem and other Ramsey theoretic large sets were studied extensively in literature. Hindman and Strauss proved that product of some of these large sets is again large. In this paper we show that if we take two combinatorially large sets along idempotent filters, then their product is also a filter large set. The techniques used here to prove our results are completely elementary in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brualdi and Li introduced tournament interchange graphs. In such a graph, each vertex represents a tournament. Traversing an edge corresponds to reversing a cyclically directed triangle. Such a triangle is neutral, in that its reversal does not affect the score sequence. An interchange graph encodes the combinatorics of the set of tournaments with a given score sequence, or equivalently, of a given fiber of the classical permutahedron from discrete geometry.
  Coxeter tournaments were introduced by the first author and Sanchez, in relation to the Coxeter permutahedra in Ardila, Castillo, Eur and Postnikov. Coxeter tournaments have collaborative and solitaire games, in addition to the usual competitive games in classical tournaments.
  We introduce Coxeter interchange graphs. These graphs are more intricate, as there are multiple neutral structures at play, which interact with one another. Our main result shows that the Coxeter interchange graphs are regular, and we describe the degree geometrically, in terms of distances in the Coxeter permutahedra. We also characterize the set of score sequences of Coxeter tournaments, generalizing a classical result of Landau.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and $L(G)$ the set of all integers $k$ such that $G$ contains a spanning tree with exactly $k$ leaves. We show that for a connected graph $G$, the set $L(G)$ is contiguous. It follows from work of Chen, Ren, and Shan that every connected and locally connected $n$-vertex graph -- this includes triangulations -- has a spanning tree with at least $n/2 + 1$ leaves, so by a classic theorem of Whitney and our result, in any plane $4$-connected $n$-vertex triangulation one can find for any integer $k$ which is at least $2$ and at most $n/2 + 1$ a spanning tree with exactly $k$ leaves (and each of these trees can be constructed in polynomial time). We also prove that there exist infinitely many $n$ such that there is a plane $4$-connected $n$-vertex triangulation containing a spanning tree with $2n/3$ leaves, but no spanning tree with more than $2n/3$ leaves.</description>

      <title>Vertex-critical graphs in co-gem-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-vertex-critical if $\chi(G)=k$ but $\chi(G-v)&lt;k$ for all $v\in V(G)$ and $(G,H)$-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $G$ or $H$. We show that there are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ when $H$ is any graph of order $4$ by showing finiteness in the three remaining open cases, those are the cases when $H$ is $2P_2$, $K_3+P_1$, and $K_4$. For the first two cases we actually prove the stronger results:
  $\bullet$ There are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, paw$+P_1$)-free graphs for all $k$ and that only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, paw$+P_1$)-free graphs for all $k\ge 1$.
  $\bullet$ There are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, $P_5$, $P_3+cP_2$)-free graphs for all $k\ge 1$ and $c\ge 0$.
  To prove the latter result, we employ a novel application of Sperner's Theorem on the number of antichains in a partially ordered set. Our result for $K_4$ uses exhaustive computer search and is proved by showing the stronger result that every $(\text{co-gem, }K_4)$-free graph is $4$-colourable. Our results imply the existence of simple polynomial-time certifying algorithms to decide the $k$-colourability of (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ and all $H$ of order $4$ by searching the vertex-critical graphs as induced subgraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new expressions for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers, say $F_k(n)$. They satisfy the recurrence $F_k(n) = F_k(n-1) +\dots+F_k(n-k)$. Explicit expressions for the roots of the auxiliary (or characteristic) polynomial are presented, using Fuss-Catalan numbers. Properties of the roots are enumerated. We quantify the accuracy of asymptotic approximations for $F_k(n)$ for $n\gg1$. Our results subsume and extend some results published by previous authors. We also comment on the use of multinomial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers and related sequences. We also employ the generating function to express $F_k(n)$ as a concise (non-nested) sum of binomial coefficients for arbitrary $k$. Finally, we present a basis (or `fundamental solutions') to solve the above recurrence for arbitrary initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s Theorem from 1974 shows that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph with minimum degree greater than $2n/5$ must be bipartite. Its extensions to $3$-uniform hypergraphs without the generalized triangle $F_5 = \{abc, abd, cde\}$ have been explored in several previous works such as~\cite{LMR23unif,HLZ24}, demonstrating the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that for large $n$, every $n$-vertex $F_5$-free $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $(1/9-\varepsilon) n^2$ must be $3$-partite.
  We determine the optimal value for $\varepsilon$ by showing that for $n \ge 5000$, every $n$-vertex $F_5$-free $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $4n^2/45$ must be $3$-partite, thus establishing the first tight Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type theorem for hypergraphs. As a corollary, for all positive $n$, every $n$-vertex cancellative $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $4n^2/45$ must be $3$-partite. This result is also optimal and considerably strengthens prior work, such as that by Bollob\'{a}s~\cite{Bol74} and Keevash--Mubayi~\cite{KM04Cancel}.</description>

Abstract: Much recent literature concerns finiteness properties of infinite-dimensional algebraic varieties equipped with an action of the infinite symmetric group, or of the infinite general linear group. In this paper, we study a common generalisation in which the product of both groups acts on infinite-dimensional spaces, and we show that these spaces are topologically Noetherian with respect to this action.</description>

Abstract: This is a book on higher-categorical diagrams, including pasting diagrams. It aims to provide a thorough and modern reference on the subject, collecting, revisiting and expanding results scattered across the literature, informed by recent advances and practical experience with higher-dimensional diagram rewriting.
  We approach the subject as a kind of directed combinatorial topology: a diagram is a map from a "directed cell complex", encoded combinatorially as a face poset together with orientation data. Unlike previous expositions, we adopt from the beginning a functorial viewpoint, focussing on morphisms and categorical constructions. We do not tie ourselves to a specific model of higher categories, and instead treat diagrams as independent combinatorial structures that admit functorial interpretations in various contexts.
  Topics covered include the theory of layerings of diagrams; acyclicity properties and their consequences; constructions including Gray products, suspensions, and joins; special shapes such as globes, oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes; the interpretation of diagrams in strict omega-categories and their geometric realisation as simplicial and CW complexes; and Steiner's theory of directed chain complexes.</description>
