      <title>Stable deformed $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ homology of torus knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $E_2$ page in the Rasmussen spectral sequence from triply graded to $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ Khovanov--Rozansky stable homology of torus knots. This confirms a weak form of the conjecture of the second author, Oblomkov, and Rasmussen. The main tool is the link-splitting deformation, or $y$-ification, of link homology; in the $y$-ified context, the relevant Rasmussen spectral sequence collapses and we explicitly compute the $y$-ified $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ stable Khovanov--Rozansky homology of torus knots for all $N$.</description>

      <title>Simply slicing knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simply-connected 4-manifold with boundary the 3-sphere, this paper establishes sufficient conditions for a knot in the boundary to be sliced by a locally flat disc in the 4-manifold, whose complement has finite cyclic fundamental group. In addition, necessary and sufficient conditions are described to ensure that such discs exist stably, that is after taking the connected sum of the 4-manifold with copies of $S^2 \times S^2$.</description>

      <title>A Lefschetz decomposition over $\mathbb Z$, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a 'Lefschetz filtration' of $\Lambda^*(\mathbb Z^{2g})$ and prove its subquotients are isomorphic as $\text{Sp}(2g)$-modules to primitive subspaces $P^k(\mathbb Z^{2g})$. This gives a sort of integral version of the Lefschetz decomposition over $\mathbb C$.
  We present three applications: the precise failure of the Hard Lefschetz theorem for $\Lambda^*(\mathbb Z^{2g})$, a description of the $\text{Sp}(2g)$-module structure on the cohomology of integer Heisenberg groups, and a computation of the Heegaard Floer homology groups $HF^\infty(\Sigma_g \times S^1; \mathbb Z)$ as modules over the mapping class group. Our computation implies that $HF^\infty$ is not naturally isomorphic to Mark's 'cup homology'.</description>

      <title>Danceability of twisted virtual knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, several Bridges papers have delved into the concept of danceability of a knot diagram. Inspired by dancing on non-orientable surfaces, in this paper, we expand danceability to twisted virtual knot diagrams. This paper is accompanied by a Math-Dance video which can be found at https://youtu.be/G4u2xMK-fxU.</description>

      <title>New types of convergence for unbounded star-shaped sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce radial variants of the Wijsman and Attouch-Wets topologies for the family $\mathcal{S}_{rc}^d$ of star sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that are radially closed.These topologies give rise to new types of convergence for star-shaped sets with respect to the origin, even when such sets are not closed or bounded. Our approach relies on a new family of functionals, called \textit{radial distance functionals}, which measure ``radial distances'' between points $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and sets $A \in \mathcal{S}_{rc}^d$. These are natural radial analogues of the classical distance functionals. We prove that our radial Wijsman type topology $\tau_{W^r}$ is not metrizable on $\mathcal{S}_{rc}^d$, while our radial Attouch-Wets type topology $\tau_{AW^r}$ is completely metrizable. A corresponding radial Attouch-Wets distance $d_{AW^r}$ is introduced, and we prove that $d_{AW}(A,K) \leq d_{AW^r}(A,K)$ for all closed $A,K \in \mathcal{S}_{rc}^d$, where $d_{AW}$ denotes the Attouch-Wets distance. Among others, these results are applied to prove the continuity of the star duality on $\mathcal{S}_{rc}^d$ with respect to both $\tau_{W^r}$ and $\tau_{AW^r}$, and to establish topological properties of the family of flowers associated with closed convex sets containing the origin.</description>

      <title>Density of integral points in the Betti moduli of quasi-projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a smooth quasi-projective complex variety equipped with a simple normal crossings compactification. We show that integral points are potentially dense in the (relative) character varieties parametrizing $SL_2$-local systems on $Y$ with fixed algebraic integer traces along the boundary components. The proof proceeds by using work of Corlette-Simpson to reduce to the case of Riemann surfaces, where we produce an integral point with Zariski-dense orbit under the mapping class group.</description>

      <title>Continuous Noncrossing Partitions and Weighted Circular Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article examines noncrossing partitions of the unit circle in the complex plane; we call these continuous noncrossing partitions. More precisely, we focus on the degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions where unit complex numbers in the same block have identical $d$-th powers. We prove that the degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions form a topological poset whose uncountable set of elements can be indexed by equivalence classes of objects we call weighted linear factorizations of factors of a $d$-cycle. Moreover, the maximal elements in this poset form a subspace homeomorphic to the dual Garside classifying space for the $d$-strand braid group.
  The degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions of the unit circle are a special case of a more general construction. For every choice of Coxeter element $c$ in any Coxeter group $W$ we define a topological poset of equivalence classes of weighted linear factorizations of factors of $c$ in $W$ whose elements we call continuous $c$-noncrossing partitions. The maximal elements in this poset form a subspace homeomorphic to the one-vertex complex whose fundamental group is the corresponding dual Artin group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1009.5716v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider compact, aspherical solenoids obtained as the inverse limit of a system of CW~complexes and covering maps. This includes $P$-adic solenoids, as well as the universal hyperbolic solenoid of Teichm\"{u}ller theory. Using ideas from shape theory, we classify maps between such solenoids up to homotopy, and we prove a Dehn-Nielsen-type theorem for self-homotopy equivalences of such a solenoid. This generalizes a result of Odden regarding the universal hyperbolic solenoid.</description>

      <title>Fundamental $n$-quandles of links are residually finite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the residual finiteness and subquandle separability of quandles, properties that respectively imply the solvability of the word problem and the generalized word problem for quandles. From Winker's work, we know that fundamental $n$-quandles of oriented links, which are canonical quotients of their fundamental quandles, are closely associated with $n$-fold cyclic branched covers of the 3-sphere branched over these links. We prove that the fundamental $n$-quandle of any oriented link in the 3-sphere is residually finite for each $n\ge 2$. This supplements the recent result by Bardakov, Singh and the third author on residual finiteness of fundamental quandles of oriented links, and the classification by Hoste and Shanahan of links whose fundamental $n$-quandles are finite for some $n$. We also establish several general results on these finiteness properties and identify many families of quandles admitting them.</description>

      <title>On Round Surgery Diagrams For 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of round surgery diagrams in $S^3$ for representing 3-manifolds similar to Dehn surgery diagrams. We give a correspondence between a certain class of round surgery diagrams and Dehn surgery diagrams for 3-manifolds. As a consequence, we recover Asimov's result, stating that any closed connected oriented 3-manifold can be obtained by a round surgery on a framed link in $S^3$. There may be more than one round surgery diagram giving rise to the same 3-manifold. Thus, it is natural to ask whether there is a version of Kirby Calculus for round surgery diagrams, similar to the case of Dehn surgery diagrams with integral framings. In this direction, we define four types of moves on round surgery diagrams such that any two round surgery diagrams corresponding to the same 3-manifold can be obtained one from another by a finite sequence of these moves, thereby establishing a version of Kirby Calculus. As an application, we prove the existence of taut foliations, hence the existence of tight contact structures on 3-manifolds obtained by round 1-surgery on fibred links with two components on $S^3$.</description>

      <title>An Invariant for Triple-Point-Free Immersed Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an invariant of triple-point-free immersions of $2$-spheres into Euclidean $3$-space, taking values in $l^1(\mathbb{Z})$. It remains unchanged under regular homotopies through such immersions. An explicit description of its image shows that the space of triple-point-free immersed spheres has infinitely many regular homotopy classes. Consequently, many pairs of immersed spheres can only be connected by regular homotopies that pass through triple points. We represent the double points of a triple-point-free immersed sphere using a directed tree, equipped with a pair relation on the edges and an integer-valued function on the vertices. The invariant depends on this function and on the vertex indegrees.</description>

      <title>On Contact Round Surgeries on $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{st})$ and Their Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of contact round surgery of index 1 and 2, respectively, on Legendrian knots in $\left(\mathbb{S}^3, \xi_{st}\right)$ and associate diagrams to them. We realize Jiro Adachi's contact round surgeries as special cases. We show that every closed connected contact 3-manifold can be obtained by performing a sequence of contact round surgeries on some Legendrian link in $\left(\mathbb{S}^3, \xi_{st}\right)$, thus obtaining a contact round surgery diagram for each contact 3-manifold. This is analogous to a similar result of Ding and Geiges for contact Dehn surgeries. We discuss a bridge between certain pairs of contact round surgery diagrams of index 1 and 2 and contact $\pm1$-surgery diagrams. We use this bridge to establish the result mentioned above.</description>

      <title>A general construction of simultaneously hyperbolic elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an explicit construction of simultaneously hyperbolic elements in a group acting on finitely many Gromov-hyperbolic spaces under the weakest conditions. This essentially generalizes results of Clay-Uyanik in \cite{CU18}, of Genevois in \cite{Gen19}, and of Balasubramanya-Fern\'{o}s in \cite{BF24}. Besides, we show that the set of simultaneously hyperbolic elements has strictly positive density with respect to any proper word metric under the weakest conditions. This recovers many classical counting results, eg. the main result of Wiest in \cite{Wie17}.
  As an important ingredient in the proof of main results, we show that the set of simultaneously contracting elements in a group acting on finitely many metric spaces with contracting property has strictly positive density with respect to any proper word metric. This generalizes two results of Wan-Xu-Yang in \cite{WXY24} and of Balasubramanya-Fern\'{o}s in \cite{BF24}.</description>
