      <title>Optimisation of Gyrokinetic Microstability Using Adjoint Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microinstabilities drive turbulent fluctuations in inhomogeneous, magnetized plasmas. In the context of magnetic confinement fusion devices, this leads to an enhanced transport of particles, momentum, and energy, thereby degrading confinement. In this work, we elaborate on the application of the adjoint method to efficiently determine the variation of linear growth rates for plasma microstabilities concerning a general set of external parameters within the local $\delta \! f$-gyrokinetic model. We then offer numerical verification of this approach. When coupled with gradient-based techniques, this methodology can facilitate the optimization process for the microstability of the confined plasmas across a high-dimensional parameter space. We present a numerical demonstration wherein the ion-temperature gradient (ITG) instability growth rate in a tokamak plasma is minimized with respect to flux surface shaping parameters. The adjoint method approach demonstrates a significant computational speed-up compared to a finite-difference gradient calculation.</description>

      <title>Growth of metal catalyst nanoparticles in hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere of arc discharge for synthesis of carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct current (DC) arc discharge is a widely used method for industrial-scale production of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). A high-selectivity synthesis of SWCNT requires ultra-fine, typically a few nanometers in diameter, catalyst particles, which is challenging to achieve in harsh arc environments involving high temperatures, ablation of electrode materials, convection, and instabilities. Here, we explore how the size of metal catalyst nanoparticles is affected by a hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere of the DC arc. In this arc, iron nanoparticles are produced by the evaporation of an anode, made from low-carbon steel. Methane admixture into argon gas serves as a carbon source. Electron microscopy and elemental analysis suggest that hydrocarbons decompose on iron clusters forming a carbon shell, which limits further iron particle growth. Experimental observations are explained using an aerosol growth model. The results demonstrate the potential to manipulate the catalyst particle size in hydrocarbon arc environments.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional inference of divertor plasma characteristics: advancements to a multi-instrument Bayesian analysis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrated data analysis system based on Bayesian inference has been developed for application to data from multiple diagnostics over the two-dimensional cross-section of tokamak divertors. Tests of the divertor multi-instrument Bayesian analysis system (D-MIBAS) on a synthetic data set (including realistic experimental uncertainties) generated from SOLPS-ITER predictions of the MAST-U divertor have been performed. The resulting inference was within 6\%, 5\% and 30\% median absolute percentage error of the SOLPS-predicted electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density, respectively, across a two-dimensional poloidal cross-section of the MAST-U Super-X outer divertor.
  To accommodate molecular contributions to Balmer emission, an advanced emission model has been developed which is shown to be crucial for inference accuracy. Our D-MIBAS system utilises a mesh aligned to poloidal magnetic flux-surfaces, throughout the divertor, with plasma parameters assigned to each mesh vertex and collectively considered in the inference. This allowed comprehensive forward models to multiple diagnostics and the inclusion of expected physics. This is shown to be important for inference precision when including molecular contributions to Balmer emission. These developments pave the way for accurate two-dimensional electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density inferences for MAST-U divertor experimental data for the first time.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh Taylor Instability in Multiple Finite-Thickness Fluid Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general transfer-matrix formalism for determining the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a fluid system with spatially varying density and viscosity. We use this formalism to analytically and numerically treat the case of a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We introduce the inviscid-flow approximation in our transfer-matrix formalism to find analytic solutions in the limit of uniform kinematic viscosity for a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We discuss the applicability of these results and the no-acceleration approximation that also yields analytical solutions in the large viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Formation of Polar Crown Filaments Magnetic Fields by Supergranular Helicity Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the magnetic fields of the polar crown filaments (PCFs) at high latitudes near polar regions of the Sun, we perform magnetofrictional numerical simulations on the long-term magnetic evolution of bipolar fields with roughly east-west polarity inversion lines (PILs) in a three-dimensional (3D) spherical wedge domain near polar regions. The Coriolis effect induced vortical motions at the boundaries of several supergranular cells inject magnetic helicity from the photospheric boundary into the solar atmosphere. Supergranular-scale helicity injection, transfer, and condensation produce strongly sheared magnetic fields. Magnetic reconnections at footpoints of the sheared fields produce magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) with helicity signs consistent with the observed Hemispheric Helicity Rule (HHR). The cross-sectional area of MFRs exhibits an uneven distribution, resembling a "foot-node-foot" periodic configuration. Experiments with different tilt directions of PILs indicate that the PCFs preferably form along PILs with the western end close to the polar region. The bending of PILs caused by supergranular flows, forming S-shape (Z-shape) PIL segments, promotes the formation of dextral (sinistral) MFRs. The realistic magnetic models we got can serve as starting points for the study of the plasma formation and eruption of PCFs.</description>

      <title>Plasma motions in the solar corona and solar wind to 1 au, as inferred from radio wave scattering observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio signals propagating via the solar corona and solar wind are significantly affected by compressive waves, impacting solar burst properties as well as sources viewed through the turbulent atmosphere. While static fluctuations scatter radio waves elastically, moving, turbulent or oscillating density irregularities act to broaden the frequency of the scattered waves. Using a new anisotropic density fluctuation model based on solar radio bursts, we deduce the plasma velocities required to explain observations of spacecraft signal frequency broadening. The frequency broadening is consistent with motions that are dominated by the solar wind at distances $\gtrsim 10$ $R_\odot$, but the levels of frequency broadening for $\lesssim 10$ $R_\odot$ require additional radial speeds $\sim (100-300)$ km s$^{-1}$ and/or transverse speeds $\sim (20-70)$ km s$^{-1}$. The inferred radial velocities appear consistent with the sound or proton thermal speeds, while the speeds perpendicular to the radial direction are consistent with non-thermal motions measured via coronal Doppler-line broadening, interpreted as Alfv\'enic fluctuations. Landau damping of parallel propagating ion-sound (slow MHD) waves allow an estimate of the proton heating rate. The energy deposition rates due to ion-sound wave damping peak at a heliocentric distance of $\sim(1-3)$ $R_\odot$ are comparable to the rates available from a turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic waves at large scales, suggesting a coherent picture of energy transfer, via the cascade or/and parametric decay of Alfv\'en waves to the small scales where heating takes place.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Contributions to the Turbulent Cascade in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present evidence for nonlocal contributions to the turbulent energy cascade in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasmas. Therefore, we revisit a well-known result derived directly from the MHD equations, i.e., the Politano and Pouquet (P&amp;P) law for the transfer of kinetic and magnetic energy in scale. We propose adding a term that accounts for nonlocal transfer and represents the influence of fluctuations from large scales due to the Alfv\'en effect. Supported by direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic MHD turbulence, we verify that in some plasma configurations, neglecting the additional nonlocal term might consistently overestimate energy dissipation rates and, thus, the contributions of turbulent energy dissipation potentially affecting solar wind heating; a central puzzle in space plasma physics that motivates the present work.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for the hydrodynamics of the classical one-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic equations for a one-component plasma are derived as a generalization of the Euler equations to include the effects of the long-range Coulomb interaction. By using a variational principle, these equations self-consistently unify thermodynamics, dispersion laws, nonlinear motion, and conservation laws. In the moderate and strong coupling limits, it is argued that these equations work down to the length scale of the average interparticle spacing. Closure and self-consistency of these nonlocal equations are achieved via the implementation of a variational principle. Hydrodynamic equations are evaluated in both the Eulerian frame, where the dependent variables depend on the position in the laboratory, and the Lagrangian frame, where they depend on the position in some reference state, such as the initial position. Each frame has its advantages and our final theory combines elements of both. The properties of longitudinal and transverse dispersion laws are calculated for the hydrodynamic equations. A simple step function approximation for the pair distribution function is used that allows for simple calculations that reveal the structure of the equations of motion. The obtained dispersion laws are compared to molecular dynamics simulations and the theory of quasilocalized charge approximation. The action, which gives excellent agreement for both longitudinal and transverse dispersion laws for a wide range of coupling strengths, is elucidated. Agreement with numerical experiments shows that such a hydrodynamic approach can be used to accurately describe a one-component plasma at very small length scales comparable to the average interparticle spacing. The validity of this approach suggests considering nonlinear flows and other systems with long-range interactions in the future.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Deep Learning Description of Knudsen Layer Reactivity Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is used to evaluate the fast ion distribution in the hot spot of an inertial confinement fusion target. The use of tailored input and output layers to the neural network is shown to enable a PINN to learn the parametric solution to the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation in the absence of any synthetic or experimental data. As an explicit demonstration of the approach, the specific problem of Knudsen layer fusion yield reduction is treated. Here, predictions from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck PINN are used to provide a non-perturbative solution of the fast ion tail in the vicinity of the hot spot thus allowing the spatial profile of the fusion reactivity to be evaluated for a range of collisionalities and hot spot conditions. Excellent agreement is found between the predictions of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck PINN and results from traditional numerical solvers with respect to both the energy and spatial distribution of fast ions and the fusion reactivity profile demonstrating that the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck PINN provides an accurate and efficient means of determining the impact of Knudsen layer yield reduction across a broad range of plasma conditions.</description>
