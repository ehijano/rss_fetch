      <title>Prioritizing High-Precision Photometric Monitoring of Exoplanet and Brown Dwarf Companions with JWST -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advocate for the prioritization of high-precision photometric monitoring of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions to detect brightness variability arising from features in their atmospheres. Measurements of photometric variability provide not only an insight into the physical appearances of these companions, but are also a direct probe of their atmospheric structures and dynamics, and yield valuable estimates of their rotation periods. JWST is uniquely capable of monitoring faint exoplanet companions over their full rotation periods, thanks to its inherent stability and powerful high-contrast coronagraphic imaging modes. Rotation period measurements can be further combined with measurements of v sin i obtained using high-resolution spectroscopy to infer the viewing angle of a companion. Photometric monitoring over multiple rotation periods and at multiple epochs will allow both short- and long-term time evolution in variability signals to be traced. Furthermore, the differences between the layers in a companion's atmosphere can be probed by obtaining simultaneous photometric monitoring at different wavelengths through NIRCam dual-band coronagraphy. Overall, JWST will reach the highest sensitivities to variability to date and enable the light curves of substellar companions to be characterised with unprecedented cadence and precision at the sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>PINT: Maximum-likelihood estimation of pulsar timing noise parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PINT is a pure-Python framework for high-precision pulsar timing developed on top of widely used and well-tested Python libraries, supporting both interactive and programmatic data analysis workflows. We present a new frequentist framework within PINT to characterize the single-pulsar noise processes present in pulsar timing datasets. This framework enables the parameter estimation for both uncorrelated and correlated noise processes as well as the model comparison between different timing and noise models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new framework by applying it to simulated datasets as well as a real dataset of PSR B1855+09. We also briefly describe the new features implemented in PINT since it was first described in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The great development of astrometric accuracy since the observations by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus about 150 BC has often been displayed in diagrams showing the accuracy versus time. Two new diagrams are provided here, one for positions only, another including parallaxes. New information is included on the Gaia DR3 data and the coming data releases, and about two great astronomers from the distant past, Wilhelm in Kassel and al-Sufi in Isfahan.</description>

      <title>Estimating microlensing parameters from observables and stellar isochrones with pyLIMASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present pyLIMASS, a novel algorithm for estimating the physical properties of the lensing system in microlensing events. The main idea of pyLIMASS is to combine all available information regarding the microlensing event, defined as observables, and to estimate the parameter distributions of the system, such as the lens mass and distance. The algorithm is based on isochrones for the stars model and combine the observables using a Gaussian Mixtures approach. After describing the mathematical formalism and its implementation, we discuss the algorithm's performance on simulated and published events. Generally, the pyLIMASS estimations are in good agreement (i.e., within 1-$\sigma$) with the results of the selected published events, making it an effective tool to estimate the lens properties and their distribution. The applicability of the method was tested by using a catalog of realistically simulated events that could be observed by the future Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By solely using constraints from the Roman lightcurves and images, pyLIMASS estimates the masses of the lens of the Roman catalog with a median precision of 20% with almost no bias.</description>

      <title>Polish Astrophysics: The First Half-Century, 1923-1973</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An attempt is made to evaluate progress of the Polish astrophysical research of stars and of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) on the basis of scientific paper citations in the ADS database. Rather modest citation levels were observed in the years before the mid-1950's. In the years 1958 - 1973, thanks to the partly opened foreign contacts and to strong support from astronomers of the older generation, work of a number of young, energetic enthusiasts reached the world science levels and formed a strong basis for the well recognized, international successes of the next generations.</description>

      <title>SAUNAS I: Searching for Low Surface Brightness X-ray Emission with Chandra/ACIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SAUNAS (Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal), a pipeline designed for detecting diffuse X-ray emission in the data obtained with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. SAUNAS queries the available observations in the Chandra archive, performs photometric calibration, PSF (point spread function) modeling, and deconvolution, point-source removal, adaptive smoothing, and background correction. This pipeline builds on existing and well-tested software including CIAO, VorBin, and LIRA. We characterize the performance of SAUNAS through several quality performance tests, and demonstrate the broad applications and capabilities of SAUNAS using two galaxies already known to show X-ray emitting structures. SAUNAS successfully detects the 30 kpc X-ray super-wind of NGC 3079 using Chandra/ACIS datasets, matching the spatial distribution detected with more sensitive XMM-Newton observations. The analysis performed by SAUNAS reveals an extended low surface brightness source in the field of UGC 5101 in the 0.3-1.0 keV and 1.0-2.0 keV bands. This source is potentially a background galaxy cluster or a hot gas plume associated with UGC 5101. SAUNAS demonstrates its ability to recover previously undetected structures in archival data, expanding exploration into the low surface brightness X-ray universe with Chandra/ACIS.</description>

      <title>Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2024. Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second "Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter" (MDvDM'24) meeting was held January 8-11, 2024 in Arlington, VA, USA, hosted by Virginia Tech's Center for Neutrino Physics. This document collects contributions from this workshop, providing an overview of activities in the field. MDvDM'24 was the second topical workshop dedicated to the emerging field of mineral detection of neutrinos and dark matter, following a meeting hosted by IFPU in Trieste, Italy in October 2022. Mineral detectors have been proposed for a wide variety of applications, including searching for dark matter, measuring various fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos over gigayear timescales, monitoring nuclear reactors, and nuclear disarmament protocols; both as paleo-detectors using natural minerals that could have recorded the traces of nuclear recoils for timescales as long as a billion years and as detectors recording nuclear recoil events on laboratory timescales using natural or artificial minerals. Contributions to this proceedings discuss the vast physics potential, the progress in experimental studies, and the numerous challenges lying ahead on the path towards mineral detection. These include a better understanding of the formation and annealing of recoil defects in crystals; identifying the best classes of minerals and, for paleo-detectors, understanding their geology; modeling and control of the relevant backgrounds; developing, combining, and scaling up imaging and data analysis techniques; and many others. During the last years, MDvDM has grown rapidly and gained attention. Small-scale experimental efforts focused on establishing various microscopic readout techniques are underway at institutions in North America, Europe and Asia. We are looking ahead to an exciting future full of challenges to overcome, surprises to be encountered, and discoveries lying ahead of us.</description>

      <title>Direct detectability of tidally heated exomoons by photometric orbital modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Aims) We investigate whether volcanic exomoons can be detected in thermal wavelength light curves due to their phase variability along their orbit. The method we use is based on the photometric signal variability that volcanic features or hotspots would cause in infrared (IR) wavelengths, when they are inhomogeneously distributed on the surface of a tidally heated exomoon (THEM). (Methods) We simulated satellites of various sizes around an isolated planet and modeled the system's variability in two IR wavelengths, taking into account photon shot noise. The moon's periodic signal as it orbits the planet introduces a peak in the frequency space of the system's time-variable flux. We investigated the THEM and system properties that would make a moon stand out in the frequency space of its host's variable flux. (Results) The moon's signal can produce a prominent feature in its host's flux periodogram at shorter IR wavelengths for hotspots with temperatures similar to the ones seen on the Jovian moon, Io, while the same moon would not be identifiable in longer IR wavelengths. By comparing observations at two different wavelengths, we are able to disentangle an exomoon's signal from the planet's one in the frequency domain for system distances up to $\sim$10 pc for Mars-sized exomoons and even further for Earth-sized ones for transiting and non-transiting orbital inclinations. (Conclusions) This method enlarges the parameter space of detectable exomoons around isolated planetary mass objects and directly imaged exoplanets, as it is sensitive to Io-Earth sized exomoons with hot volcanic features for a wide range of non-transiting orbital inclinations. Exomoon transits and the detection of outgassed volcanic molecules can subsequently confirm a putative detection.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the mid-infrared spectra of galaxies using ultraviolet to submillimeter photometry and Deep Generative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mid-infrared spectra of galaxies are rich in features such as the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) and silicate dust features which give valuable information about the physics of galaxies and their evolution. For example they can provide information about the relative contribution of star formation and accretion from a supermassive black hole to the power output of galaxies. However, the mid-infrared spectra are currently available for a very small fraction of galaxies that have been detected in deep multi-wavelength surveys of the sky. In this paper we explore whether Deep Generative Network methods can be used to reconstruct mid-infrared spectra in the 5-35{\mu}m range using the limited multi-wavelength photometry in ~20 bands from the ultraviolet to the submillimeter which is typically available in extragalactic surveys. For this purpose we use simulated spectra computed with a combination of radiative transfer models for starbursts, active galactic nucleus (AGN) tori and host galaxies. We find that our method using Deep Generative Networks, namely Generative Adversarial Networks and Generative Latent Optimization models, can efficiently produce high quality reconstructions of mid-infrared spectra in ~70% of the cases.</description>

      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>

      <title>Impact of half-wave plate systematics on the measurement of CMB $B$-mode polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can help probe the fundamental physics behind cosmic inflation via the measurement of primordial $B$ modes. As this requires exquisite control over instrumental systematics, some next-generation CMB experiments plan to use a rotating half-wave plate (HWP) as polarization modulator. However, the HWP non-idealities, if not properly treated in the analysis, can result in additional systematics. In this paper, we present a simple, semi-analytical end-to-end model to propagate the HWP non-idealities through the macro-steps that make up any CMB experiment (observation of multi-frequency maps, foreground cleaning, and power spectra estimation) and compute the HWP-induced bias on the estimated tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. We find that the effective polarization efficiency of the HWP suppresses the polarization signal, leading to an underestimation of $r$. Laboratory measurements of the properties of the HWP can be used to calibrate this effect, but we show how gain calibration of the CMB temperature can also be used to partially mitigate it. On the basis of our findings, we present a set of recommendations for the HWP design that can help maximize the benefits of gain calibration.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometry, the precise measurement of star motions, offers an alternative avenue to investigate low-frequency gravitational waves through the spatial deflection of photons, complementing pulsar timing arrays reliant on timing residuals. Upcoming data from Gaia and Roman can not only cross-check pulsar timing array findings but also explore the uncharted frequency range bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA. We present an analytical framework to evaluate the feasibility of detecting a gravitational wave background, considering measurement noise and the intrinsic variability of the stochastic background. Furthermore, we highlight astrometry's crucial role in uncovering key properties of the gravitational wave background, such as spectral index and chirality, employing information-matrix analysis. Finally, we simulate the emergence of quadrupolar correlations, commonly referred to as the generalized Hellings-Downs curves.</description>

      <title>QRIS: A Quantitative Reflectance Imaging System for the Pristine Sample of Asteroid Bennu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantitative Reflectance Imaging System (QRIS) is a laboratory-based spectral imaging system constructed to image the sample of asteroid Bennu delivered to Earth by the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft. The system was installed in the OSIRIS-REx cleanroom at NASA's Johnson Space Center to collect data during preliminary examination of the Bennu sample. QRIS uses a 12-bit machine vision camera to measure reflectance over wavelength bands spanning the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Raw data are processed by a calibration pipeline that generates a series of monochromatic, high-dynamic-range reflectance images, as well as band ratio maps, band depth maps, and 3-channel color images. The purpose of these spectral reflectance data is to help characterize lithologies in the sample and compare them to lithologies observed on Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. This initial assessment of lithological diversity was intended to help select the subsamples that will be used to address mission science questions about the early solar system and the origins of life and to provide important context for the selection of representative subsamples for preservation and distribution to international partners. When QRIS imaged the Bennu sample, unexpected calibration issues arose that had not been evident at imaging rehearsals and negatively impacted the quality of QRIS data. These issues were caused by stray light within the lens and reflections off the glovebox window and interior, and were exacerbated by the sample's extremely low reflectance. QRIS data were useful for confirming conclusions drawn from other data, but reflectance and spectral data from QRIS alone unfortunately have limited utility.</description>
