      <title>Thermodynamics and Legendre Duality in Optimal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimality principles in nonequilibrium transport networks are linked to a thermodynamic formalism based on generalized transport potentials endowed with Legendre duality and related contact structure. This allows quantifying the distance from non-equilibrium operating points, analogously to thermodynamic availability as well as to shed light on optimality principles in relation to different imposed constraints. Extremizations of generalized dissipation and entropy production appear as special cases that require power-law resistances and -- for entropy production -- also isothermal conditions. Changes in stability of multiple operating points are interpreted as phase transitions based on non-equilibrium equations of state, while cost-based optimization of transport properties reveals connections to the generalized dissipation in the case of power law costs and linear resistance law, but now with typically unstable operating points which give rise to branched optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Two Types of Temporal Symmetry in the Laws of Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the implications of assuming time symmetry and applying bridge-type, time-symmetric temporal boundary conditions to deterministic laws of nature with random components. The analysis, drawing on the works of Kolmogorov and Anderson, leads to two forms of governing equations, referred to here as symmetric and antisymmetric. These equations account for the emergence of characteristics associated with conventional thermodynamics, the arrow of time, and a form of antecedent causality. The directional properties of time arise from the mathematical structure of Markov bridges, without requiring any postulates that impose a preferred direction of time.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the thermodynamic limit in quantum spin and dimer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Statistics in the Kicked Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kicked Ising model has been studied extensively as a model of quantum chaos. Bertini, Kos, and Prosen studied the system in the thermodynamic limit, finding an analytic expression for the spectral form factor, $K(t)$, at the self-dual point with periodic boundary conditions. The spectral form factor is the 2nd moment of the trace of the time evolution operator, and we study the higher moments of this random variable in the kicked Ising model. A previous study of these higher moments by Flack, Bertini, and Prosen showed that, surprisingly, the trace behaves like a real Gaussian random variable when the system has periodic boundary conditions at the self dual point. By contrast, we investigate the model with open boundary conditions at the self dual point and find that the trace of the time evolution operator behaves as a complex Gaussian random variable as expected from random matrix universality based on the circular orthogonal ensemble. This result highlights a surprisingly strong effect of boundary conditions on the statistics of the trace. We also study a generalization of the spectral form factor known as the Loschmidt spectral form factor and present results for different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Unifying renormalized and bare viscosity in two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field, as a finite-wavevector extension of the Green--Kubo formula. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note addresses the relevance of rare events in system dynamics, inspired by Jill North reflections on the origin of the arrow of time in thermodynamics. After identifying the existence of rare events, characterized by a Pareto distribution, within a simple gas particle simulation, we investigate their impact on entropy evolution. These rare events are associated with microstates that locally decrease entropy, in contrast to the overall entropy increase observed in the bulk of the system. We present numerical simulations of gas particles, both without and with a gravity-like attractive force, to explore the fate of these rare events. Our results show that, while rare events can transiently generate local decreases in entropy, global entropy may continue to increase in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. The introduction of gravity-like attraction stabilizes these low-entropy configurations, allowing them to persist longer. This study highlights the interplay between rare statistical fluctuations and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior, providing new insights into the emergence and stability of order in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Validity of generalized Gibbs ensemble in a random matrix model with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is ubiquitous in quantum mechanical systems where it drives various phase transitions and emergent physics. To understand the role of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the thermalization of a local observable in a disordered system, we consider random symmetric centrosymmetric (SC) matrices where the exchange symmetry is conserved. Such a conservation law splits the Hilbert space into decoupled subspaces such that the energy spectrum of a SC matrix is a superposition of two pure spectra. After discussing the known results on the correlations of such mixed spectrum, we consider different initial states and analytically compute the entire time evolution of their survival probability and associated timescales. We show that there exist certain initial states which do not decay over a very long timescales such that a measure zero fraction of random SC matrices exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking. Later, we show that thermalization is violated for a generic local observable in case of the SC matrices, where the generalized Gibbs ensemble accurately captures the equilibrium expectation values.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (mic.SA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the mic.SA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>

      <title>Correcting systematic errors in the likelihood optimization of underdamped Langevin models of molecular dynamics trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Kramers' pioneering work in 1940, significant efforts have been devoted to studying Langevin equations applied to physical and chemical reactions projected onto few collective variables, with particular focus on the inference of their parameters. While the inference for overdamped Langevin equations is well-established and widely applied, a notable gap remains in the literature for underdamped Langevin equations, which incorporate inertial effects and velocities. This gap arises from the challenge of accessing velocities solely through finite differences of positions, resulting in spurious correlations. In this letter, we propose an analytical correction for these correlations, specifically designed for a likelihood-maximization algorithm that exploits short, non-ergodic trajectories that can be obtained at reasonable numerical cost. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are tested across a benchmark case and a realistic system. This work paves the way for applying generalized Langevin equation inference to chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Endoreversible Stirling cycles: plasma engines at maximal power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endoreversible engine cycles are a cornerstone of finite-time thermodynamics. We show that endoreversible Stirling engines operating with a one-component plasma as working medium run at maximal power output with the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. As a main result, we elucidate that this is actually a consequence of the fact that the caloric equation of state depends only linearly on temperature and only additively on volume. In particular, neither the exact form of the mechanical equation of state, nor the full fundamental relation are required. Thus, our findings immediately generalize to a larger class of working plasmas, far beyond simple ideal gases. In addition, we show that for plasmas described by the photonic equation of state the efficiency is significantly lower. This is in stark contrast to endoreversible Otto cycles, for which photonic engines have an efficiency larger than the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency.</description>

      <title>Method of canonical transformations in the theory of quantum gases interacting with radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach to the theoretical study of effects and phenomena in quantum gases interacting with radiation is proposed. The approach is based on a modification of the canonical transformation method, which was once used to diagonalize Hamiltonians describing the interaction of electrons with phonons in a solid. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by studying the influence of photons on the spectral characteristics of atoms of quantum gases interacting with radiation. Within the framework of the developed approach, the effect of "dressing" atoms of quantum gases by a cloud of virtual photons is investigated and expressions for the energy characteristics of such dressed atoms - quasiparticles are obtained. The problem of defining the concept of the effective mass of such quasiparticles is discussed.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Linking Free and Forced Fluctuations via Koopmanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between forced and free fluctuations for nonequilibrium systems can be described via a generalized version of the celebrated fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The use of the formalism of the Koopman operator makes it possible to deliver an intepretable form of the response operators written as a sum of exponentially decaying terms, each associated one-to-one with a mode of natural variability of the system. Here we showcase on a stochastically forced version of the celebrated Lorenz '63 model the feasibility and skill of such an approach by considering different Koopman dictionaries, which allows us to treat also seamlessly coarse-graining approaches like the Ulam method. Our findings provide support for the development of response theory-based investigation methods also in an equation-agnostic, data-driven environment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.</description>

      <title>Crystal Nucleation Kinetics and Mechanism: Influence of Interaction Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulating liquid-to-solid transitions and the resulting crystalline structure for tailored properties is much desired. Colloidal systems are exemplary to this end, but the fundamental knowledge gaps in relating the influence of intermolecular interactions to crystallization behavior continue to hinder progress. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by studying nucleation and growth in systems with modified Lennard-Jones potential. Specifically, we study the commonly used 12-6 potential and a softer 7-6 potential. The thermodynamic state point for the study is chosen such that both systems are investigated at the same level of supercooling and pressure. Under these conditions, we find that the nucleation rate for both systems is comparable. Interestingly, the nucleation pathways and resulting crystal structures are different. In the 12-6 system, nucleation and growth occur predominantly through the FCC structure. Softening the potential alters the critical nucleus composition and introduces two distinct nucleation pathways. One pathway predominantly leads to the nucleus with a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, while the other favors the face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangement. Our study illustrates that polymorph selection can be achieved through modifications to intermolecular interactions without impacting nucleation kinetics. The results have significant implications in designing approaches for polymorph selection and modulating self-assembly mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Mean-field and Monte Carlo Analysis of Multi-Species Dynamics of agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mean-field (MF) approximation for the recurrence relation governing the dynamics of $m$ species of particles on a square lattice, and we simultaneously perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under identical initial conditions to emulate the intricate motion observed in environments such as subway corridors and scramble crossings in large cities. Each species moves according to transition probabilities influenced by its respective static floor field and the state of neighboring cells. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze statistical fluctuations in the spatial distribution for $m = 1$, $m = 2$, and $m = 4$ and for different regimes of average density and biased movement. A numerical comparison is conducted to determine the best agreement between the MC simulations and the MF approximation considering a renormalization exponent $\beta$ that optimizes the fit between methods. Finally, we report a phenomenon we term "Gaussian-to-Gaussian" behavior, in which an initially normal distribution of particles becomes distorted due to interactions among same and opposing species, passes through a transient regime, and eventually returns to a Gaussian-like profile in the steady state, after multiple rounds of motion under periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of the Ising Model on a 3-Dimensional Fractal Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical behavior of the classical Ising model on a three-dimensional fractal lattice with Hausdorff dimension $d_H = \ln32 / \ln4 = 2.5$ is investigated using the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) method. We determine the critical temperature $T_c \approx 2.65231$ and the critical exponents for magnetization $\beta \approx 0.059$ and field response $\delta \approx 35$. Unlike a previously studied 2D fractal with $d_H \approx 1.792$, the specific heat for this 3D fractal exhibits a divergent singularity at $T_c$. The results are compared with those for regular lattices and other fractal structures to elucidate the role of dimensionality in critical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a procedure that enables us to calculate the excess free energies for a finite Ising cylinder with domain walls analytically. This procedure transparently covers all possible configurations of the domain walls under given boundary conditions and allows for a physical interpretation in terms of coarse-grained quantities such as surface and point tensions. The resulting integrals contain all the information about finite-size effects; we extract them by careful asymptotic analysis using the steepest descent method. To this end, we exactly determine the steepest descent path and analyse its features. For the general class of integrals, which are usually found in the study of systems with inclined domain walls, knowledge of the steepest descent path is necessary to detect possible intersections with poles of the integrand in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Advancing Stochastic 3-SAT Solvers by Dissipating Oversatisfied Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm, coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a unified perspective on thermal equilibrium and quantum dynamics by examining the simplest quantum system, a qubit, as a foundational model. We show that both the thermal partition function and the Loschmidt amplitude can be understood as extensions of a single analytic function along different paths in the complex plane. The zeros of Loschmidt amplitude encode dynamical features such as orthogonality, rate function singularities, and quantum speed limits, in analogy with the role of partition function zeros in equilibrium statistical mechanics. We further establish, through the Cauchy-Riemann equations, that the high-temperature specific heat corresponds to early-time evolution. The discussion follows a pedagogical progression from a single qubit to an interacting spin chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated electron systems, superconductivity and charge density waves often coexist in close proximity, suggesting a deeper relationship between these competing phases. Recent research indicates that these orders can intertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in the electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional XY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial direction. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light on the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states, offering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.</description>

      <title>Robust global tripartite entanglement in a mixed spin-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the global tripartite entanglement in a Heisenberg trimer with mixed spins-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) under varying exchange couplings between dissimilar and identical spins, magnetic fields, and temperatures. The global tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all three bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map the regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous global entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite entangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities among the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability of global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special attention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a real three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa stands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes $1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of the mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement in this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic fields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation of robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable. The magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching a value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a connection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement, quantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities measured directly or indirectly from various experiments.</description>

      <title>The quantification of a genuine tetrapartite entanglement in a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The genuine tetrapartite entanglement of a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer is quantified according to the three different approaches incorporated all seven global bisections existing within the tetrapartite system. The degree of entanglement of each bisection is evaluated through the bipartite negativity at zero and non-zero temperature taking into account ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic type of intra- ($J$) and inter-dimer ($J_1$) exchange coupling inside the square plaquette. Three utilized quantification methods based on the generalization of (i) a genuine tripartite negativity, (ii) a Coffman, Kundu and Wootters monogamy relation and (iii) a geometric average of complete trisections, result to the qualitatively and almost quantitatively identical behavior of a genuine tetrapartite negativity. It is shown that the genuine tetrapartite negativity exclusively arises from the antiferromagnetic-inter dimer $J_1&gt;0$ coupling, whereas the character of with respect to $J$ ($J&gt;0$ or $J&lt;0$) determines its zero-temperature magnitude and its thermal stability with respect to the magnetic field and temperature. As is demonstrated for $0&lt;J_1/J&lt;1$ the genuine tetrapartite negativity is dramatically reduced due to the preference of magnetic arrangement involving two separable mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimers. In an opposite limit the genuine tetrapartite negativity is significantly stable with a threshold temperature proportional to the strength of an inter-dimer coupling $J_1$. It is found, that all three quantification procedures are insufficient to correctly describe the genuine tetrapartite negativity in a specific part of the parameter space with absence of relevant dimer separable states. Finally, the thermal stability of a genuine tetrapartite negativity is discussed in detail for selected geometries motivated by the real tetranuclear bimetallic complexes with a Cu$_2$Ni$_2$ magnetic core.</description>

      <title>Pseudocriticality in antiferromagnetic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows ("walking behavior") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N&gt;2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.</description>

Abstract: Light-matter systems that exhibit two-photon interactions have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring quantum applications. In this work, we focus on the two-photon Dicke model, a system of significant experimental relevance that displays spectral collapse and undergoes a phase transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. We analyze the normal phase, where a classical limit with two degrees of freedom can be derived using a mean-field approximation. Our study presents a detailed investigation of the loss of integrability in the two-photon Dicke model, employing both quantum and classical diagnostics. These results allow us to explore various dynamical features of the system, including the onset of chaos and the existence of mixed phase-space behavior.</description>

      <title>Operator-space fragmentation and integrability in Pauli-Lindblad models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation for open quantum systems is central to our understanding of coherence and entanglement in the presence of Markovian dissipation. In closed quantum systems Hilbert-space fragmentation is an effective mechanism for slowing decoherence in the presence of constrained interactions. We develop a general mechanism for operator-space fragmentation of mixed states, undergoing Lindbladian evolution generated by frustration-free Hamiltonians and Pauli-string jump operators. The interplay of generator algebras of dissipative and unitary dynamics leads to a hierarchical partitioning of operator and real space into dynamically disconnected subspaces, which we elucidate using the bond and commutant algebras of superoperators. This fragmentation fundamentally constrains information spreading in open systems and provides new mechanisms to control highly entangled quantum states and dynamics. Our approach yields two key advances. Firstly, we introduce frustration graphs in operator space as a compact representation to construct effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in individual fragments and diagnose their free-fermion solvability. Secondly, using these methods we uncover a range of universal dynamical regimes in Pauli-Lindblad models, exhibiting symmetry enriched quantum chaos and integrability in operator-space fragments. Furthermore, we show dissipation-driven phase transitions corresponding to exceptional points in the Lindbladian spectrum whose signatures are captured by spectral statistics and operator dynamics. These results establish operator-space fragmentation as a fundamental principle for open quantum systems, with immediate implications for quantum error correction, where protected subspaces could emerge naturally from fragmentation. Our framework provides a systematic approach to discover and characterize novel non-equilibrium phases in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of synchrony essentially underlies the functionality of many systems across physics, biology and engineering. In all established synchronization phase transitions so far, a stable synchronous state is connected to a stable incoherent state: For continuous transitions, stable synchrony directly connects to stable incoherence at a critical point, whereas for discontinuous transitions, stable synchrony is connected to stable incoherence via an additional unstable branch. Here we present a novel type of transition between synchrony and incoherence where the synchronous state does not connect to the state of incoherence. We uncover such transitions in the complexified Kuramoto model with their variables and coupling strength parameter analytically continued. Deriving a self-consistency equation for a quaternion order parameter that we propose helps to mathematically pin down the mechanisms underlying this transition type. Local numerical analysis suggests that the transition is linked to a Hopf bifurcation destabilizing synchrony, in contrast to branching point bifurcations established for the transition between synchrony and incoherence so far.</description>

      <title>Cascade at local yield strain for silica and metallic glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report observations of unusal \emph{first} plastic events in silica and metallic glasses in the shear startup regime at applied strain two orders of magnitude smaller than yield strain. The (non-Affine) particle displacement field during these events have complex real space structure with multiple disconnected cores of high displacement appearing at the \emph{same} applied strain under athermal quasistatic simple shear deformation, and identified by a ``cell based cluster analysis'' method. By monitoring the stress relaxation during the first plastic event by Langevin dynamics simulation, we directly show the cascade nature of these events. Thus these first plastic events are reminiscent of avalanches in the post-yielding steady state, but unlike the steady state avalanches, we show that these events are not system spanning. To understand the nature of these events, we tune three factors that are known to affect brittleness of a glass. These are (i) sample preparation history, (ii) inter-particle interactions and (iii) rigidity of the background matrix applying a ``soft matrix'' probe recently developed by some of us. In each case we show that such first plastic events are more probable in more ductile glasses. Our observations are consistent with the picture that more ductile materials are softer, implying that understanding the role of softness may be a promising route to develop microscopic quantifiers of brittleness and thus clarifying the physical origin of brittle-to-ductile transition.</description>

Abstract: Phase transition of the two- and three-state quantum Potts models on the Sierpi\'nski pyramid are studied by means of a tensor network framework, the higher-order tensor renormalization group method. Critical values of the transverse magnetic field and the magnetic exponent $\beta$ are evaluated. Despite the fact that the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpi\'nski pyramid is exactly two $( = \log_2^{~} 4)$, the obtained critical properties show that the effective dimension is lower than two.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous sampling of multiple transition channels using adaptive paths of collective variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a molecular simulation method to simultaneously find multiple transition pathways, and their associated free-energy profiles. The scheme extends path-metadynamics (PMD) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 020601 (2012)] with multiple paths and repulsive walkers (multiPMD). We illustrate multiPMD for two C7eq-to-C7ax paths in Ace-Ala-Nme and six PPII-to-PPII paths in Ace-(Pro)4-Nme. We also show a scheme to render an interpretable "PathMap", showing the free energy ridges between paths, as well as the branching and merging of the transition channels. MultiPMD is a flexible and promising method for systems with competing or controversial pathways, which appear in many biomolecular systems, including proteins and nucleic acids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extension of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to derive a "speed limit" theorem for nonlinear electronic devices. This speed limit provides a lower bound on the dissipation that is incurred when transferring a given amount of electric charge in a certain amount of time with a certain noise level (average variance of the current). This bound, which implies a high energy dissipation for fast, low-noise operations (such as switching a bit in a digital memory), brings together recent results of stochastic thermodynamics into a form that is usable for practical nonlinear electronic circuits, as we illustrate on a switching circuit made of an nMOS pass gate in a state-of-the-art industrial technology.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>Surface Tension of a Topological Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes of the scalar field. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</description>

      <title>Global thermodynamic manifold for conservative control of stochastic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal control of stochastic systems plays a central role in nonequilibrium physics, with applications in the study of biological molecular motors and the design of single-molecule experiments. While exact analytic solutions to optimization problems are rare, under slow driving conditions, the problem can be reformulated geometrically solely in terms of equilibrium properties. In this framework, minimum-work protocols are geodesics on a thermodynamic manifold whose metric is a generalized friction tensor. Here, we introduce a new foundation for this friction-tensor formalism for conservatively driven systems. Under complete control of the potential energy, a global thermodynamic manifold (on which points are identified with instantaneous energy landscapes) has as its metric a full-control friction tensor. Arbitrary partial-control friction tensors arise naturally as inherited metrics on submanifolds of this global manifold. Leveraging a simple mathematical relationship between system dynamics and the geometry of the global manifold, we derive new expressions for the friction tensor that offer powerful tools for interpretation and computation of friction tensors and minimum-work protocols. Our results elucidate a connection between relaxation and dissipation in slowly driven systems and suggest optimization heuristics. We demonstrate the utility of these developments in three illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) delineate tradeoff relations between the thermodynamic cost and the magnitude of an observable's fluctuation. While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.</description>

      <title>System-independent lower bounds on entropy production incurred by running a computer program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mismatch cost (MMC) is a universally applicable lower bound on both the entropy production (EP) of any fixed physical process across a given time interval. In this work we use MMC for the first time to lower-bound the amount of work dissipated by running a high-level or assembler-level computer program. To begin, we extend previous results concerning MMC to prove that it scales at least linearly with the total heat flow in the worst case over initial distributions. This establishes that - in contrast to results like the thermodynamic speed limit theorem or thermodynamic uncertainty relations - it is often a substantial fraction of the work dissipated on macroscopic scales. We also prove that the MMC lower bound over a given time interval never decreases if the time interval is subdivided into a sequence of sub-intervals, and that the bound often increases. Armed with these results, we then introduce a general framework for computing the minimal EP (i.e., the MMC) associated with running any computer program on any physical system that implements a modern digital computer. Crucially, this framework holds completely independently of the microscopic physical details of that system. Next we apply this general framework to compare lower bounds on the EP incurred by running two canonical sorting algorithms, bubble sort and Bucket sort. This enables us to investigate how thermodynamic cost depends on features like input size and structure (e.g., with or without repeated entries). Finally, we extend the framework to programs that call subroutines.</description>

      <title>Geometric Brownian information engine with finite cycle time: Optimisation of output work, power and efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Geometric Brownian Information Engine to explore the effects of finite cycle time $(\tau)$ on the extractable work, power, and efficiency. We incorporate an error-free feedback controller that converts the information obtained about the state of overdamped Brownian particles, confined within a 2-D monolobal geometry, into extractable work. The performance of the information engine depends on the cycle period $(\tau)$, measurement distance $(x_m)$, and feedback location $(x_f)$ of the controller. Upon increasing the feedback cycle time, the engine transitions from a high non-equilibrium steady state to a completely relaxed state. We set the measurement distance at an optimum position related to a fully relaxed state ($x_m^* \sim 0.6 \sigma$). When the cycle time is finite and short ($\tau &lt;\tau_r$), the best information processing occurs with a shorter distance of the feedback site. While increasing the cycle time towards a fully relaxed state ($\tau \gg \tau_r$), the maximum extractable work that can be achieved with a feedback location is set to be twice that of $x_m^*$, as expected. When the cycle time ($\tau$) is longer than the relaxation time ($\tau_r$), the maximum power is achieved when the scaled feedback location is exactly double the optimum measurement distance ($x_f^{*}=2x_m^*$). In contrast, when $\tau &lt; \tau_r$, the maximum power is achieved when the feedback site is set at a lower value. As the $\tau$ increases, the maximum average power decreases. In the limit of a long $\tau$, the highest efficiency as well extractable work is attained when $x_f$ is located at $2x_m$, regardless of the level of entropic control. As the dominance of entropic control increases, the extractable work and efficiency in the fully relaxed state decrease due to higher information loss during relaxation.</description>

      <title>The cost of resetting discrete-time random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time continuous-space random walk, with a symmetric jump distribution, under stochastic resetting. Associated with the random walker are cost functions for jumps and resets, and we calculate the distribution of the total cost for the random walker up to the first passage to the target. By using the backward master equation approach we demonstrate that the distribution of the total cost up to the first passage to the target can be reduced to a Wiener-Hopf integral equation. The resulting integral equation can be exactly solved (in Laplace space) for arbitrary cost functions for the jump and selected functions for the reset cost. We show that the large cost behaviour is dominated by resetting or the jump distribution according to the choice of the jump distribution. In the important case of a Laplace jump distribution, which corresponds to run-and-tumble particle dynamics, and linear costs for jumps and resetting, the Wiener-Hopf equation simplifies to a differential equation which can easily be solved.</description>

      <title>Pilot-waves and copilot-particles: A novel approach to objective collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of Schr\"odinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schr\"odinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping entanglement in quantum spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term altermagnetism has recently been introduced to describe the N\'eel order of a class of materials whose magnetic sublattices are neither related by translation nor inversion. While these materials arguably have large technological potential, little effort has been devoted to studying the universal distinction of this phase of matter compared to collinear antiferromagnetism. Employing a recently proposed minimal microscopic model, we explicitly derive a nonlinear sigma model describing long-wavelength fluctuations of the staggered magnetization in this system, including quantum effects to leading order. The term that distinguishes the altermagnetic nonlinear sigma model from its antiferromagnetic counterpart is an interaction term that derives directly from the Berry phase of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom. Its effects on the one-loop renormalization group flow in $d=2+1$ dimensions are examined. Extending the theory to describe the fermionic excitations of the metallic altermagnet, we find an effective low-energy model of $d$-wave spin-split Dirac fermions interacting with the magnetic fluctuations. Using a Dyson-Schwinger approach, we derive the many-body effects on the dynamical critical scaling due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb interaction and the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization.</description>

Abstract: Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of thermodynamic functioning regimes from finite coupling between a quantum thermal machine and a load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous quantum thermal machines are particularly suited to understand how correlations between thermal baths, a load, and a thermal machine affect the overall thermodynamic functioning of the setup. Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>
