      <title>Explainable AI-Enhanced Supervisory Control for High-Precision Spacecraft Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use artificial intelligence (AI) and supervisory adaptive control systems to plan and optimize the mission of precise spacecraft formation. Machine learning and robust control enhance the efficiency of spacecraft precision formation of the Virtual Telescope for X-ray Observation (VTXO) space mission. VTXO is a precise formation of two separate spacecraft making a virtual telescope with a one-kilometer focal length. One spacecraft carries the lens and the other spacecraft holds the camera to observe high-energy space objects in the X-ray domain with 55 milli-arcsecond angular resolution accuracy. Timed automata for supervisory control, Monte Carlo simulations for stability and robustness evaluation, and integration of deep neural networks for optimal estimation of mission parameters, satisfy the high precision mission criteria. We integrate deep neural networks with a constrained, non-convex dynamic optimization pipeline to predict optimal mission parameters, ensuring precision mission criteria are met. AI framework provides explainability by predicting the resulting energy consumption and mission error for a given set of mission parameters. It allows for transparent, justifiable, and real-time trade-offs, a capability not present in traditional adaptive controllers. The results show reductions in energy consumption and improved mission accuracy, demonstrating the capability of the system to address dynamic uncertainties and disturbances.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Anomaly Detection for Ia Cosmology: Automating SALT3 Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires robust quality control of large, heterogeneous datasets. Current data processing often relies on manual, subjective rejection of photometric data, a practice that is not scalable for forthcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a Bayesian framework that automates this step by integrating anomaly detection directly into the light curve fitting process. While the framework is model-agnostic and compatible with any spectral energy distribution (SED) model, here we demonstrate its application with the SALT3 model, implemented fully on GPU using \texttt{JAX-bandflux} for computational efficiency. Our method models the probability of each photometric measurement being anomalous with respect to the model, simultaneously inferring the physical supernova parameters and each data point's posterior probability of being a contaminant. Applying this framework to the Hawaii Supernova Flows dataset, we demonstrate its three principal capabilities: (i) robust mitigation of isolated outliers; (ii) automated identification and rejection of entirely corrupted bandpasses; and (iii) preservation of valid data by flagging only specific anomalous points within otherwise usable filters. We also find that contaminants are systematically brighter and bluer, which if uncorrected could bias subsequent cosmological inference.</description>

      <title>Scheduling follow-up observations of energetic transients with the neutrino target scheduler (NuTS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space missions offer unique opportunities for studying ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and neutrinos by leveraging secondary emissions generated by extensive air showers (EAS) resulting from their interactions with the atmosphere or Earth's crust. Detecting UHE neutrinos associated with transient sources holds great potential for unraveling the origins of UHE cosmic rays and the physical processes driving their production. Stratospheric balloon missions, illustrated recently by the Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon II Mission, serve as crucial precursors to space missions. Due to slewing abilities of their telescopes, they can perform follow-up observations of transient sources foreseen as potential candidates for detectable UHE neutrino emissions. Strategies tailored to stratospheric and space missions are essential for optimizing follow-up observations aimed at detecting these elusive neutrinos for the first time. To address this challenge, we have developed a flexible software dedicated to scheduling transient source observations. The software comprises three main modules: a listener module that aggregates alerts from existing alert systems to construct a comprehensive source database, an observability module that factors in the detection system's properties and trajectory to determine a list of observable sources during a specific timeframe, and a scheduler module that prioritizes observations and proposes an optimized observation schedule. The initial release of the neutrino target scheduler software is tailored to the requirements of stratospheric balloon missions, with mock observation examples provided for various flight scenarios. This version will be employed for the upcoming PBR flight in 2027. Future developments will extend its capabilities, and ensure its relevance for various types of missions.</description>

      <title>A simple, flexible method for timing cross-calibration of space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The timing (cross-)calibration of astronomical instruments is often done by comparing pulsar times-of-arrival (TOAs) to a reference timing model. In high-energy astronomy, the choice of solar system ephemerides and source positions used to barycenter the photon arrival times has a significant impact on the procedure, requiring a full reprocessing the data each time a new convention is used. Our method, developed as part of the activities of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), adapts an existing pulsar solution to arbitrary JPL ephemerides and source positions by simulating geocentric TOAs and refitting timing models (implemented with PINT). We validate the procedure and apply it to thousands of observations of the Crab pulsar from 14 missions spanning 2002--2025, demonstrating inter-ephemeris TOA consistency at the $\lesssim5\,\mu$s level, using the DE200/FK5-based Jodrell Bank Monthly Ephemeris as a reference. We release open-source tools (TOAextractor) and a TOA database to support future calibration and scientific studies. Instrument timing performance is broadly consistent with mission specifications; the X-ray-to-radio phase offset varies with energy and time at a level that is marginally compatible with the uncertainties of the radio ephemeris, motivating coordinated multiwavelength follow-up.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological reach of a gravitational wave observatory using Deep Loop Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.</description>

      <title>Planet Earth in reflected and polarized light -- III. Modeling and analysis of a decade-long catalog of Earthshine observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earthshine observations offer a unique opportunity to study Earth as an exoplanet seen from the Moon. As the Sun-Earth-Moon geometry changes, Earth can be observed as a spatially unresolved exoplanet at different phase angles, providing important context for future observations of Earth-like exoplanets. Here, we present a catalog of Earthshine polarization spectra obtained with FORS2 on the VLT, covering diverse scenes, surface conditions, cloud properties, and weather patterns for over a decade. For the first time, we model this extensive dataset in detail using a homogeneous modeling framework. Previous efforts to model some of these spectra struggled to reproduce the observed polarization continuum, even with advanced 3D radiative transfer models incorporating satellite-derived surface and atmospheric data. We improve upon this with a 3D model that includes subgrid cloud variability, wavelength-dependent surface albedo maps, and an accurate treatment of ocean glint. Our simulations successfully reproduce most observed spectra to a much higher precision than previously possible. Our statistical analysis reveals that the spectral slope in the visible can distinguish between ocean and mixed surfaces in both reflected and polarized light, which is not possible using broadband filters alone. Polarized light at large phase angles, beyond the Rayleigh scattering regime, is particularly effective in differentiating oceans from land, unlike reflected light. We also identify correlations between cloud optical thickness and the polarized spectral slope, and between cloud cover and broadband B-R differences in reflected light, demonstrating the diagnostic power of these observations. This work highlight the potential of polarization for characterizing Earth-like exoplanets. From polarization alone, we can infer oceans, vegetation, and an active water cycle, key indicators of a habitable planet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes delve into field-level inference, a framework offering a robust way to extract more information and avoid biases compared to traditional methods for cosmological data analysis. The core idea is to analyse uncompressed maps to infer underlying physical fields and cosmological parameters. We introduce Bayesian hierarchical field-level models and discuss sampling techniques for exploring complex, high-dimensional posterior distributions. We review the framework that underpins field-level inference. Finally, we highlight some state-of-the-art applications across various cosmological probes, and the growing role of machine learning in enhancing field-level inference capabilities.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Methods for Detecting Exomoons Orbiting Imaged Exoplanets: Prospects for Detecting Moons Orbiting a Giant Planet in $\alpha$ Centauri A's Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearby giant exoplanets offer an opportunity to search for moons (exomoons) orbiting them. Here, we present a simulation framework for investigating the possibilities of detecting exomoons via their astrometric signal in planet-to-star relative astrometry. We focus our simulations on $\alpha$ Centauri A, orbited by a hypothetical giant planet consistent with candidate detections in Very Large Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations. We consider a variety of observatory architectures capable of searching for exomoons, including upcoming facilities and also a hypothetical dedicated facility $-$ e.g., a purpose-built space telescope with diameter = 3m, central observing wavelength of 500 nm, and contrast-limited performance of $\sim$10$^{-9}$ in 1 hr observations. We find that such a facility would be capable of detecting $\sim$Earth-mass moons in a five year campaign, assuming a Saturn-mass planet. More generally, we simulate expected detection limits for a variety of levels of astrometric precision. We find that moons as small as $\sim$0.2 M$_\oplus$ on orbital periods of 4$-$30 days can be detected with astrometric precision of 0.1 mas and observing cadence of 1 hr over a five year campaign. Additionally, we find that a 39m ground-based telescope can detect Earth-sized exomoons orbiting the same hypothetical planet with a more modest observing cadence of one day. We discuss these results as motivation for a dedicated space observatory as well as a more detailed study of the physical parameters of a greater variety of star-planet-moon systems.</description>

      <title>ARDENT: A Python package for fast dynamical detection limits with radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The architecture of planetary systems is a key piece of information to our understanding of their formation and evolution. This information also allows us to place the Solar System in the exoplanet context. An important example is the impact of outer giant planets on the formation of inner super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Radial velocity (RV) surveys aim at drawing statistical insights into the (anti-)correlations between giants and inner small planets, which remain unclear. These surveys are limited by the completeness of the systems, namely, the sensitivity of the data to planet detections. Here, we show that we can improve the completeness by accounting for orbital stability. We introduce the Algorithm for the Refinement of DEtection limits via N-body stability Threshold (ARDENT), an open-source Python package for detection limits that include the stability constraint. The code computes the classic data-driven detection limits, along with the dynamical limits via both analytical and numerical stability criteria. We present the code strategy and illustrate its performance on TOI-1736 using published SOPHIE RVs. This system contains an eccentric cold giant on a 570-day orbit and an inner sub-Neptune on a 7-day orbit. We demonstrate that no additional planet can exist in this system beyond 150 days due to the gravitational influence of the giant. This outcome allows us to significantly refine the system completeness and also carries implications for RV follow-ups. ARDENT is user-friendly and can be employed across a wide variety of systems to refine our understanding of their architecture.</description>

      <title>GWKokab: An Implementation to Identify the Properties of Multiple Population of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability.
  In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers.
  To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3).
  We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Inference of Massive Black Hole Binaries using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-based approach for parameter estimation of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs), leveraging normalizing flows to approximate the likelihood function. By training these flows on simulated data, we can generate posterior samples via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with a relatively reduced computational cost. Our method enables iterative refinement of smaller models targeting specific MBHB events, with significantly fewer waveform template evaluations. However, dimensionality reduction is crucial to make the method computationally feasible: it dictates both the quality and time efficiency of the method. We present initial results for a single MBHB with Gaussian noise and aim to extend our work to increasingly realistic scenarios, including waveforms with higher modes, non-stationary noise, glitches, and data gaps.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS): TBD. Unveiling physical processes in local active galaxies. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of JWST MIRI/MRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances &lt;100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]</description>

      <title>UFig v1: The ultra-fast image generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, simulations need to be fast as well as realistic. $\texttt{UFig v1}$ is a public Python package that simulates astronomical images with exceptional speed, taking approximately the same time as source extraction. This makes it particularly well-suited for SBI methods where computational efficiency is crucial. To render an image, $\texttt{UFig}$ requires a galaxy catalog, and a description of the point spread function (PSF). It can also add background noise, sample stars using the Besan\c{c}on model of the Milky Way, and run $\texttt{SExtractor}$ to extract sources from the rendered image. The extracted sources can be matched to the intrinsic catalog, flagged based on $\texttt{SExtractor}$ output and survey masks, and emulators can be used to bypass the image simulation and extraction steps. A first version of $\texttt{UFig}$ was presented in Berg\'e et al. (2013) and the software has since been used and further developed in a variety of forward modelling applications.</description>

      <title>PyPLUTO: a data analysis Python package for the PLUTO code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, numerical simulations have become indispensable for addressing complex astrophysical problems. The MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) framework represents a key tool for investigating the dynamical evolution of astrophysical plasmas, which are described as a set of partial differential equations that enforce the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, along with Maxwell's equations for the evolution of the electromagnetic fields. Due to the high nonlinearity of the MHD equations (regardless of their specifications, e.g., classical/relativistic or ideal/resistive), a general analytical solution is precluded, making the numerical approach crucial. Numerical simulations usually end up producing large sets of data files, and their scientific analysis leans on dedicated software designed for data visualization. However, in order to encompass all of the code output features, specialized tools focusing on the numerical code may represent a more versatile and built-in tool. Here, we present PyPLUTO, a Python package tailored for efficient loading, manipulation, and visualization of outputs produced with the PLUTO code (Mignone et al., 2007; Mignone et al., 2012). PyPLUTO uses memory mapping to optimize data loading and provides general routines for data manipulation and visualization. PyPLUTO also supports the particle modules of the PLUTO code, enabling users to load and visualize particles, such as cosmic rays (Mignone et al., 2018), Lagrangian (Vaidya et al., 2018), or dust (Mignone et al., 2019) particles, from hybrid simulations. A dedicated Graphical User Interface simplifies the generation of single-subplot figures, making PyPLUTO a powerful yet user-friendly toolkit for astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Recovering CMB polarization maps with neural networks: Performance in realistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) is essential for shedding light on the exponential expansion of the very early Universe, known as cosmic inflation. Achieving this goal requires not only improved instrumental sensitivity but also the development of robust and diverse data analysis techniques. In this work, we explore a novel component separation approach based on neural networks to reconstruct the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ polarization maps. To validate the method, we first test the network on realistic \textit{Planck} sky simulations, finding a mean absolute error of $0.1 \pm 0.3~\mu K^{2}$ for the $E$-mode and $-0.1 \pm 0.3~\mu K^{2}$ for the $B$-mode. We then apply the trained network to public \textit{Planck} observations, with results consistent with those obtained using the Commander method. Based on these findings, we conclude that neural network-based methods show potential as component separation techniques in polarization CMB experiments. However, substantial improvements and more comprehensive analyses are necessary before these methods can provide reliable high-precision cosmological estimates.</description>

      <title>The impact of diffuse Galactic emission on direction-independent gain calibration in high-redshift 21 cm observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of diffuse Galactic emission (DGE) on sky-based direction-independent (DI) gain calibration using realistic forward simulations of Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations of the high-redshift 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We simulated LOFAR observations between 147 and 159 MHz using a sky model that includes a point source catalog and DGE. The simulated observations were DI-gain calibrated with the point source catalog alone, utilizing the LOFAR-EoR data analysis pipeline. A full power spectrum (PS) analysis was conducted to measure the systematic bias, relative to thermal noise, caused by DI-gain calibration using a point-source-only (PSO) sky model, when applied to simulated data that include both point sources and DGE. The results are compared to a ground truth scenario where both the simulated sky and the calibration model include only point sources. Additionally, the cross-coherence between observation pairs was computed to determine whether DI-gain calibration errors are coherent or incoherent in specific regions of PS space as a function of integration time. We find that DI-gain calibration with a PSO sky model that omits DGE introduces a systematic bias in the PS for $k_{\parallel}$ bins &lt; 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The PS errors in these bins are coherent in time and frequency; therefore, the resulting bias could be mitigated during the foreground removal step using Gaussian Process Regression, as demonstrated in previous studies. In contrast, errors for $k_{\parallel}$ &gt; 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ are largely incoherent and average down as noise. We conclude that, based on our analysis prior to foreground removal, missing DGE in the sky model during DI-gain calibration is unlikely to be a dominant contributor to the excess noise observed in the current LOFAR-EoR upper limits on the 21 cm signal PS.</description>

      <title>Update of the CODE catalogue and some aspects of the dynamical status of Oort Cloud comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The outer Solar System is believed to host a vast reservoir of long-period comets (LPCs), but our understanding of their spatial distribution and dynamical history remains limited due to observational biases and uncertainties in orbital solutions for really observed comets. We aim to provide a comprehensive and dynamically homogeneous orbital database of LPCs to support the study of their origin, evolution, dynamical status, and 6D distribution of orbital elements. We updated the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits and their Dynamical Evolution (CODE catalogue) by computing original and future barycentric orbits, orbital parameters at previous and next perihelion, using full Monte Carlo swarms of real comets for the uncertainty estimation and taking into account the planetary, Galactic and passing stars perturbations according to the latest data and algorithms. This update of the CODE catalogue focuses on the dynamical status of near-parabolic comets. Using current stellar data, we formulated new constraints for dynamically new comets. Now, the CODE database includes 983 orbital solutions for 369 comets with full uncertainty estimates and dynamical classifications, covering nearly all comets with original semi-major axes exceeding 10,000\,au and discovered before 2022, as well as all LPCs discovered beyond 10\,au from the Sun during this period, and over 80\% of the known LPCs with perihelion distances beyond 7\,au.</description>

      <title>Can LIGO Detect Daylight Savings Time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yes, it can.
  Catalogs produced by networks of Gravitational-wave interferometers are subject to complicated selection effects, and the gold-standard remains direct measurements of the detection probability through large injection campaigns. I leverage public data products from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' 3rd and 4th observing runs to show that there are non-trivial temporal variations within the detection probability that are well-described by a weekly cycle. There are clear differences between weekends and weekdays, between day and night (at the sites), and even between daylight-savings and standard time. I discuss possible causes for this behavior and implications.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning to assess astrophysical origin of gravitational waves triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a possible application of a machine learning classifier for candidate events in a template-based search for gravitational-wave (GW) signals from various compact system sources. We analyze data from the O3a and O3b data acquisition campaign, during which the sensitivity of ground-based detectors is limited by real non-Gaussian noise transient. The state-of-the-art searches for such signals tipically rely on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a chi-square test to assess the consistency of the signal with an inspiral template. In addition, a combination of these and other statistical properties are used to build a 're-weighted SNR' statistics. We evaluate a Random Forest classifiers on a set of double-coincidence events identified using the MBTA pipeline. The new classifier achieves a modest but consistent increase in event detection at low false positive rates relative to the standard search. Using the output statistics from the Random Forest classifier, we compute the probability of astrophysical origin for each event, denoted as $p_\mathrm{astro}$. This is then evaluated for the events listed in existing catalogs, with results consistent with those from the standard search. Finally, we search for new possible candidates using this new statistics, with $p_\mathrm{astro} &gt; 0.5$, obtaining a new subthreshold candidate (IFAR =0.05) event at $gps: 1240423628$ .</description>
