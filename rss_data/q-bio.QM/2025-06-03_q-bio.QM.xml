      <title>Improving statistical learning methods via features selection without replacement sampling and random projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations that disrupt normal gene expression, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. High-dimensional microarray datasets pose challenges for classification models due to the "small n, large p" problem, resulting in overfitting. This study makes three different key contributions: 1) we propose a machine learning-based approach integrating the Feature Selection Without Re-placement (FSWOR) technique and a projection method to improve classification accuracy. 2) We apply the Kendall statistical test to identify the most significant genes from the brain cancer mi-croarray dataset (GSE50161), reducing the feature space from 54,675 to 20,890 genes.3) we apply machine learning models using k-fold cross validation techniques in which our model incorpo-rates ensemble classifiers with LDA projection and Na\"ive Bayes, achieving a test score of 96%, outperforming existing methods by 9.09%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proach in high-dimensional gene expression analysis, improving classification accuracy while mitigating overfitting. This study contributes to cancer biomarker discovery, offering a robust computational method for analyzing microarray data.</description>

      <title>A novel sensitivity analysis method for agent-based models stratifies \emph{in-silico} tumor spheroid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in biology to understand how individual actions scale into emergent population behavior. Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the \textbf{S}imulate, \textbf{S}ummarize, \textbf{R}educe, \textbf{C}luster, and \textbf{A}nalyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA provides similar SA results to the popular Sobol' Method while also identifying four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Drug Discovery: Autoencoder-Based Latent Space Augmentation for Improved Molecular Solubility Prediction using LatMixSol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular solubility is a cornerstone of early-stage drug discovery, yet conventional machine learning models face significant challenges due to limited labeled data and the high-dimensional nature of molecular descriptors. To address these issues, we propose LatMixSol, a novel latent space augmentation framework that combines autoencoder-based feature compression with guided interpolation to enrich training data. Our approach first encodes molecular descriptors into a low-dimensional latent space using a two-layer autoencoder. Spectral clustering is then applied to group chemically similar molecules, enabling targeted MixUp-style interpolation within clusters. Synthetic samples are generated by blending latent vectors of cluster members and decoding them back to the original feature space. Evaluated on the Huuskonen solubility benchmark, LatMixSol demonstrates consistent improvements across three of four gradient-boosted regressors (CatBoost, LightGBM, HistGradientBoosting), achieving RMSE reductions of 3.2-7.6% and R-squared increases of 0.5-1.5%. Notably, HistGradientBoosting shows the most significant enhancement with a 7.6% RMSE improvement. Our analysis confirms that cluster-guided latent space augmentation preserves chemical validity while expanding dataset diversity, offering a computationally efficient strategy to enhance predictive models in resource-constrained drug discovery pipelines.</description>

      <title>Look mom, no experimental data! Learning to score protein-ligand interactions from simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in protein-ligand structure prediction, deep learning methods remain limited in their ability to accurately predict binding affinities, particularly for novel protein targets dissimilar from the training set. In contrast, physics-based binding free energy calculations offer high accuracy across chemical space but are computationally prohibitive for large-scale screening. We propose a hybrid approach that approximates the accuracy of physics-based methods by training target-specific neural networks on molecular dynamics simulations of the protein in complex with random small molecules. Our method uses force matching to learn an implicit free energy landscape of ligand binding for each target. Evaluated on six proteins, our approach achieves competitive virtual screening performance using 100-500 $\mu$s of MD simulations per target. Notably, this approach achieves state-of-the-art early enrichment when using the true pose for active compounds. These results highlight the potential of physics-informed learning for virtual screening on novel targets. We publicly release the code for this paper at https://github.com/molecularmodelinglab/lfm.</description>

      <title>Getting More from Less: Transfer Learning Improves Sleep Stage Decoding Accuracy in Peripheral Wearable Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning, a technique commonly used in generative artificial intelligence, allows neural network models to bring prior knowledge to bear when learning a new task. This study demonstrates that transfer learning significantly enhances the accuracy of sleep-stage decoding from peripheral wearable devices by leveraging neural network models pretrained on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Consumer wearable technologies typically rely on peripheral physiological signals such as pulse plethysmography (PPG) and respiratory data, which, while convenient, lack the fidelity of clinical electroencephalography (EEG) for detailed sleep-stage classification. We pretrained a transformer-based neural network on a large, publicly available EEG dataset and subsequently fine-tuned this model on noisier peripheral signals. Our transfer learning approach improved overall classification accuracy from 67.6\% (baseline model trained solely on peripheral signals) to 76.6\%. Notable accuracy improvements were observed across sleep stages, particularly lighter sleep stages such as REM and N1. These results highlight transfer learning's potential to substantially enhance the accuracy and utility of consumer wearable devices without altering existing hardware. Future integration of self-supervised learning methods may further boost performance, facilitating more precise, longitudinal sleep monitoring for personalized health applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of computational approaches for predicting Transthyretin transcription activators and human dopamine D1 receptor antagonists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study expands the application of scikit-learn-based machine learning (ML) to the prediction of small biomolecule functionalities based on Carbon 13 isotope (13C) NMR spectroscopy data derived from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notations. The methodology previously demonstrated by predicting dopamine D1 receptor antagonists was upgraded with addition of new molecular features derived from the PubChem database. The enhanced ML model obtained 75.8% Accuracy, 84.2% Precision, 63.6% Recall, 72.5% F1-score, 75.8 % ROC, when is trained by 25,532 samples and tested by 5,466 samples. To evaluate the applicability of the methodology for a variety of case studies, a comparison was conducted between the prediction capabilities of the ML models based on the human dopamine D1 receptor antagonists and on the neuronal Transthyretin (TTR) transcription activators. Since the TTR bioassay did not contain the needed for the comparison number of samples, the results were obtained hypothetically. Gradient Boosting classifier was the optimal model for TTR transcription activators achieving hypothetical 67.4% Accuracy, 74.0% Precision, 53.5% Recall, 62.1% F1-score, 67.4 % ROC, if it would be trained with 25,532 samples and tested with 5,466 samples. Beyond the main study, the CID_SID ML model that can predict if a small biomolecule has TTR transcription activation capabilities based solely on its PubChem CID and SID achieved 81.5% Accuracy, 94.6% Precision, 66.8% Recall, 78.3% F1-score, 81.5 % ROC.</description>

      <title>Assessing Honey Bee Colony Health Using Temperature Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Honey bees face an increasing number of stressors that disrupt the natural behaviour of colonies and, in extreme cases, can lead to their collapse. Quantifying the status and resilience of colonies is essential to measure the impact of stressors and to identify colonies at risk. In this manuscript, we present and apply new methodologies to efficiently diagnose the status of a honey bee colony from widely available time series of hive and environmental temperature. Healthy hives have a remarkable ability to control temperature near the brood area. Our method exploits this fact and quantifies the status of a hive by measuring how resilient they are to extreme environmental temperatures, which act as natural stressors. Analysing 22 hives during different times of the year, including 3 hives that collapsed, we find the statistical signatures of stress that reveal whether honeybees are doing well or are at risk of failure. Based on these analyses, we propose a simple scale of hive status (stable, warning, and collapse) that can be determined based on a few temperature measurements. Our approach offers a lower-cost and practical bee-monitoring solution, providing a non-invasive way to track hive conditions and trigger interventions to save the hives from collapse.</description>

      <title>ModuLM: Enabling Modular and Multimodal Molecular Relational Learning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) aims to understand interactions between molecular pairs, playing a critical role in advancing biochemical research. With the recent development of large language models (LLMs), a growing number of studies have explored the integration of MRL with LLMs and achieved promising results. However, the increasing availability of diverse LLMs and molecular structure encoders has significantly expanded the model space, presenting major challenges for benchmarking. Currently, there is no LLM framework that supports both flexible molecular input formats and dynamic architectural switching. To address these challenges, reduce redundant coding, and ensure fair model comparison, we propose ModuLM, a framework designed to support flexible LLM-based model construction and diverse molecular representations. ModuLM provides a rich suite of modular components, including 8 types of 2D molecular graph encoders, 11 types of 3D molecular conformation encoders, 7 types of interaction layers, and 7 mainstream LLM backbones. Owing to its highly flexible model assembly mechanism, ModuLM enables the dynamic construction of over 50,000 distinct model configurations. In addition, we provide comprehensive results to demonstrate the effectiveness of ModuLM in supporting LLM-based MRL tasks.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Metabolic Stability Prediction with Dual-View Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular metabolic stability (MS) is critical for drug research and development but remains challenging due to the complex interplay of molecular interactions. Despite recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) for MS prediction, current approaches face two critical limitations: (1) incomplete molecular modeling due to atom-centric message-passing mechanisms that disregard bond-level topological features, and (2) prediction frameworks that lack reliable uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose TrustworthyMS, a novel contrastive learning framework designed for uncertainty-aware metabolic stability prediction. First, a molecular graph topology remapping mechanism synchronizes atom-bond interactions through edge-induced feature propagation, capturing both localized electronic effects and global conformational constraints. Second, contrastive topology-bond alignment enforces consistency between molecular topology views and bond patterns via feature alignment, enhancing representation robustness. Third, uncertainty modeling through Beta-Binomial uncertainty quantification enables simultaneous prediction and confidence calibration under epistemic uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate that TrustworthyMS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance.</description>

      <title>ChemAU: Harness the Reasoning of LLMs in Chemical Research with Adaptive Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various scenarios due to their exceptional reasoning capabilities and natural language understanding. While LLMs demonstrate strong performance in tasks involving mathematics and coding, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when applied to chemistry-related problems. Chemistry problems typically involve long and complex reasoning steps, which contain specific terminology, including specialized symbol systems and complex nomenclature conventions. These characteristics often cause general LLMs to experience hallucinations during the reasoning process due to their lack of specific knowledge. However, existing methods are struggling to effectively leverage chemical expertise and formulas. Moreover, current uncertainty estimation methods, designed to mitigate potential reasoning errors, are unable to precisely identify specific steps or key knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ChemAU, which incorporates our adaptive uncertainty estimation method that applies different uncertainty values based on the position of reasoning steps within the whole reasoning chain. Leveraging this method, ChemAU identifies gaps in chemistry knowledge and precisely supplements chemical expertise with the specialized domain model, thereby correcting and updating the previously flawed reasoning chain. Our experiments with three popular LLMs across three chemistry datasets demonstrate that ChemAU significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and uncertainty estimation.</description>

      <title>MUDI: A Multimodal Biomedical Dataset for Understanding Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction between different drugs (drug-drug interaction or DDI) is critical for ensuring patient safety and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. Existing DDI datasets primarily focus on textual information, overlooking multimodal data that reflect complex drug mechanisms. In this paper, we (1) introduce MUDI, a large-scale Multimodal biomedical dataset for Understanding pharmacodynamic Drug-drug Interactions, and (2) benchmark learning methods to study it. In brief, MUDI provides a comprehensive multimodal representation of drugs by combining pharmacological text, chemical formulas, molecular structure graphs, and images across 310,532 annotated drug pairs labeled as Synergism, Antagonism, or New Effect. Crucially, to effectively evaluate machine-learning based generalization, MUDI consists of unseen drug pairs in the test set. We evaluate benchmark models using both late fusion voting and intermediate fusion strategies. All data, annotations, evaluation scripts, and baselines are released under an open research license.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining dynamics to maximize irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many far-from-equilibrium biological systems, energy injected by irreversible processes at microscopic scales propagates to larger scales to fulfill important biological functions. But given dissipative dynamics at the microscale, how much irreversibility can persist at the macroscale? Here, we propose a model-free coarse-graining procedure that merges microscopic states to minimize the amount of lost irreversibility. Beginning with dynamical measurements, this procedure produces coarse-grained dynamics that retain as much information as possible about the underlying irreversibility. In synthetic and experimental data spanning molecular motors, biochemical oscillators, and recordings of neural activity, we derive simplified descriptions that capture the essential nonequilibrium processes. These results provide the tools to study the fundamental limits on the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility.</description>

      <title>RxRx3-core: Benchmarking drug-target interactions in High-Content Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Content Screening (HCS) microscopy datasets have transformed the ability to profile cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, enabling cell-based inference of drug-target interactions (DTI). However, the adoption of representation learning methods for HCS data has been hindered by the lack of accessible datasets and robust benchmarks. To address this gap, we present RxRx3-core, a curated and compressed subset of the RxRx3 dataset, and an associated DTI benchmarking task. At just 18GB, RxRx3-core significantly reduces the size barrier associated with large-scale HCS datasets while preserving critical data necessary for benchmarking representation learning models against a zero-shot DTI prediction task. RxRx3-core includes 222,601 microscopy images spanning 736 CRISPR knockouts and 1,674 compounds at 8 concentrations.

      <title>Transcriptome and Redox Proteome Reveal Temporal Scales of Carbon Metabolism Regulation in Model Cyanobacteria Under Light Disturbance</title>

Abstract: We develop a systems approach based on an energy-landscape concept to differentiate interactions involving redox activities and conformational changes of proteins and nucleic acids interactions in multi-layered protein-DNA regulatory networks under light disturbance. Our approach is a data-driven modeling workflow using a physics-informed machine learning algorithm to train a non-linear mathematical model for interpreting gene expression dynamics and to lead discovery for protein regulators using redox proteome analysis. We distinguish light-responsive elements within central carbon metabolism pathways from independent variables like circadian time using the publicly available transcriptome datasets of Synechococcus elongatus over diel cycles responding to light perturbations. Our approach provides interpretable de novo models for elucidating events of reactions in complex regulatory pathways in response to stressful disturbance from the environment. We discovered protein regulators in response to light disturbance in the proteome analysis involving shifts in protein abundance as well as cysteine redox states under constant illumination and after two hours of darkness. We discovered significant shifts in cysteine redox states in regulatory proteins such as transcription sigma factors and metabolic enzymes in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin-Benson cycle, while the changes in their protein abundance were minimal. These results indicate that regulatory dynamics in reductant generation link photo-induced electron transport pathways and redox metabolic pathways with circadian rhythms through fast redox-induced conformational changes or slow expression regulations across networks.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced proliferation of vortices around marine invertebrate larvae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of mm-sized invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their larval forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic 3D flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip to study their flows in quasi-2D. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number (&lt;1) flows in quasi-2D confinement, particularly in light of their complex forms, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement and illuminate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, the number of generated vortices significantly increased. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on the superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced flows, which suggests that vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than solely the body plan. Our work provides fundamental insights into form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cell Dynamics and Interactions with Unbalanced Mean Field Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the dynamics from sparsely time-resolved snapshot data is crucial for understanding complex cellular processes and behavior. Existing methods leverage optimal transport, Schr\"odinger bridge theory, or their variants to simultaneously infer stochastic, unbalanced dynamics from snapshot data. However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to account for cell-cell interactions. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios since intercellular communications are fundamental life processes and can influence cell state-transition dynamics. To address this challenge, we formulate the Unbalanced Mean-Field Schr\"odinger Bridge (UMFSB) framework to model unbalanced stochastic interaction dynamics from snapshot data. Inspired by this framework, we further propose CytoBridge, a deep learning algorithm designed to approximate the UMFSB problem. By explicitly modeling cellular transitions, proliferation, and interactions through neural networks, CytoBridge offers the flexibility to learn these processes directly from data. The effectiveness of our method has been extensively validated using both synthetic gene regulatory data and real scRNA-seq datasets. Compared to existing methods, CytoBridge identifies growth, transition, and interaction patterns, eliminates false transitions, and reconstructs the developmental landscape with greater accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tokenizing Electron Cloud in Protein-Ligand Interaction Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The affinity and specificity of protein-molecule binding directly impact functional outcomes, uncovering the mechanisms underlying biological regulation and signal transduction. Most deep-learning-based prediction approaches focus on structures of atoms or fragments. However, quantum chemical properties, such as electronic structures, are the key to unveiling interaction patterns but remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ECBind, a method for tokenizing electron cloud signals into quantized embeddings, enabling their integration into downstream tasks such as binding affinity prediction. By incorporating electron densities, ECBind helps uncover binding modes that cannot be fully represented by atom-level models. Specifically, to remove the redundancy inherent in electron cloud signals, a structure-aware transformer and hierarchical codebooks encode 3D binding sites enriched with electron structures into tokens. These tokenized codes are then used for specific tasks with labels. To extend its applicability to a wider range of scenarios, we utilize knowledge distillation to develop an electron-cloud-agnostic prediction model. Experimentally, ECBind demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, achieving improvements of 6.42\% and 15.58\% in per-structure Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, respectively.</description>
