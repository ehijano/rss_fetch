      <title>The origin of the most recently ejected OB runaway star from the R136 cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\sim 60\,000$ solar-mass (\MSun) star-cluster R136 (NGC~2070) in the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is the host of at least 55 massive stars ($M \apgt 10$\,\MSun) which move away from the cluster at projected velocities $\gteq 27.5$\,km/s \cite{2024Natur.634..809S}. The origin of the high velocities of such runaway stars have been debated since the 1960s, resulting either from dynamical ejections \citep{1961BAN....15..265B,1961BAN....15..291B} or from supernova explosions \citep{1983ApJ...267..322H}. Due to the Gaia satellite's outstanding precision, we can now retrace the most recently ejected binary star, Mel 34, back to the center of R136 and reconstruct the events that 52\,000 years ago let to its removal from R136, i.e., we establish its dynamical interaction and ejection history. We find that this ejection requires the participation of 5 stars in a strong interaction between a triple composed of the tight massive binary Mel~39 orbited by the star VFTS~590, and the binary star Mel~34. The participation of 5 stars is unexpected because runaway stars were not expected to result from triple interactions \cite{2011Sci...334.1380F}. The deterministic nature of the Newtonian dynamics in the scattering enables us to reconstruct the encounter that ejected Mel~34. We then predict that Mel~39 is a binary star with an 80\,\Msun\, companion star that orbits within $\sim 1^\circ$ in the same plane as Mel~34, and escapes the cluster with a velocity of $\sim 64$\,km/s. The five stars will undergo supernova explosions in the coming 5\,Myr at a distance of $\sim 180$\,pc to $\sim 332$\,pc from their birth location (R\,136). The resulting black hole binaries, however, are not expected to merge within a Hubble time.</description>

      <title>Extreme events in a random set of nonlinear elastic bending waves</title>

Abstract: The processes that generate rogue waves on the sea surface remain a mystery. Despite their different natures, the nonlinear bending waves generated in a thin elastic plate share some similarities with waves on the surface of the sea. For instance, both involve four-wave interactions during energy exchange, but in bending waves, the number of waves is not conserved. Here, we present an experimental study to investigate extreme event statistics in random elastic bending waves forced by an electromagnetic shaker on a thin stainless steel plate. In our setup, the standard statistical criterion used to define extreme events, such as rogue waves on the sea surface, is insufficiently restrictive. We therefore apply a new criterion to determine the occurrence frequency of rare events, similar to those observed in wave tanks. With this new criterion, we examine correlations between extreme events amplitude and wave slopes, energy, and periods, raising questions about the links between statistically rare events and rogue waves.</description>

      <title>Topological modes of variability of the wind-driven ocean circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Templexes are topological objects that encode the branching organization of a flow in phase space. We build on these objects to introduce the concept of \textit{topological modes of variability} (TMVs). TMVs are defined as dynamical manifestations of algebraically defined cycles, called generatexes, in the templex; they provide a concrete link between abstract topological invariants and time-dependent behavior in a model or in observations. We apply this approach to a low-order model of the wind-driven ocean circulation, subject to both periodic and aperiodic forcing, and show how TMVs emerge or vanish over time in nonautonomous settings. The analysis reveals that TMVs allow for a qualitatively new understanding of variability in complex systems where linear modes fail to describe the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous phase locking in a broad-area semiconductor laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broad-area semiconductor lasers are employed in many high-power applications, however, their spatio-temporal dynamics is complex and intrinsically unstable due to the interaction of several transverse lasing modes. A dynamical and spatio-spectral analysis with ultra-high resolution of commercial broad-area lasers reveals multiplets of phase-locked first- and second-order transverse modes that are spontaneously created by the nonlinear dynamics for a wide range of operation parameters. Phase locking between modes of different transverse order is demonstrated by comparing the linewidths of the lasing modes to that of their beat note and by a direct measurement of their phase fluctuation correlations. The spontaneous phase locking is unexpected since the overall dynamics is unstable and the system lacks any intentional feature to induce locking. This partially synchronized dynamical state with groups of synchronized and unsynchronized laser modes coexisting is similar to what is called a chimera state in networks of coupled oscillators, hence indicating that such states may exist in a wider range of systems than previously assumed. Moreover, some of the phase-locked modes do not exist on the passive-cavity level, but are created by the nonlinear dynamics, an effect not previously observed in the context of partially synchronized laser modes.</description>
