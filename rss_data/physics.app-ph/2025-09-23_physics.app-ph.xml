      <title>LightCode: Compiling LLM Inference for Photonic-Electronic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for low-latency, energy-efficient inference in large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed interest in heterogeneous architectures. While GPUs remain dominant, they are poorly suited for integration with emerging domain-specific accelerators like the Photonic Tensor Units (PTUs), which offer low-power, high-throughput linear computation. This motivates hybrid compilation strategies that combine photonic and electronic resources. We present LightCode, a compiler framework and simulator for mapping LLM inference workloads across hybrid photonic-electronic systems. LightCode introduces the Stacked Graph, an intermediate representation that encodes multiple hardware-specific realizations of each tensor operation. Hardware assignment is formulated as a constrained subgraph selection problem optimized for latency or energy under parametric cost models. We evaluate LightCode on the prefill stage of GPT-2 and Llama-7B showing that under our workload and hardware assumptions, (i) Photonic hardware reduced energy by up to 50% in our simulated workloads at maximum sequence length; (ii) multiplexing and assignment strategy yielded latency improvements exceeding 10x; and (iii) Optimizing for latency or energy resulted in distinct hardware mappings in our simulations. LightCode offers a module, foundational framework and simulator for compiling LLMs to emerging photonic accelerators.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Insights into the Switching Mechanisms of RRAM Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing energy demands of information and communication technologies, driven by data-intensive computing and the von Neumann bottleneck, underscore the need for energy-efficient alternatives. Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices have emerged as promising candidates for beyond von Neumann computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic computing, offering voltage-history-dependent switching that mimics synaptic and neural behaviors. Atomic-scale mechanisms, such as defect-driven filament formation and ionic transport, govern these switching processes. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of Tantalum Oxide based RRAM devices featuring both oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient switching layers. We analyze the dominant conduction mechanisms underpinning resistive switching and systematically evaluate how oxygen stoichiometry influences device behavior. Leveraging a bottom-up design methodology, we link material composition to electrical performance metrics-such as endurance, cycle-to-cycle variability, and multilevel resistance states-providing actionable guidelines for optimizing RRAM architectures for energy-efficient memory and computing applications.</description>

      <title>Criticality of a stochastic modern Hopfield network model with exponential interaction function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hopfield network (HN) is a classical model of associative memory whose dynamics are closely related to the Ising spin system with 2-body interactions. Stored patterns are encoded as minima of an energy function shaped by a Hebbian learning rule, and retrieval corresponds to convergence towards these minima. Modern Hopfield Networks (MHNs) introduce p-body interactions among neurons with p greater than 2 and, more recently, also exponential interaction functions, which significantly improve network's storing and retrieval capacity. While the criticality of HNs and p-body MHNs were extensively studied since the 1980s, the investigation of critical behavior in exponential MHNs is still in its early stages. Here, we study a stochastic exponential MHN (SMHN) with a multiplicative salt-and-pepper noise. While taking the noise probability p as control parameter, the average overlap parameter Q and a diffusion scaling H are taken as order parameters. In particular, H is related to the time correlation features of the network, with H greater than 0.5 signaling the emergence of persistent time memory. We found the emergence of a critical transition in both Q and H, with the critical noise level weakly decreasing as the load N increases. Notably, for each load N, the diffusion scaling H highlights a transition between a sub- and a super-critical regime, both with short-range correlated dynamics. Conversely, the critical regime, which is found in the range of p around 0.23-0.3, displays a long-range correlated dynamics with highly persistent temporal memory marked by the high value H around 1.3.</description>

      <title>Bilayer Cuprate Antiferromagnets Enable Programmable Cavity Optomagnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid platforms that couple microwave photons to collective spin excitations offer promising routes for coherent information processing, yet conventional magnets face inherent trade-offs among coupling strength, coherence, and tunability. We demonstrate that bilayer cuprate antiferromagnets, exemplified by YBa2Cu3O6+x, provide an alternative approach enabled by their unique magnon spectrum. Using a neutron-constrained bilayer spin model, we obtain the complete Gamma-point spectrum and identify an in-plane acoustic alpha mode that remains gapless and Zeeman-linear, alongside an in-plane optical beta mode stabilized by weak anisotropy whose frequency can be tuned from the gigahertz to terahertz range. When coupled to a single-mode microwave cavity, these modes create two distinct channels with a magnetically tunable alpha-photon interaction and a nearly field-independent beta-photon interaction. This asymmetric behavior enables continuous, single-parameter control spanning from dispersive to strong coupling regimes. In the dispersive limit, our analysis reveals cavity-mediated magnon-magnon coupling, while near triple resonance the normal modes reorganize into bright and dark superpositions governed by a single collective energy scale. The calculated transmission exhibits vacuum-Rabi splittings, dispersive shifts, and Fano-like lineshapes that provide concrete experimental benchmarks and suggest potential for programmable filtering and coherent state transfer across the gigahertz-terahertz frequency range if realized experimentally with suitable interfaces.</description>

      <title>Non-Equatorial Uniform-Stress Space Elevators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equatorial space elevators are interesting as they give more freedom for anchor location, avoid the highly occupied geosynchronous orbit and the areas of highest radiation in the Van Allen belts. We review the static equation for a uniform-stress tether, and use it to study the tapering of a uniform-stress tether in a general potential field. We then focus on a rotating coulomb potential and study the range of latitudes that are allowed for a uniform-stress space elevator. Finally, we look at a few practical issues that are raised by non-equatorial space elevators.</description>

      <title>Impact of metallographic polishing on the RF properties of Niobium for SRF applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities made of Niobium is tied to the quality of their inner surfaces exposed to the radio frequency (RF) waves. Future superconducting particle accelerators, because of their dimensions or the unprecedented stringent technical requirements, require the development of innovative surface processing techniques to improve processing reliability and if possible ecological footprint and cost, compared to conventional chemical processes. Metallographic polishing (MP) has emerged as a promising polishing technology to address these challenges. Previous studies focused on the characterization of the processed material surface at room temperature in the absence of RF waves. However, the evaluation of material properties, such as surface resistance under RF, at cryogenic temperature has failed, primarily due to the unavailability of devices capable of achieving the necessary resolution in the nanohm range. To overcome this limitation, a quadrupole resonator (QPR) has been utilized. The RF results demonstrate that the MP polishing, developed to preserve a high-quality niobium surface with very low surface resistance, is highly effective compared to conventional polishing. This conclusion is further supported by topography and microstructural analysis of the QPR top-hat samples, which revealed the clear superiority of the metallographic approach.</description>

      <title>From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of &lt;10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts</description>

      <title>Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise as a Robust Diagnostic for Chiral, Helical and Trivial Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise provides a sensitive, practical probe for distinguishing chiral edge modes from topological helical and trivial (non-topological) helical edge transport. Measured under zero-current conditions, $\Delta_T$ noise reveals contrasts that conventional conductance measurements typically miss. Crucially, $\Delta_T$ requires no external energy input in the form of an applied voltage bias, yet encodes the same intrinsic information that shot noise yields in the zero-temperature, finite-bias limit, without the distorting effects of Joule heating. This absence of bias-induced heating makes $\Delta_T$ noise both more precise and more reliable than conventional shot-noise approaches. Moreover, the diagnostic power of $\Delta_T$ noise persists at finite frequencies $\omega$ too. The frequency-dependent signal $\Delta_{T}(\omega)$ exhibits distinctive spectral signatures (including sign changes) that further enhance its utility as an experimentally accessible fingerprint of edge-mode topology.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Photonic Crystal Cavities with Controllable Far-Field Numerical Aperture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities confine light to subwavelength volumes, enabling strong light-matter interactions for applications in low-power photonics, opto-electronics, nonlinear optics, and quantum information. These applications demand cavities that combine high quality factors, low mode volumes, and high coupling efficiencies. However, optimizing across these metrics requires exploring a large design space, motivating the use of inverse design strategies. Previous inverse design efforts targeted high quality factors and low mode volumes, sacrificing the coupling efficiency or lacking the ability to precisely control the far-field radiation pattern. In this work, we present an inverse design framework that simultaneously optimizes cavity quality factor and far-field numerical aperture, both specified as design targets. Using this method, we design L3 photonic crystal cavities, with different far-field numerical apertures, in the visible wavelength and fabricate them in silicon nitride. Photoluminescence measurements confirm experimental control of the far-field numerical aperture and reveal a 28-fold and 3.9-fold improvement in the coupling efficiency and quality factor respectively when compared to the standard L3 cavity. Disorder analysis further shows that the designs retain significant performance despite nanofabrication imperfections. Our work demonstrates a versatile inverse design framework for multi-objective optimization of photonic crystal cavities to attain high quality factors and coupling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tunneling magnetoresistance in a junction made of $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of a bilayer system made of $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where $X=d,g,i$ corresponds to altermagnets. A universal analytic formula is derived for the TMR ratio. It is proportional to $\left\vert J\right\vert /\left( N_{X}\Gamma \right) $ for small $\Gamma $, where $N_{X}$ is the number of the nodes of the $X$% -wave magnet, $J$ is the strength of the $X$-wave magnet, and $\Gamma $ is the self-energy. It is contrasted with the TMR ratio made of ferromagnets, where it is proportional to $J^{2}/\Gamma ^{2}$ for small $\Gamma $. Therefore, the TMR ratio is larger in ferromagnets for $\left\vert J\right\vert &gt;\Gamma $. However, the $X$-wave magnets are expected to achieve high-speed and ultra-dense memory owing to the zero net magnetization.</description>

      <title>Protection of metal interfaces against hydrogen-assisted cracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling a hydrogen economy requires the development of materials resistant to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). More than 100 years of research have led to several mechanisms and models describing how hydrogen interacts with lattice defects and leads to mechanical property degradation. However, solutions to protect materials from hydrogen are still scarce. Here, we investigate the role of interstitial solutes in protecting critical crystalline defects sensitive to hydrogen. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon in solid solutions at grain boundaries can efficiently prevent hydrogen segregation. We then realized this interface protection concept on martensitic steel, a material strongly prone to HE, by doping the most sensitive interfaces with different concentrations of boron and carbon. This segregation, in addition to stress relaxations, critically reduced the hydrogen ingress by half, leading to an unprecedented resistance against HE. This tailored interstitial segregation strategy can be extended to other metallic materials susceptible to hydrogen-induced interfacial failure</description>

      <title>Morphologies of a sagging elastica with intrinsic sensing and actuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphology of a slender soft-robot can be modified by sensing its shape via sensors and exerting moments via actuators embedded along its body. The actuating moments required to morph these soft-robots to a desired shape are often difficult to compute due to the geometric non-linearity associated with the structure, the errors in modeling the experimental system, and the limitations in sensing and feedback/actuation capabilities. In this article, we explore the effect of a simple feedback strategy (actuation being proportional to the sensed curvature) on the shape of a soft-robot, modeled as an elastica. The finite number of sensors and actuators, often seen in experiments, is captured in the model via filters of specified widths. Using proportional feedback, we study the simple task of straightening the device by compensating for the sagging introduced by its self-weight. The device undergoes a hierarchy of morphological instabilities defined in the phase-space given by the gravito-bending number, non-dimensional sensing/feedback gain, and the scaled width of the filter. For complex shape-morphing tasks, given a perfect model of the device with limited sensing and actuating capabilities, we find that a trade-off arises (set by the sensor spacing &amp; actuator size) between capturing the long and short wavelength features. We show that the error in shape-morphing is minimal for a fixed filter width when we choose an appropriate actuating gain (whose magnitude goes as a square of the filter width). Our model provides a quantitative lens to study and design slender soft devices with limited sensing and actuating capabilities for complex maneuvering applications.</description>

Abstract: Entangled networks are ubiquitous in tissues, polymers, and fabrics. However, their mechanics remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the topological constraints at the network level. Here, we develop a mathematical framework that models entangled networks as graphs, capturing topological constraints of entanglements. We prove that entanglements reduce system energy by enabling uniform tension along chains crossing entanglements and by redistributing stress through sliding. Under this framework, we study elasticity and fracture, validated by experiments on entangled fabrics and hydrogels. For elasticity, entanglements increase strength by enabling stress homogeneity in the network. For fracture, entanglements enhance toughness by mitigating stress concentration around crack tips. We discover counterintuitive physical laws governing crack-tip stretch during crack opening: stress deconcentration at small deformation, constitutive-law independence at intermediate deformation, and linear scaling at large deformation. This framework establishes fundamental principles of linking topology to mechanics of entangled networks and offers a foundational tool for designing reconfigurable materials.</description>

      <title>Rapid muon tomography for border security</title>

Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.</description>

      <title>A 5.9 GHz Sezawa SAW Acoustic Delay Line Based on Al0.6Sc0.4N-on-Sapphire with Propagation Q-factor &gt; 3,000</title>

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line based on a Scandium alloyed aluminum nitride (AlScN)-on-sapphire platform operating at 5.9 GHz with an exceptionally high acoustic propagation Q-factor. An 800 nm AlScN thin film with 40% scandium alloying concentration was deposited on a thick sapphire substrate to achieve strong acoustic energy confinement and large electromechanical coupling effect, thereby minimizing the insertion loss (IL) and propagation loss (PL) of the acoustic delay line (ADL). The proposed ADL was designed to operate in the Sezawa mode using a Single-Phase Unidirectional Transducer (SPUDT) electrode configuration for better unidirectionality. The fabricated ADLs with different delay lengths, after conjugate matching, exhibited delay times spanning 13 to 214 ns and IL ranging from 7.6 to 18.3 dB. The extracted PL reached as low as 9.2 dB/mm at 5.9 GHz, with a group velocity (v_g) of around 5,779 m/s. Based on these results, the proposed ADLs exhibit a high acoustic propagation Q-factor of 3,044. These findings highlight the potential of AlScN-on-sapphire platforms for high operational frequency, low-loss SAW ADL devices in advanced RF applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-NeuroMem: A Low-Power Neuromorphic Associative Memory Design Based on Spintronic Devices</title>

Abstract: Biologically-inspired computing models have made significant progress in recent years, but the conventional von Neumann architecture is inefficient for the large-scale matrix operations and massive parallelism required by these models. This paper presents Spin-NeuroMem, a low-power circuit design of Hopfield network for the function of associative memory. Spin-NeuroMem is equipped with energy-efficient spintronic synapses which utilize magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to store weight matrices of multiple associative memories. The proposed synapse design achieves as low as 17.4% power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art synapse designs. Spin-NeuroMem also encompasses a novel voltage converter with a 53.3% reduction in transistor usage for effective Hopfield network computation. In addition, we propose an associative memory simulator for the first time, which achieves a 5Mx speedup with a comparable associative memory effect. By harnessing the potential of spintronic devices, this work paves the way for the development of energy-efficient and scalable neuromorphic computing systems.</description>

Abstract: Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) have been used in spintronic applications to decrease the magnetic field or the electric current required to act on the magnetization. A common belief is that a SAW alone cannot achieve a directed magnetic switching in a device without an assisting magnetic field or electric current. In this work, we demonstrate magnetic domain wall motion driven solely by an acoustic wave. Using XMCD-PEEM, we show extensive evidence of SAW-induced and field-free magnetic domain wall motion (DW) in the direction of the wave propagation. Our micromagnetic simulations reveal a mechanism that allows the SAW to transfer linear momentum to the DW. Experimentally, the largest DW average velocity measured was ~12 m/s, although our simulations predict that velocities in the range of 100 m/s could be attained. This new mechanism opens the door to designing innovative spintronic devices where the magnetization can be controlled exclusively by an acoustic wave.</description>

Abstract: Dissipative Kerr soliton microcombs have inspired various intriguing applications such as spectroscopy, ranging, telecommunication, and high purity microwave generation. Mechanically actuated soliton microcombs provide enhanced controllability and flexibility for Kerr solitons, thus enabling technological progress to be made on such practical applications. Here, we present architectures for coherent dual-comb techniques and ultralow-noise microwave generation by exploiting the mechanical actuation of ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonators. By unifying a pump laser, we demonstrate highly coherent dual-soliton combs using distinct resonators with slightly different repetition rates. We also report significant phase noise reduction achieved by directly generating Kerr solitons from a sub-Hz linewidth ultrastable laser. This study paves the way for further advancements in a wide variety of applications based on Kerr soliton microcombs.</description>

      <title>A magnetically levitated conducting rotor with ultra-low rotational damping circumventing eddy loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Levitation of macroscopic objects in a vacuum is key towards the development of high-precision inertial sensors and pressure sensors, as well as towards the fundamental studies of quantum mechanics and its relation to gravity. Diamagnetic levitation offers a passive method at room temperature to isolate macroscopic objects in vacuum environments, yet eddy current damping remains a critical limitation for electrically conductive materials. We show that there are situations where the motion of conductors in magnetic fields does not, in principle, produce eddy damping, and demonstrate an electrically conducting rotor diamagnetically levitated in an axially symmetric magnetic field in a high vacuum. Experimental measurements and finite-element simulations reveal gas collision damping as the dominant loss mechanism at high pressures, while residual eddy damping, which arises from symmetry-breaking factors such as platform tilt or material imperfections, dominates at low pressures. The conclusion is supported by an analytic proof and an analytic example of zero steady current density for a rotating conductor in a magnetic field. This demonstrates a macroscopic levitated rotor with extremely low rotational damping and paves the way to fully suppress rotor damping, enabling ultra-low-loss rotors for gyroscopes, pressure sensing, and fundamental physics tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AMTIR-1 chalcogenide glass has shown its potential for use in thermal imaging systems owing to its low refractive index, thermal resistance and high transparency across the infrared wavelength regime. Here we report a millimeter-scale high-Q whispering gallery mode microresonator made of AMTIR-1. The recorded Q-factor has reached $1.2\times10^7$ at 1550 nm, which is almost two-orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values. We characterize the thermal properties, where low thermal conductivity plays an important role in thermal resonance tuning. We further show that AMTIR-1 resonators support anomalous dispersion as well as a low absorption coefficient near the 7~\textmu m wavelength band, thus offering the possibility of providing suitable platforms for mid-infrared, long-wave infrared nonlinear optics including microresonator frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Coercive Field Reduction in Ultra-thin Al1-XScXN via Interfacial Engineering with a Scandium Electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to high remnant polarization compared with Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 and doped-HfO2 material systems, as well as their fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As AlScN films are thinned to 10 nm thickness, coercive field has been shown to substantially increase, which hinders low voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase with scaling and improves ferroelectric performance. Here, we demonstrate robust ferroelectricity in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, the difference in dynamic switching behavior over a decade of frequency was evaluated by applying the KAI model. At frequencies lower than 16.7 kHz, the capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents of 0.030 and 0.028, indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent of 0.063, indicating a stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.030, suggesting a lower frequency dependence during faster switching scenarios. The Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction technique was selected to measure the strain difference in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, providing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain and switching behavior in ultra-thin film systems.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5 x 10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in very low and low lunar orbits (vLLO/LLO), in elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs), at the Earth-Moon L1 point, and in near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are sufficient to achieve 5 x 10^{-18} fractional stability for deep cislunar regimes (e.g., NRHO, Earth-Moon L1), supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation; near-surface and vLLO realizations generally require a much higher spherical-harmonic degree, l_max &gt;= 300, to meet the same stability goal. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>
