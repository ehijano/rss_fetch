      <title>A Run on Fossil Fuel? Climate Change and Transition Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the dynamic, general equilibrium implications of climate-change-linked transition risk on macroeconomic outcomes and asset prices. Climate-change-linked expectations of fossil fuel restrictions can produce a ``run on fossil fuels'' with accelerated production and decreasing spot prices, or a ``reverse run'' with restrained production and increased spot prices. The response depends on the expected economic consequences of the anticipated transition shock, and existing climate policies. Fossil fuel firm prices decrease in each case. I use a novel empirical measure of innovations in climate-related transition risk likelihood to show that dynamic empirical responses are consistent with a ``run on fossil fuel.''</description>

      <title>Tax Policy Handbook for Crypto Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Financial system has witnessed rapid technological changes. The rise of Bitcoin and other crypto assets based on Distributed Ledger Technology mark a fundamental change in the way people transact and transmit value over a decentralized network, spread across geographies. This has created regulatory and tax policy blind spots, as governments and tax administrations take time to understand and provide policy responses to this innovative, revolutionary, and fast-paced technology. Due to the breakneck speed of innovation in blockchain technology and advent of Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the Metaverse, it is unlikely that the policy interventions and guidance by regulatory authorities or tax administrations would be ahead or in sync with the pace of innovation. This paper tries to explain the principles on which crypto assets function, their underlying technology and relates them to the tax issues and taxable events which arise within this ecosystem. It also provides instances of tax and regulatory policy responses already in effect in various jurisdictions, including the recent changes in reporting standards by the FATF and the OECD. This paper tries to explain the rationale behind existing laws and policies and the challenges in their implementation. It also attempts to present a ballpark estimate of tax potential of this asset class and suggests creation of global public digital infrastructure that can address issues related to pseudonymity and extra-territoriality. The paper analyses both direct and indirect taxation issues related to crypto assets and discusses more recent aspects like proof-of-stake and maximal extractable value in greater detail.</description>

      <title>Global Stock Market Volatility Forecasting Incorporating Dynamic Graphs and All Trading Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a global stock market volatility forecasting model that enhances forecasting accuracy and practical utility in real-world financial decision-making by integrating dynamic graph structures and encompassing the union of active trading days of different stock markets. The model employs a spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) architecture to capture the volatility spillover effect, where shocks in one market spread to others through the interconnective global economy. By calculating the volatility spillover index to depict the volatility network as graphs, the model effectively mirrors the volatility dynamics for the chosen stock market indices. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model surpasses the benchmark model in all forecasting scenarios and is shown to be sensitive to the underlying volatility interrelationships.</description>
