      <title>Pattern formation and global analysis of a systematically reduced plant model in dryland environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into a systematically reduced plant system proposed by Ja\"ibi et al. [Phys. D, 2020] in arid area. They used the method of geometric singular perturbation to study the existence of abundant orbits. Instead, we deliberate the stability and distributed patterns of this system. For a non-diffusive scenario for the model, we scrutinize the local and global stability of equilibria and derive conditions for the existence or non-existence of the limit cycle. The bifurcation behaviors are also explored. For the spatial model, we investigate Hopf, Turing, Hopf-Turing, Turing-Turing bifurcations. Specially, the evolution process from periodic solutions to spatially nonconstant steady states is observed near the Hopf-Turing bifurcation point. And mixed nonconstant steady states near the Turing-Turing bifurcation point are observed. Furthermore, it's found that there exist gap, spot, stripe and mixed patterns. The seed-dispersal rate enables the transformation of pattern structures. Reasonable control of system parameters may prevent desertification from occurring.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Phase-Field Modeling of Rapid Alloy Solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [Ji et al., PRL 2023]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity framework can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. Furthermore, 3D simulations demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Weak Diffusive Stability of Roll Solutions at the Zigzag Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roll solutions at the zigzag boundary, typically selected by patterns and defects in numerical simulations, are shown to be nonlinearly stable. This result also serves as an example that linear decay weaker than the classical diffusive decay, together with quadratic nonlinearity, still gives nonlinear stability of spatially periodic patterns. Linear analysis reveals that, instead of the classical $t^{-1}$ diffusive decay rate, small perturbations of roll solutions at the zigzag boundary decay with a $t^{-3/4}$ rate along with time, due to the degeneracy of the quadratic term of the continuation of the translational mode of the linearized operator in the Bloch-Fourier spaces. The nonlinear stability proof is based on a decomposition of the neutral translational mode and the faster decaying modes in the Bloch-Fourier space, and a fixed-point argument, demonstrating the irrelevancy of the nonlinear terms.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and global order controls bifurcations in nonreciprocal systems without a conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in the short-range interacting nonreciprocal Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Long-lived states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady states via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in nonreciprocal matter without conservation laws.</description>
