      <title>Enhancing polynomial approximation of continuous functions by composition with homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enhance the approximation capabilities of algebraic polynomials by composing them with homeomorphisms. This composition yields families of functions that remain dense in the space of continuous functions, while enabling more accurate approximations. For univariate continuous functions exhibiting a finite number of local extrema, we prove that there exist a polynomial of finite degree and a homeomorphism whose composition approximates the target function to arbitrary accuracy. The construction is especially relevant for multivariate approximation problems, where standard numerical methods often suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To support our theoretical results, we investigate both regression tasks and the construction of molecular potential-energy surfaces, parametrizing the underlying homeomorphism using invertible neural networks. The numerical experiments show strong agreement with our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Offline Maximizing Minimally Invasive Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for Reduced Order Modeling of $S_n$ Radiation Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic solutions to the Sn transport equation can be computationally expensive to calculate. Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide an efficient means of approximating the Full Order Model (FOM) solution. We propose a novel approach for constructing ROMs of the Sn radiation transport equation, Offline Maximizing Minimally Invasive (OMMI) Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). POD uses snapshot data to build a reduced basis, which is then used to project the FOM. Minimally Invasive POD leverages the sweep infrastructure within deterministic Sn transport solvers to construct the reduced linear system, even though the FOM linear system is never directly assembled. OMMI-POD extends Minimally Invasive POD by performing transport sweeps offline, thereby maximizing the potential speedup. It achieves this by generating a library of reduced systems from a training set, which is then interpolated in the online stage to provide a rapid approximate solution to the Sn transport equation. The model's performance is evaluated on a multigroup 2-D test problem, demonstrating low error and a 1600-fold speedup over the full order model.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem for the one-phase Stefan problem with varying melting temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article is dedicated to the forward and backward solution of a transient one-phase Stefan problem. In the forward problem, we compute the evolution of the initial domain for a Stefan problem where the melting temperature varies over time. This occurs in practice, for example, when the pressure in the external space changes in time. In the corresponding backward problem, we then reconstruct the time-dependent melting temperature from the knowledge of the evolving geometry. We develop respective numerical algorithms using a moving mesh finite element method and provide numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiple Scale Methods For Optimization Of Discretized Continuous Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiscale optimization framework for problems over a space of Lipschitz continuous functions is developed. The method solves a coarse-grid discretization followed by linear interpolation to warm-start project gradient descent on progressively finer grids. Greedy and lazy variants are analyzed and convergence guarantees are derived that show the multiscale approach achieves provably tighter error bounds at lower computational cost than single-scale optimization. The analysis extends to any base algorithm with iterate convergence at a fixed rate. Constraint modification techniques preserve feasibility across scales. Numerical experiments on probability density estimation problems, including geological data, demonstrate speedups of an order of magnitude or better.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Wavelet-Galerkin Modelling of Heat Conduction in Heterogeneous Composite Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an adaptive wavelet Galerkin method for transient heat conduction in heterogeneous composite materials. The approach combines multiresolution wavelet bases with an implicit time discretization to efficiently resolve sharp temperature gradients near material interfaces and boundary layers. Adaptive refinement is driven by wavelet coefficients, significantly reducing the number of degrees of freedom compared to uniform discretizations. Numerical examples demonstrate accurate resolution of layered, inclusion-based, and functionally graded composites with improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Weighted Group Lasso for a static EEG problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the weighted Group Lasso formulation for the static inverse electroencephalography (EEG) problem, aiming at reconstructing the unknown underlying neuronal sources from voltage measurements on the scalp. By modelling the three orthogonal dipole components at each location as a single coherent group, we demonstrate that depth bias and orientation bias can be effectively mitigated through the proposed regularization framework. On the theoretical front, we provide concise recovery guarantees for both single and multiple group sources. Our numerical experiments highlight that while theoretical bounds hold for a broad range of weight definitions, the practical reconstruction quality, for cases not covered by the theory, depends significantly on the specific weighting strategy employed. Specifically, employing a truncated Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse for the involved weighting matrix gives a small Dipole Localization Error (DLE). The proposed method offers a robust approach for inverse EEG problems, enabling improved spatial accuracy and a more physiologically realistic reconstruction of neural activity.</description>

      <title>Efficient LU factorization exploiting direct-indirect Burton-Miller equation for Helmholtz transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a direct-indirect mixed Burton-Miller boundary integral equation for solving Helmholtz scattering problems with transmissive scatterers. The proposed formulation has three unknowns, one more than the number of unknowns for the ordinary formulation. However, we can construct efficient numerical solvers based on LU factorization by exploiting the sparse alignment of the boundary integral operators of the proposed formulation. Numerical examples demonstrate that the direct solver based on the proposed formulation is approximately 40% faster than the ordinary formulation when the LU-factorization-based solver is used. In addition, the proposed formulation is applied to a fast direct solver employing LU factorization in its algorithm. In the application to the fast direct solver, the proxy method with a weak admissibility low-rank approximation is developed. The speedup achieved using the proposed formulation is also shown to be effective in finding nonlinear eigenvalues, which are related to the uniqueness of the solution, in boundary value problems. Furthermore, the well-posedness of the proposed boundary integral equation is established for scatterers with boundaries of class $C^2$, using the mapping property of boundary integral operators in H\"older space.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a finite element method for second order uniformly elliptic PDEs in non-divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose one finite element method for both second order linear uniformly elliptic PDE in non-divergence form and the elliptic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. For the linear elliptic PDE in non-divergence form, we consider two scenarios of the matrix coefficient matrix $A$. One is $A$ is uniformly continuous. The other is $A$ is discontinuous but $\gamma A$ is dominated by $I_{d}$ where $\gamma$ is a positive weight function.
  We prove that optimal convergence in discrete $W^{2,p}$-norm of the numerical approximation to the strong solution for $1&lt;p\leq 2$ on convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ($d=2,3$). If the domain is a two dimensional non-convex polygon, $p$ is valid in a neighbourhood of $\frac{4}{3}$. We also prove the well-posedness of strong solution in $W^{2,p}(\Omega)$ for both linear elliptic PDE in non-divergence form and the HJB equation for $1&lt; p \leq 2$ on convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ($d=2,3$) and for $p$ in an open interval starting from $1$ and including $\frac{4}{3}$ on two dimensional non-convex polygon. Furthermore, we relax the assumptions on the continuity of coefficients of the HJB equation, which have been widely used in literature.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving Variational Multiscale Stabilization of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Variational Multiscale Stabilization (VMS) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations that utilizes the Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) framework. The FEEC framework preserves the geometric and topological structure of continuous spaces and PDEs in the discrete spaces and model, and helps build stable and convergent discretizations. For the Navier-Stokes equations, this structure is encoded in the de Rham complex. In this work, we consider the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation discretized within the FEEC framework. We model the effect of the unresolved scales on the finite-dimensional solution by introducing appropriate fine-scale governing equations, which we also discretize using the FEEC approach. This preserves the structure of the continuous problem in both the coarse- and fine-scale solutions; for instance, both the coarse- and fine-scale velocities are pointwise incompressible. We demonstrate that the resulting formulation is residual-based, energetically stable, and optimally convergent. Moreover, our fine-scale model provides an efficient computational approach: by decoupling fine-scale problems across elements, they can be solved in parallel. In fact, the fine-scale equations can be eliminated during matrix assembly, leading to a VMS formulation in which the problem size is governed solely by the coarse-scale discretization. Finally, the proposed formulation applies to both the lowest regularity discretizations of the de Rham complex and high-regularity isogeometric discretizations. We validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, simulating both steady-, unsteady-, viscous-, and inviscid-flow problems. These tests show that the stabilized solutions are qualitatively better than the unstabilized ones, converge at optimal rates, and, as the mesh is refined, the stabilization is asymptotically turned off.</description>

      <title>An Additively Preconditioned Trust Region Strategy for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning, especially the training of deep neural networks, depends on solving large-scale, highly nonconvex optimization problems, whose objective function exhibit a rough landscape. Motivated by the success of parallel preconditioners in the context of Krylov methods for large scale linear systems, we introduce a novel nonlinearly preconditioned Trust-Region method that makes use of an additive Schwarz correction at each minimization step, thereby accelerating convergence.
  More precisely, we propose a variant of the Additively Preconditioned Trust-Region Strategy (APTS), which combines a right-preconditioned additive Schwarz framework with a classical Trust-Region algorithm. By decomposing the parameter space into sub-domains, APTS solves local non-linear sub-problems in parallel and assembles their corrections additively. The resulting method not only shows fast convergence; due to the underlying Trust-Region strategy, it furthermore largely obviates the need for hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Separation-free exponential fitting with structured noise, with applications to inverse problems in parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the recovery of exponents and amplitudes of an exponential sum, where the exponents $\left\{\lambda_n \right\}_{n=1}^{N_1}$ are the first $N_1$ eigenvalues of a Sturm-Liouville operator, from finitely many measurements subject to measurement noise. This inverse problem is extremely ill-conditioned when the noise is arbitrary and unstructured. Surprisingly, however, the extreme ill-conditioning exhibited by this problem disappears when considering a \emph{structured} noise term, taken as an exponential sum with exponents given by the subsequent eigenvalues $\left\{\lambda_n \right\}_{n=N_1+1}^{N_1+N_2}$ of the Sturm-Liouville operator, multiplied by a noise magnitude parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. In this case, we rigorously show that the exponents and amplitudes can be recovered with super-exponential accuracy: we both prove the theoretical result and show that it can be achieved numerically by a specific algorithm. By leveraging recent results on the mathematical theory of super-resolution, we show in this paper that the classical Prony's method attains the analytic optimal error decay also in the ``separation-free'' regime where $\lambda_n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, thereby extending the applicability of Prony's method to new settings. As an application of our theoretical analysis, we show that the approximated eigenvalues obtained by our method can be used to recover an unknown potential in a linear reaction-diffusion equation from discrete solution traces.</description>

      <title>Reducing Training Complexity in Empirical Quadrature-Based Model Reduction via Structured Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model order reduction seeks to approximate large-scale dynamical systems by lower-dimensional reduced models. For linear systems, a small reduced dimension directly translates into low computational cost, ensuring online efficiency. This property does not generally hold for nonlinear systems, where an additional approximation of nonlinear terms -- known as complexity reduction -- is required. To achieve online efficiency, empirical quadrature and cell-based empirical cubature are among the most effective complexity reduction techniques. However, existing offline training algorithms can be prohibitively expensive because they operate on raw snapshot data of all nonlinear integrands associated with the reduced model. In this paper, we introduce a preprocessing approach based on a specific structured compression of the training data. Its key feature is that it scales only with the number of collected snapshots, rather than additionally with the reduced model dimension. Overall, this yields roughly an order-of-magnitude reduction in offline computational cost and memory requirements, thereby enabling the application of the complexity reduction methods to larger-scale problems. Accuracy is preserved, as indicated by our error analysis and demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Parameter Estimation for the LPLSP Framework: A Rapid Approach to Reduced-Order Modeling for Transient Thermal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an ensemble parameter estimation framework that enables the Lumped Parameter Linear Superposition (LPLSP) method to generate reduced order thermal models from a single transient dataset. Unlike earlier implementations that relied on multiple parametric simulations to excite each heat source independently, the proposed approach simultaneously identifies all model coefficients using fully transient excitations. Two estimation strategies namely rank-reduction and two-stage decomposition are developed to further reduce computational cost and improve scalability for larger systems. The proposed strategies yield ROMs with mean temperature-prediction errors within 5% of CFD simulations while reducing model-development times to O(10^0 s)-O(10^1 s). Once constructed, the ROM evaluates new transient operating conditions in O(10^0 s), enabling rapid thermal analysis and enabling automated generation of digital twins for both simulated and physical systems.</description>

      <title>On the constants in inverse trace inequalities for polynomials orthogonal to lower-order subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive sharp, explicit constants in inverse trace inequalities for polynomial functions belonging to $\mathbb{P}_p(T)$ (polynomial space with total degree $p$) that are orthogonal to the lower-order subspace $\mathbb{P}_n(T)$, $n\leq p$, where $T$ denotes a $d$-dimensional simplex. The proofs rely on orthogonal polynomial expansions on reference simplices and on a careful analysis of the eigenvalues of the relevant blocks of the face mass matrices, following the arguments developed in [9]. These results are very useful in the $hp$-analysis of the hybrid Galerkin methods, e.g. hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods, hybrid high-order methods, etc.</description>

      <title>Inverse obstacle scattering regularized by the tangent-point energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the so-called tangent-point energy as Tikhonov regularizer for ill-conditioned inverse scattering problems in 3D. The tangent-point energy is a self-avoiding functional on the space of embedded surfaces that also penalizes surface roughness. Moreover, it features nice compactness and continuity properties. These allow us to show the well-posedness of the regularized problems and the convergence of the regularized solutions to the true solution in the limit of vanishing noise level. We also provide a reconstruction algorithm of iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton type. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is numerically feasible and effective in producing reconstructions of unprecedented quality.</description>

      <title>Co-simulation errors due to step size changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two simulation units in a continuous-time co-simulation are connected via some variable $q$, and both simulation units have an internal state which represents the time integral of $q$, there will generally be a discrepancy between those states due to extrapolation errors. Normally, such extrapolation errors diminish if the macro time step size is reduced. Here we show that, under certain circumstances, step size changes can cause such discrepancies to increase even when the change is towards smaller steps.</description>

      <title>Adaptive digital twins for predictive decision-making: Online Bayesian learning of transition dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows how adaptivity can enhance value realization of digital twins in civil engineering. We focus on adapting the state transition models within digital twins represented through probabilistic graphical models. The bi-directional interaction between the physical and virtual domains is modeled using dynamic Bayesian networks. By treating state transition probabilities as random variables endowed with conjugate priors, we enable hierarchical online learning of transition dynamics from a state to another through effortless Bayesian updates. We provide the mathematical framework to account for a larger class of distributions with respect to the current literature. To compute dynamic policies with precision updates we solve parametric Markov decision processes through reinforcement learning. The proposed adaptive digital twin framework enjoys enhanced personalization, increased robustness, and improved cost-effectiveness. We assess our approach on a case study involving structural health monitoring and maintenance planning of a railway bridge.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing symplecticity in simulations of high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrals of the Liouville $1$-form, known as the first Poincar\'e integral invariant, provide a computable figure of merit for monitoring the conservation of symplecticity in the numerical integration of Hamiltonian systems. These integrals may be approximated with spectral convergence in the number of sample points, limited only by the regularity of the Hamiltonian. We devise a numerical integral invariant diagnostic for checking preservation of symplecticity in particle-in-cell (PIC) kinetic plasma simulation codes. As a first application of this diagnostic tool, we check the preservation of symplecticity in symplectic electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) methods. Surprisingly, such PIC methods fail to have symplectic time-advance maps if the charge is interpolated to the grid using linear shape functions, as is commonly done in practice. It is found that at least quadratic interpolation is needed for a structure-preserving PIC method to truly be symplectic.</description>

      <title>Frozen Gaussian sampling algorithms for simulating Markovian open quantum systems in the semiclassical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating Markovian open quantum systems in the semiclassical regime poses a grand challenge for computational physics, as the highly oscillatory nature of the dynamics imposes prohibitive resolution requirements on traditional grid-based methods. To overcome this barrier, this paper introduces an efficient Frozen Gaussian Sampling (FGS) algorithm based on the Wigner-Fokker-Planck phase-space formulation. The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations. Leveraging these capabilities, the FGS algorithm serves as a powerful investigatory tool for exploring the long-time behavior of open quantum systems. Specifically, we provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of steady states in strongly non-harmonic potentials-a regime where rigorous analytical results are currently lacking.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Informed Fourier Neural Operator: Universal Approximation and Applications to PDE-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present approximation theories and efficient training methods for derivative-informed Fourier neural operators (DIFNOs) with applications to PDE-constrained optimization. A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fr\'echet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fr\'echet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fr\'echet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fr\'echet derivative learning. Numerical examples on nonlinear diffusion--reaction, Helmholtz, and Navier--Stokes equations demonstrate that DIFNOs are superior in sample complexity for operator learning and solving infinite-dimensional PDE-constrained inverse problems, achieving high accuracy at low training sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Complete Characterizations of Well-Posedness in Parametric Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides complete characterization of well-posedness for Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems associated with general problems of perturbed composite optimization. Leveraging the property of parabolic regularity for composite models, we show that the second-order subderivative of the cost function reduces to the novel second-order variational function playing a crucial role in the subsequent analysis. This foundational result implies that the strong second-order sufficient condition (SSOSC) introduced in this work for the general class of composite optimization problems naturally extends the classical second-order sufficient condition in nonlinear programming. Then we obtain several equivalent characterizations of the second-order qualification condition (SOQC) and highlight its equivalence to the constraint nondegeneracy condition under the $\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility assumption. These insights lead us to multiple equivalent conditions for the major Lipschitz-like/Aubin property of KKT systems, including the SOQC combined with the new second-order subdifferential condition and the SOQC combined with tilt stability of local minimizers. Furthermore, under $\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility, we prove that the Lipschitz-like property of the reference KKT system is equivalent to its strong regularity. Finally, we demonstrate that the Lipschitz-like property is equivalent to the nonsingularity of the generalized Jacobian associated with the KKT system under a certain verifiable assumption. These results provide a unified and rigorous framework for analyzing stability and sensitivity of solutions to composite optimization problems, as well as for the design and justification of numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithm with extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14468v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonconvex optimization problems are widespread in modern machine learning and data science. We introduce an extrapolation strategy into a class of preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithms for nonconvex optimization problems. The proposed algorithms combine second-order backward differentiation formulas (BDF2) with an extrapolation method. Meanwhile, the implicit-explicit scheme simplifies the subproblem through a preconditioned process. As a result, our approach solves nonconvex problems efficiently without significant computational overhead. Theoretical analysis establishes global convergence of the algorithms using Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz properties. Numerical experiments include a benchmark problem, the least squares problem with SCAD regularization, and an image segmentation problem. These results demonstrate that our algorithms are highly efficient, as they achieve reduced solution times and competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Computation and analysis of global solution curves for super-critical equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytical and computational aspects for Dirichlet problem on the unit ball $B$: $|x|&lt;1$ in $R^n$, modeled on the equation \[ \Delta u +\lambda \left(u^p+u^q \right)=0, \;\; \mbox{in $B$}, \;\; u=0 \s \mbox{on $\partial B$}, \] with a positive parameter $\lambda$, and $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{n+2}{n-2}&lt;q$, where $\frac{n+2}{n-2}$ is the critical power. It turns out that a special role is played by the Lin-Ni equation [18], where $q=2p-1$ and $p&gt;\frac{n}{n+2}$. This was already observed by I. Flores [6], who proved the existence of infinitely many ground state solutions. We study properties of infinitely many solution curves of this problem that are separated by these ground state solutions. We also study singular solutions (where $u(0)=\infty$), and again the Lin-Ni equation plays a special role. \medskip
  Super-critical equations are very challenging computationally: solutions exist only for very large $\lambda$, and curves of positive solutions make turns at very large values of $u(0)=||u||_{L^{\infty}}$. We overcome these difficulties by developing new results on singular solutions, and by using some delicate capabilities of {\em Mathematica} software.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Iterative Solvers with Geometry-Aware Neural Preconditioners for Parametric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence behavior of classical iterative solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is often highly sensitive to the domain and specific discretization of PDEs. Previously, we introduced hybrid solvers by combining the classical solvers with neural operators for a specific geometry 1, but they tend to under-perform in geometries not encountered during training. To address this challenge, we introduce Geo-DeepONet, a geometry-aware deep operator network that incorporates domain information extracted from finite element discretizations. Geo-DeepONet enables accurate operator learning across arbitrary unstructured meshes without requiring retraining. Building on this, we develop a class of geometry-aware hybrid preconditioned iterative solvers by coupling Geo-DeepONet with traditional methods such as relaxation schemes and Krylov subspace algorithms. Through numerical experiments on parametric PDEs posed over diverse unstructured domains, we demonstrate the enhanced robustness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid solvers for multiple real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive physics-informed neural network for forward and inverse problems in heterogeneous porous flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a self-adaptive physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that reliably solves forward Darcy flow and performs accurate permeability inversion in heterogeneous porous media. In the forward setting, the PINN predicts velocity and pressure for discontinuous, piecewise-constant permeability; in the inverse setting, it identifies spatially varying permeability directly from indirect flow observations. Both models use a region-aware permeability parameterization with binary spatial masks, which preserves sharp permeability jumps and avoids the smoothing artifacts common in standard PINNs. To stabilize training, we introduce self-learned loss weights that automatically balance PDE residuals, boundary constraints, and data mismatch, eliminating manual tuning and improving robustness, particularly for inverse problems. An interleaved AdamW-L-BFGS optimization strategy further accelerates and stabilizes convergence. Numerical results demonstrate accurate forward surrogates and reliable inverse permeability recovery, establishing the method as an effective mesh-free solver and data-driven inversion tool for porous-media systems governed by partial differential equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08185v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with two-scale integrators for the non-relativistic Klein--Gordon (NRKG) equation with a dimensionless parameter $0&lt;\varepsilon\ll 1$, which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. The highly oscillatory property in time of this model corresponds to the parameter $\varepsilon$ and the equation {in the form of $\partial_{tt}u -\frac{\Delta}{\eps^2} u +\frac{1}{\eps^4}u +\frac{\lambda}{\varepsilon^2} f(u)=0$} {has a factor $1/\varepsilon^2$ in front of the nonlinearity which means that this part becomes strong when $\varepsilon$ is small. These} two aspects bring significantly numerical burdens in designing numerical methods. {We propose a class of two-scale integrators which is constructed based on some reformulations to the system, Fourier pseudo-spectral method and exponential integrators.} Two practical integrators up to order three and four are constructed by using some symmetric conditions and the stiff order conditions of implicit exponential integrators. The convergence of the obtained integrators is rigorously studied, and it is shown that the uniform accuracy in time is $\mathcal{O}(h^3)$ and $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$ for the time stepsize $h$. The near energy conservation over long times is also established for the multi-stage integrators by using modulated Fourier expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds rigorous analysis on the root-exponential convergence for the lightning schemes via rational functions in approximating corner (branch) singularity problems with uniform exponentially clustered poles proposed by Gopal and Trefethen. The start point is to set up the integral representations of $z^\alpha$ and $z^\alpha\log z$ in the slit disk and develop results akin to Paley-Wiener theorem, from which, together with the Poisson summation formula, the root-exponential convergence of the lightning plus polynomial scheme with an exact order for each clustered parameter is established in approximation of prototype functions $z^{\alpha}$ or $z^\alpha\log z$ on a sector-shaped domain, which includes $[0,1]$ as a special case. In addition, the fastest convergence rate is confirmed based upon the best choice of the clustered parameter. Furthermore, the optimal selection of the clustered parameter is employed in conformal mappings through solving Laplace problems on corner domains, building upon Lehman and Wasow's analysis of corner singularities and incorporating the domain decomposition method proposed by Gopal and Trefethen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operator-splitting schemes for approximating Koopman generators of linear semigroups induced by nonlinear flows, a framework originating with Dorroh and Neuberger. Building on ideas of Lie, Kowalewski, and Gr\"{o}bner, we analyze the Koopman semigroup generated by the Lie-Koopman operator and exploit decompositions of this operator into finitely many components to construct Lie-Trotter, Strang, and higher-order compositions with explicit error bounds. A bi-continuous Chernoff extension guarantees well-posedness and contraction of the splitting operators. Numerical experiments on Lotka-Volterra, Van der Pol, and Lorenz systems validate the theory and demonstrate efficiency via work-precision comparisons. The algorithms remain conceptually simple, relying on coordinate freezing combined with one-dimensional solves, which reflects the classical separation-of-variables principle.</description>

Abstract: We investigate anisotropic (piecewise) polynomial approximation of functions in Lebesgue spaces as well as anisotropic Besov spaces. For this purpose we study temporal and spacial moduli of smoothness and their properties. In particular, we prove Jackson- and Whitney-type inequalities on Lipschitz cylinders, i.e., space-time domains $I\times D$ with a finite interval $I$ and a bounded Lipschitz domain $D\subset \R^d$, $d\in \N$. As an application, we prove a direct estimate result for adaptive space-time finite element approximation in the discontinuous setting.</description>

Abstract: The extended-domain method is a strategy for applying spectral methods to complex geometries. Its stability is complicated by the ill-conditioning of the Fourier extension frame. This paper provides a rigorous analysis of the method's pre-asymptotic behavior. We confirm that the spectral collocation system is asymptotically ill-conditioned for both the Poisson and convection-diffusion operators, driven by the redundancy of the underlying frame. However, we prove a fundamental structural dichotomy in their discrete Green's functions. We show that the inverse of the convection-diffusion operator is numerically quasi-sparse, exhibiting exponential off-diagonal decay, in stark contrast to the numerically dense inverse of the Poisson operator. This intrinsic sparsity explains why the convection-diffusion operator is significantly more robust to the underlying frame instability in practical computations.</description>

      <title>Kemeny's constant minimization for reversible Markov chains via structure-preserving perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24679</link>

Abstract: Kemeny's constant measures the efficiency of a Markov chain in traversing its states. We investigate whether structure-preserving perturbations to the transition probabilities of a reversible Markov chain can improve its connectivity while maintaining a fixed stationary distribution. Although the minimum achievable value for Kemeny's constant can be estimated, the required perturbations may be infeasible. We reformulate the problem as an optimization task, focusing on solution existence and efficient algorithms, with an emphasis to the problem of minimizing Kemeny's constant under sparsity constraints.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau equation via vortex tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical simulation of the 2D magnetic time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations in the regime of small but finite (inverse) Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\epsilon$ and constant (order $1$ in $\epsilon$) applied magnetic field. In this regime, a well-known feature of the TDGL equation is the appearance of quantized vortices with core size of order $\epsilon$. Moreover, in the singular limit $\epsilon \searrow 0$, these vortices evolve according to an explicit ODE system. In this work, we first introduce a new numerical method for the numerical integration of this limiting ODE system, which requires to solve a linear second order PDE at each time step. We also provide a rigorous theoretical justification for this method that applies to a general class of 2D domains. We then develop and analyze a numerical strategy based on the finite-dimensional ODE system to efficiently simulate the infinite-dimensional TDGL equations in the presence of a constant external magnetic field and for small, but finite, $\epsilon$. This method allows us to avoid resolving the $\epsilon$-scale when solving the TDGL equations, where small values of $\epsilon$ typically require very fine meshes and time steps. We provide numerical examples on a few test cases and justify the accuracy of the method with numerical investigations. We end the paper showing that, in the mixed flow case, the limiting ODE system is able to capture the crystallization process in which, for large times, the vortices arrange into a stable pattern.</description>

      <title>Two-step Generalized RBF-Generated Finite Difference Method on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds defined by randomly sampled point clouds is a challenging problem in scientific computing and has broad applications in various fields. In this paper, we develop a two-step generalized radial basis function-generated finite difference (gRBF-FD) method for solving PDEs on manifolds without boundaries, identified by randomly sampled point cloud data. The gRBF-FD is based on polyharmonic spline kernels and multivariate polynomials (PHS+Poly) defined over the tangent space in a local Monge coordinate system. The first step is to regress the local target function using a generalized moving least squares (GMLS) while the second step is to compensate for the residual using a PHS interpolation. Our gRBF-FD method has the same interpolant form with the standard RBF-FD but differs in interpolation coefficients. Our approach utilizes a specific weight function in both the GMLS and PHS steps and implements an automatic tuning strategy for the stencil size K (i.e., the number of nearest neighbors) at each point. These strategies are designed to produce a Laplacian matrix with a specific coefficient structure, thereby enhancing stability and reducing the solution error. We establish an error bound for the operator approximation in terms of the so-called local stencil diameter as well as in terms of the number of data. We further demonstrate the high accuracy of gRBF-FD through numerical tests on various smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>Efficient Boys function evaluation using minimax approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for efficient evaluation of Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{k_\mathrm{max}}$ tailored to modern computing architectures, in particular graphical processing units (GPUs), where maximum throughput is high and data movement is costly. The method combines rational minimax approximations with upward and downward recurrence relations. The non-negative real axis is partitioned into three regions, $[0,\infty\rangle = A\cup B\cup C$, where regions $A$ and $B$ are treated using rational minimax approximations and region $C$ by an asymptotic approximation. This formulation avoids lookup tables and irregular memory access, making it well suited hardware with high maximum throughput and low latency. The rational minimax coefficients are generated using the rational Remez algorithm. For a target maximum absolute error of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{tol} = 5\cdot10^{-14}$, the corresponding approximation regions and coefficients for Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{32}$ are provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Sub-diffusion Model using Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the convergence behavior of two waveform relaxation algorithms, namely the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation algorithms, for an optimal control problem with a sub-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) constraint. The algorithms are tested on regular 1D domains with multiple subdomains, and the analysis focuses on how different constant values of the generalized diffusion coefficient affect the convergence of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pointwise Statistics in Hyperbolic Equations with Random Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional hyperbolic PDEs, linear and nonlinear, with random initial data. Our focus is the {\em pointwise statistics,} i.e., the probability measure of the solution at any fixed point in space and time. For linear hyperbolic equations, the probability density function (PDF) of these statistics satisfies the same linear PDE. For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we derive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF. Both results are valid only as long as no shocks have formed, a limitation which is inherent to the problem, as demonstrated by a counterexample. For systems of linear hyperbolic equations, we introduce the multi-point statistics and derive their evolution equations. In all of the settings we consider, the resulting PDEs for the statistics are of practical significance: they enable efficient evaluation of the random dynamics, without requiring an ensemble of solutions of the underlying PDE, and their cost is not affected by the dimension of the random parameter space. Additionally, the evolution equations for the statistics lead to a priori statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods (in particular, Kernel Density Estimators) when applied to hyperbolic PDEs with random data.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent avoids strict saddles with a simple line-search method too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that gradient descent (GD) on a $C^2$ cost function generically avoids strict saddle points when using a small, constant step size. However, no such guarantee existed for GD with a line-search method. We provide one for a modified version of the standard Armijo backtracking method with generic, arbitrarily large initial step size. The proof underlines the double role of the Luzin $N^{-1}$ property for the iteration maps, and allows to forgo the habitual Lipschitz gradient assumption.
  We extend this to the Riemannian setting (RGD), assuming the retraction is real analytic (though the cost function still only needs to be $C^2$). In closing, we also improve guarantees for RGD with a constant step size in some scenarios.</description>

      <title>KD-PINN: Knowledge-Distilled PINNs for ultra-low-latency real-time neural PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Knowledge-Distilled Physics-Informed Neural Networks (KD-PINN), a framework that transfers the predictive accuracy of a high-capacity teacher model to a compact student through a continuous adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In order to confirm its generality for various dynamics and dimensionalities, the framework is evaluated on a representative set of partial differential equations (PDEs). Across the considered benchmarks, the student model achieves inference speedups ranging from x4.8 (Navier-Stokes) to x6.9 (Burgers), while preserving accuracy. Accuracy is improved by on the order of 1% when the model is properly tuned. The distillation process also revealed a regularizing effect. With an average inference latency of 5.3 ms on CPU, the distilled models enter the ultra-low-latency real-time regime defined by sub-10 ms performance. Finally, this study examines how knowledge distillation reduces inference latency in PINNs, to contribute to the development of accurate ultra-low-latency neural PDE solvers.</description>
