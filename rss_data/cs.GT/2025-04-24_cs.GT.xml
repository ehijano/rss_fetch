      <title>Peer-Aware Cost Estimation in Nonlinear General-Sum Dynamic Games for Mutual Learning and Intent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-robot interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum dynamic games since the objective functions of both agents are not explicitly known to each other. However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ) approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety assurance. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables \textbf{intent communication} in such multi-agent systems by explicitly modeling the peer's learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Edge-weighted Online Stochastic Matching Under Jaillet-Lu LP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The online stochastic matching problem was introduced by [FMMM09], together with the $(1-\frac1e)$-competitive Suggested Matching algorithm. In the most general edge-weighted setting, this ratio has not been improved for more than one decade, until recently [Yan24] beat the $1-\frac1e$ bound and [QFZW23] further improved the ratio to $0.650$. Both of these works measure the online competitiveness against the offline LP relaxation introduced by [JL14]. This LP has also played an important role in other settings since it is a natural choice for two-choices online algorithms.
  In this paper, we propose an upper bound of $0.663$ and a lower bound of $0.662$ for edge-weighted online stochastic matching under Jaillet-Lu LP. First, we propose a hard instance and prove that the optimal online algorithm for this instance only has a competitive ratio $&lt;0.663$. Then, we show that a near-optimal algorithm for this instance can be generalized to work on all instances and achieve a competitive ratio $&gt;0.662$. It indicates that more powerful LPs are necessary if we want to further improve the ratio by $0.001$.</description>

      <title>The Incentive Guarantees Behind Nash Welfare in Divisible Resources Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating divisible resources among $n$ agents, hopefully in a fair and efficient manner. With the presence of strategic agents, additional incentive guarantees are also necessary, and the problem of designing fair and efficient mechanisms becomes much less tractable. While there are flourishing positive results against strategic agents for homogeneous divisible items, very few of them are known to hold in cake cutting.
  We show that the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) mechanism, which provides desirable fairness and efficiency guarantees and achieves an incentive ratio of $2$ for homogeneous divisible items, also has an incentive ratio of $2$ in cake cutting. Remarkably, this result holds even without the free disposal assumption, which is hard to get rid of in the design of truthful cake cutting mechanisms.
  Moreover, we show that, for cake cutting, the Partial Allocation (PA) mechanism proposed by Cole et al. (EC'13), which is truthful and $1/e$-MNW for homogeneous divisible items, has an incentive ratio between $[e^{1 / e}, e]$ and when randomization is allowed, can be turned to be truthful in expectation. Given two alternatives for a trade-off between incentive ratio and Nash welfare provided by the MNW and PA mechanisms, we establish an interpolation between them for both cake cutting and homogeneous divisible items.
  Finally, we study the optimal incentive ratio achievable by envy-free cake cutting mechanisms. We first give an envy-free mechanism for two agents with an incentive ratio of $4 / 3$. Then, we show that any envy-free cake cutting mechanism with the connected pieces constraint has an incentive ratio of $\Theta(n)$.</description>

      <title>The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains revenue-maximizing.</description>

      <title>Linear Functions to the Extended Reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.09552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates functions from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}$ that satisfy axioms of linearity wherever allowed by extended-value arithmetic. They have a nontrivial structure defined inductively on $d$, and unlike finite linear functions, they require $\Omega(d^2)$ parameters to uniquely identify. In particular they can capture vertical tangent planes to epigraphs: a function (never $-\infty$) is convex if and only if it has an extended-valued subgradient at every point in its effective domain, if and only if it is the supremum of a family of "affine extended" functions. These results are applied to the well-known characterization of proper scoring rules, for the finite-dimensional case: it is carefully and rigorously extended here to a more constructive form. In particular it is investigated when proper scoring rules can be constructed from a given convex function.</description>
