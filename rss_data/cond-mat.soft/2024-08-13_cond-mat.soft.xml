      <title>Dynamics of polymers in coarse-grained nematic solvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers are a primary building block in many biomaterials, often interacting with anisotropic backgrounds. While previous studies have considered polymer dynamics within nematic solvents, rarely are the the effects of anisotropic viscosity and polymer elongation differentiated. Here, we study polymers embedded in nematic liquid crystals with isotropic viscosity via numerical simulations, to explicitly investigate the effect of nematicity on macromolecular conformation and how conformation alone can produce anisotropic dynamics. We employ a hybrid technique that captures nematic orientation, thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions. The coupling of the polymer backbone to the nematic field elongates the polymer, producing anisotropic diffusion even in nematic solvents with isotropic viscosity. For intermediate coupling, the competition between background anisotropy and macrmolecular entropy leads to hairpins - sudden kinks along the backbone of the polymer. Experiments of DNA embedded in a solution of rod-like fd viruses qualitatively support the role of hairpins in establishing characteristic conformational features that govern polymer dynamics. Hairpin diffusion along the backbone exponentially slows as coupling increases. Better understanding two-way coupling between polymers and their surroundings could allow the creation of more biomimetic composite materials.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent flow generation in active cytoskeletal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The actomyosin cytoskeleton, a protein assembly comprising actin fibers and the myosin molecular motor, drives various cellular dynamics through contractile force generation at high densities. However, the relationship between the density dependence of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and force-controlled ordered structure remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured contraction-driven flow generation by varying the concentration of cell extracts containing the actomyosin cytoskeleton and associated nucleation factors. We observed continuous actin flow toward the center at a critical actomyosin density in cell-sized droplets. Notably, the actin flow demonstrated emergent oscillations, in which tracer advection periodically changed in a stop-and-go fashion in bulk solution. Near the onset of flow, the viscous drag of the actin cytoskeleton decreased the particle transport, after which it rapidly increased. These results indicate that the density-dependent actin flow is generated by a balance between viscous friction and contractile force.</description>

      <title>In pursuit of the tetratic phase in hard rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate two-dimensional systems of hard rectangles at constant pressure through extensive hard-particle Monte Carlo simulations. We determine the complete phase diagram as a function of packing fraction and aspect ratio, which consists of four distinct phases. At very high packing fractions, particles form a smectic solid for all aspect ratios. Rod-like particles with large aspect ratio assemble in an intervening nematic phase, which is displaced by a "tetratic" phase (also called biaxial nematic) for moderately elongated rectangles. Surprisingly, we find evidence that the transition from tetratic to smectic is weakly discontinuous at variance with previously proposed two-step scenarios for the melting of hard particles.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Intermittency in Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results suggest that highly active, chaotic, non-equilibrium states of living fluids might share much in common with high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of intermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge the worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing possibilities of what makes flows intermittent.</description>

      <title>Yielding in colloidal gels: from local structure to meso-scale strand breakage and macroscopic failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study creep flow and yielding of particulate depletion gels under constant shear stress, combining data on different length and time scales. We characterise the breakage of meso-scale strands in the gel. Breakage events are distributed homogeneously in space, corresponding to macroscopically ductile flow. At the microscale, a spatio-temporal analysis of structural and mechanical metrics connects properties of strands before and after they fail, indicating that strand breakage is statistically predictable. Using results from different scales, we discuss the interplay between creeping and aging dynamics, and we demonstrate a viscosity bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Simple fluctuations in simple glass formers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical single-particle fluctuations associated with particle displacements are inherent to simple glass-forming liquids in the limit of large dimensions and leave a pseudo-critical trace across all finite dimensions. This characteristic could serve as a crucial test for distinguishing between theories of glass formation. We here examine these critical fluctuations, as captured by the well-established non-Gaussian parameter, within both mode-coupling theory (MCT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) across dimensions for hard sphere liquids and for the minimally structured Mari--Kurchan model. We establish general scaling laws relevant to any liquid dynamics theory in large dimensions and show that the dimensional scalings predicted by MCT are inconsistent with those from DMFT. Simulation results for hard spheres in moderately high dimensions align with the DMFT scenario, reinforcing the relevance of mean-field theory for capturing glass physics in finite dimensions. We identify potential adjustments to MCT to account for certain mean-field physics. Our findings also highlight that local structure and spatial dimensionality can affect single-particle critical fluctuations in non-trivial ways.</description>

      <title>The explicit bonding Reaction ensemble Monte Carlo method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the explicit bonding Reaction ensemble Monte Carlo (eb-RxMC) method, designed to sample reversible bonding reactions in macromolecular systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. Our eb-RxMC method is based on the Reaction ensemble method, however, its implementation differs from the latter by the representation of the reaction. In the eb-RxMC implementation, we are adding or deleting bonds between existing particles, instead of inserting or deleting particles with different chemical identities. This new implementation makes the eb-RxMC method suitable for simulating the formation of reversible linkages between macromolecules, which would not be feasible with the original implementation. To enable coupling of our eb-RxMC algorithm with Molecular Dynamics algorithm for sampling of the configuration space, we biased the sampling of reactions only within a certain inclusion radius. We validated our algorithm using a set of ideally behaving systems undergoing dimerization and polycondensation reactions, for which analytical results are available. For dimerization reactions with various equilibrium constants and initial compositions, the degree of conversion measured in our simulations perfectly matched the reference values given by the analytical equations. We also showed that this agreement is not affected by the arbitrary choice of the inclusion radius or the stiffness of the harmonic bond potential. Next, we showed that our simulations can correctly match the analytical results for the distribution of the degree of polymerization and end-to-end distance of ideal chains in polycondensation reactions. Altogether, we demonstrated that our eb-RxMC simulations correctly sample both reaction and configuration space of these reference systems, opening the door to future simulations of more complex interacting macromolecular systems.</description>

      <title>Fluidification of Entangled Polymers by Loop Extrusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop extrusion is one of the main processes shaping chromosome organisation across the cell cycle, yet its role in regulating DNA entanglement and nucleoplasm viscoelasticity remains overlooked. We simulate entangled solutions of linear polymers under the action of generic Loop Extruding Factors (LEF) with a model that fully accounts for topological constraints and LEF-DNA uncrossability. We discover that extrusion drives the formation of bottle-brush-like structures which significantly lower the entanglement and effective viscosity of the system through an active fluidification mechanism. Interestingly, this fluidification displays an optimum at one LEF every 300-3000 basepairs. In marked contrast with entangled linear chains, the viscosity of extruded chains scales linearly with polymer length, yielding up to 1000-fold fluidification. Our results illuminate how loop extrusion contributes to actively modulate genome entanglement and viscoelasticity in vivo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unique bistable transition has been identified in granular/colloidal gel-composites, resulting from shear-induced phase separation of the gel phase into dense blobs. In energy applications, it is critical to understand how this transition influences electrical performance. Mixing conductive colloids with conductive inclusions, we find the conductivity and elasticity move in concert, both decreasing in the collapsed phase-separated state. Surprisingly, with insulating inclusions these properties can become decoupled, with the conductivity instead increasing despite the collapse of the gel structure.</description>

      <title>Rotational dynamics of a disk in a thin film of weakly nematic fluid subject to linear friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics at low Reynolds numbers experiences recent revival in the fields of biophysics and active matter. While in bulk isotropic fluids it is exhaustively studied, this is less so in anisotropic fluids and in confined situations. Here, we combine the latter two by studying the rotation of a disk-like inclusion in a uniaxially anisotropic, globally oriented, incompressible two-dimensional fluid film. In terms of a perturbative expansion in parameters that quantify anisotropies in viscosity and in additional linear friction with a supporting substrate or other type of confinement, we derive analytical expressions for the resulting hydrodynamic flow and pressure fields as well as for the resistance and mobility coefficients of the rotating disk. It turns out that, in contrast to translational motion, the solutions remain well-behaved also in the absence of the additional linear friction. Comparison with results from finite-element simulations show very good agreement with those from our analytical calculations. Besides applications to describe technological systems, for instance, in the area of microfluidics and thin cells of aligned nematic liquid crystals, our solutions are important for quantitative theoretical approaches to fluid membranes and thin films in general featuring a preferred direction.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling solution for a rigidity transition: renormalization group flows near the upper critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rigidity transitions induced by the formation of system-spanning disordered rigid clusters, like the jamming transition, can be well-described in most physically relevant dimensions by mean-field theories. A dynamical mean-field theory commonly used to study these transitions, the coherent potential approximation (CPA), shows logarithmic corrections in $2$ dimensions. By solving the theory in arbitrary dimensions and extracting the universal scaling predictions, we show that these logarithmic corrections are a symptom of an upper critical dimension $d_{u}=2$, below which the critical exponents are modified. We recapitulate Ken Wilson's phenomenology of the $(4-\epsilon)$-dimensional Ising model, but with the upper critical dimension reduced to $2$. We interpret this using normal form theory as a transcritical bifurcation in the RG flows and extract the universal nonlinear coefficients to make explicit predictions for the behavior near $2$ dimensions. This bifurcation is driven by a variable that is dangerously irrelevant in all dimensions $d&gt;2$ which incorporates the physics of long-wavelength phonons and low-frequency elastic dissipation. We derive universal scaling functions from the CPA sufficient to predict all linear response in randomly diluted isotropic elastic systems in all dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between bacterial flagella and surrounding boundaries are important for bacterial motility and gait in complex environment. By modeling each flagellar filament that is both thin and long as a string of spheres, we show that such hydrodynamic interactions can be accurately described through a resistance tensor, which can be efficiently evaluated numerically. For the case of close interaction between one bacterium and one passive colloidal sphere, we see notable difference between results from our model and those from the resistive force theory, showing that the error arises from negligence of the width of flagellar filaments in resistive force theory can be strong.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random non-reciprocal interactions between a large number of conserved densities are shown to enhance the stability of the system towards pattern formation. The enhanced stability is an exact result when the number of species approaches infinity and is confirmed numerically by simulations of the multi-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model. Furthermore, the diversity in dynamical patterns increases with increasing number of components and novel steady states such as pulsating or spatiotemporally chaotic condensates are observed. Our results may help to unravel the mechanisms by which living systems self-organise via metabolism.</description>
