      <title>Exclusive photon-fusion production of even-spin resonances and exotic QED atoms in high-energy hadron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cross sections for the single exclusive production of (pseudo)scalar and (pseudo)tensor hadrons, as well as of even-spin QED bound states formed by pairs of opposite-charge leptons or hadrons, are estimated for photon-fusion processes in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus at the RHIC, LHC and FCC colliders, as well as in proton-air interactions at the highest energies reached by cosmic-rays impinging on earth. The UPC cross sections are computed in the equivalent photon approximation with realistic photon fluxes from the charged form factors of proton, lead, gold, and nitrogen ions. The production of four types of even-spin systems are considered: quarkonium (spin-0,2,4 meson bound states, from the lightest $\pi^0$ meson up to toponium), exotic hadrons (including candidate multiquark states), leptonium (positronium, dimuonium, and ditauonium), as well as mesonium (pionium, kaonium, D-onia, and B-onia) and baryonium (notably, protonium) QED atoms. The expected yields at the different colliders are presented for about 50 such even-spin composite resonances, for which the ALICE and LHCb experiments have potential reconstruction capabilities at the LHC. The impact of the diphoton decays of such even-spin states is also discussed as resonant backgrounds in the measurement of light-by-light scattering ($\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$) over $m_{\gamma\gamma} = 0.1$--15 GeV in PbPb UPCs at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors in the perturbative limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) have been paid attention in recent years because of their relation with the energy momentum tensor (EMT) form factors (FFs). The GDAs can be experimentally accessed through the study of amplitudes in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair such as $\pi \eta $ and $\eta \eta^{\prime}$. In this paper we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit where the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are expressed in terms of meson distribution amplitudes which have been constrained in the past experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF which breaks the conservation law of EMT for each quark flavor in its hadronic matrix element. In addition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical between $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, which confirms the universality of GDAs. In future, the GDAs and EMT FFs studied in this paper can be investigated at Belle II. Our study enhances the accessibility to the $P$-wave GDAs in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$ and gives a promising way to search for exotic hybrid mesons in the future experiment.</description>

      <title>Identified hadron production at hadron colliders in NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to identified hadron production at hadron colliders. The inclusion of the NNLO correction has an important impact on all observables considered in this work. Higher order corrections reduce scale uncertainty and in almost all cases are moderate. Overall, good perturbative convergence is observed across kinematics and observables. The uncertainty due to missing higher orders is relatively small and, in many cases, smaller than the experimental uncertainty. The largest source of theoretical uncertainty at present is from the knowledge of the non-perturbative parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FF), which dwarfs the scale uncertainty in most kinematic ranges. The inclusion of NNLO corrections demonstrates the precision studies potential of this class of observables. To fully realize this potential, however, a new generation of improved fragmentation functions may be needed. The results of the present work will enable global fits of FF with NNLO precision.</description>

      <title>Anomalous nuclear effects on ion charge state distribution in helium gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The influence of isotope differences on ion charge state yield ratios has never been studied in detail, having been considered negligible. However, we have observed anomalous ion charge state distributions in the thermalization of energetic atomic ions in helium gas; the charge state distributions varied between not only isotopes but also between nuclear states within the same nuclide. The magnitude of the observed results suggests that this anomaly is a universal phenomenon that cannot be explained by the framework of the known isotope effects. Nuclear spin and deformation could be key to unraveling this, but the mechanisms remain an open question.</description>

      <title>Application of Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Improved Optics Measurements from s star Movement at sPHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current average horizontal beta beat measurements between operating Interaction Regions (IR) in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are around 15 percent along with significant variation in s star. This threshold to measure the linear optics can be improved by considering preprocessing methods involving data reconstruction such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and cross checking between different method variations, model independent and dependent methods, and turn by turn (TBT) datasets. These were then applied to analyze the movement of horizontal s star at the 8 o clock IR at RHIC (IR8). This movement was done using an optics response matrix to determine magnet strengths necessary to move horizontal s star without disturbing other optics. Data preprocessing was found to significantly aid in beat reduction around IP, with DMD demonstrating the least variability between preprocessing methods and between horizontal s star movements. These preprocessing methods will be implemented into RHIC for future linear optics analysis.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic emission from strongly interacting hadronic and partonic matter created in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dilepton production in heavy-ion, proton-proton, and proton-nucleus collisions from low energies of 1 AGeV (SIS) to ultra-relativistic energies (LHC) using the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. PHSD is a microscopic, non-equilibrium approach that integrates hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions from initial nucleon-nucleon interactions to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, hadronization, and final-state interactions. Key dilepton sources in PHSD include hadronic decays, bremsstrahlung, QGP radiation ($q+\bar q \to e^+e^-$, \ $q+\bar q \to g+ e^+e^-$, \ $q+g \to q+ e^+e^-$), primary Drell-Yan production, and semileptonic decays of correlated charm and bottom pairs. PHSD well describes dilepton data from HADES, STAR, and ALICE experiments. We examine in-medium effects, such as the vector meson spectral function broadening, and present the excitation function for the dilepton "excess" in the invariant mass range $0.4&lt;M_{ee}&lt;0.75$ GeV/c$^2$. For the first time we report on the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP radiation calculated on a basis of the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) in PHSD. The influence of $\mu_B$ on the QGP yield grows at lower collision energies, where $\mu_B$ becomes large, however, its impact on the total dilepton spectra is small due to the lowering of the QGP volume with decreasing energy. The excitation function of QGP dileptons, is presented versus correlated charm, confirming that the QGP radiation overshines charm contributions at $\sqrt{s} \simeq 25-30$ GeV in central Au+Au collisions, providing access to thermal QGP dileptons at BES RHIC and FAIR.</description>
