      <title>Information processing driven by multicomponent surface condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living organisms rely on molecular networks, such as gene circuits and signaling pathways, for information processing and robust decision-making in crowded, noisy environments. Recent advances show that interacting biomolecules self-organize by phase transitions into coexisting spatial compartments called condensates, often on cellular surfaces such as chromatin and membranes. In this paper, we demonstrate that multicomponent fluids can be designed to recruit distinct condensates to surfaces with differing compositions, performing a form of surface classification by condensation. We draw an analogy to multidimensional classification in machine learning and explore how hidden species, analogous to hidden nodes, expand the expressivity and capacity of these interacting ensembles to facilitate complex decision boundaries. By simply changing levels of individual species, we find that the same molecular repertoire can be reprogrammed to solve new tasks. Together, our findings suggest that the physical processes underlying biomolecular condensates can encode and drive adaptive information processing beyond compartmentalization.</description>

      <title>IR Spectroscopic Studies of Gas-Phase Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins are vital biological molecules found in every living organism, and their function is determined by what shape they fold into. Peptides are essentially subsets of proteins, and therefore ideal as model systems for protein folding. The structure of a molecule is closely related to its vibrational absorption spectrum, which lies in the infrared (IR) range. However, in vivo IR spectroscopy is hindered by interference from the surrounding water. Therefore, peptides are preferably studied isolated from solution, in the gas phase. This chapter summarizes the recent IR spectroscopy studies of gas-phase peptides. The collected works show that IR spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations is a powerful tool for deducing the molecular structure. Moreover the wealth of experimental spectra makes possible the evaluation of different quantum chemical models, which can be applied to the larger proteins.</description>

      <title>Stability of bond clusters with a characteristic length scale for load distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biological materials, strong binding despite an applied load force is often based on clusters of dynamic bonds that share the load. Different macroscopic behaviors have been described depending on whether the load is shared locally or globally in the force-depended unbinding rate. Here we introduce and study a model in which the load is distributed over a characteristic length scale, introduced by an exponential decay. The model contains the local and global scenario as limiting cases and smoothly interpolates between them. We derive approximations in which some analytical results can be obtained. In particular, we derive rupture conditions and validate these with stochastic simulations. The model shows two main pathways for failure of the bond cluster, due to rupture of all bonds above a critical force and due to the formation of a critical crack, a large gap between closed bonds that spreads in both directions.</description>

      <title>Single-frame super-resolution via Sparse Point Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is essential in biological and medical research, providing critical insights into cellular structures. However, limited by optical diffraction and background noise, a substantial amount of hidden information is still unexploited. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel computational method, termed Sparse Point Optimization Theory (SPOT), which accurately localizes fluorescent emitters by solving an optimization problem. Our results demonstrate that SPOT successfully resolves 30 nm fluorescent line pairs, reveals structural details beyond the diffraction limit in both Airyscan and structured illumination microscopy, and outperforms established algorithms in single-molecule localization tasks. This generic method effectively pushes the resolution limit in the presence of noise, and holds great promise for advancing fluorescence microscopy and analysis in cell biology.</description>

      <title>Molecular-Size Control of Properties of Therapeutic Nano-Paper Allows for Selective Drug Storage in Small Doses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel concept of nano-scaled interwoven templates for drug delivery with alternating hydro- and lipophilicity properties is introduced. They are built from cellulose and peptide hydrogel in tandem, and characterized by a nano-stacked interwoven design, thus enabling for tuning the lipophilicity in the mesh nano-domains in which drug candidates of complementary lipophilicities can be embedded. This allows for low-dose-controlled consumption and therapeutic applications. Time-resolved and in-situ grazing incidence X-ray scattering studies confirm the design of the therapeutic nano-paper and create conditions suitable for the drug storage of complementary properties. The molecular design has the potential of a locally controlled, site-specific drug release on a beyond-nanomolar scale. Generalized, the design may contribute to facile developments of personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Controlling the collective transport of large passive particles with suspensions of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising approach to transport cargo at the microscale lies within the use of self-propelled microorganisms, whose motion entrains that of passive particles. However, most applications remain limited to just a few passive particles of similar size as the microorganisms, since the transport mechanism relies on the interaction between individual swimmers and single particles. Here, we demonstrate how to control the collective transport of hundreds of large passive particles with phototactic microalga. Using directional light stimuli in suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we trigger bioconvection rolls capable of macroscale transport. Passive particles an order of magnitude larger than the microalgae are either attracted or repelled by the rolls depending on their density. Using experiments and simulation, we rationalize these bioconvective flows and describe how to harness them for cargo transport, with future applications in targeted drug delivery and decontamination.</description>

      <title>Membrane Heterogeneity Driven Dynamics of Multicomponent Vesicles in Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their significance in biology and materials science, the dynamics of multicomponent vesicles under shear flow remain poorly understood because of their nonlinear and strongly coupled nature, especially regarding the role of membrane heterogeneity in driving nonequilibrium behavior. Here we present a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model, which is validated against experiments, for the quantitative investigation of these dynamics. While prior research has primarily focused on viscosity or bending rigidity contrasts, we demonstrate that surface tension heterogeneity can also trigger swinging and tumbling in vesicles under shear. Additionally, our systematic phase diagram reveals three previously unreported dynamical regimes arising from the interplay between bending rigidity heterogeneity and shear flow. Overall, our model provides a robust framework for understanding multicomponent vesicle dynamics, with findings offering new physical insights and design principles for tunable vesicle-based carriers.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium lifetimes of DNA under electronic current in a molecular junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation often occurs in confined systems, yet how boundaries shape patterning dynamics is unclear. We develop techniques to analyze confinement effects in nonlocal advection-diffusion equations, which generically capture the collective dynamics of active self-attracting particles. We identify a sequence of size-controlled transitions that generate characteristic slow modes, leading to exponential increase of patterning timescales. Experimental measurements of multicellular dynamics confirm our predictions.</description>

      <title>Actin driven morphogenesis in hydra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydra, a centimeter long cylindrical-shaped freshwater organism, has emerged as an interesting model system for studying morphogenesis in animals. Recently, fluorescent imaging of cytoskeletal actin filaments on the outer surface of hydra has revealed nematic-type arrangement of actin filaments. {Several topological defects in the nematic field have also been detected. In particular, aster-like +1 defects appear at the curved head of hydra and at the tip of its tentacles, while -1/2 defects are seen at the base of the tentacles. However, functional role of these defects in tissue development is not clear. Motivated by these observations, we here model hydra's epthelial tissue as a visco-elastic membrane and the tentacles as growing membrane tubes driven by a nematic interaction among actin. We consider the epithelial layer of hydra as a fluid membrane and carry out a non-equilibrium simulation which also includes membrane growth and polymerization of actin. We show that specific kind of defect at the head does not play any positive role in emergence of the tentacles. The reorganization of actin at the base and the tip of growing tentacles are consistent with other possible defect structures at the head as well. While it is known that regions of tentacle growth are hot spots of chemical signaling, involving Wnt3/$\beta$-catenin pathway, we propose that active polymerization of actin bundles could also be an important player in the growth of tubular tentacles. In addition to polymerization, fluidity of our model membrane, capturing effective fluidity of the epithelial tissue, turns out to be essential for enabling such growth.</description>

      <title>Injection and Imaging of Achiral Microswimmers in Zebrafish</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving stable in vivo locomotion is essential for using magnetically actuated microswimmers for biomedical applications; however, while existing microswimmers have excellent motion control in vitro, their motion is greatly hindered inside living organisms. Moreover, previous work had only visually demonstrated in vivo motion through gradient pulling or rolling, but not swimming. This study investigated the injection and imaging of the achiral planar microswimmers (APMs) inside a live zebrafish embryo. The APMs can be actuated under a rotating magnetic field to generate a forward thrust at low Reynolds number environment. Combined with a safe injection technique and clear in vivo imaging at high resolution, it would be possible to control the swimming motion of APMs inside the zebrafish embryo. This work shows the safe injection and the clear imaging of an APM in a transparent zebrafish model, demonstrating the possibility for follow-up in-depth studies of the swimming motion of microswimmers in vivo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by motile cells in tissue formation, we find that active systems of self-aligning adhesive particles undergo ballistic aggregation through a flocking transition. This kinetic regime emerges when the cluster persistence length grows faster with cluster mass than the intercluster distance does. We also identify and explain distinct non-collective kinetic regimes, including biologically relevant long-lived transients. Our analytical and numerical results offer a unified framework explaining the broad range of experimentally observed aggregation exponents in cellular systems and reveal physical principles potentially critical for timely tissue organization.</description>
