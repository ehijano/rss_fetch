      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effective Lagrangian for the Axion-Like Particle (ALP) arising in a class of composite Higgs models. We discuss the peculiarities of the coupling to the quark sector specific of these models, including flavor violating terms. We then confront the main bounds from rare B-meson decays.</description>

      <title>Towards the determination of CP-odd pion-nucleon couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleon matrix elements (NMEs) associated with quark chromo-magnetic dipole moments (cMDMs) play a crucial role in determining the CP-odd pion-nucleon couplings induced by quark chromo-electric dipole moments. In recent years, it has been argued that the NMEs of cMDMs can be related to the third moment of the nucleon's higher-twist (specifically, twist-three) parton distribution function (PDF) $e(x)$, which can, in principle, be measured through dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes. By applying the spin-flavor expansion to the cMDM operators in the large-$N_c$ limit, where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors, we show that the NMEs receive contributions not only from the twist-three PDF $e(x)$ but also from an additional, previously neglected nucleon form factor. Incorporating constraints from the spin-flavor expansion, recent experimental data on $e(x)$, as well as model calculations of $e(x)$, we estimate the NMEs of the cMDM operators. Our analysis indicates that the NMEs are dominated by the nucleon form factors, and the cMDM contributions to pion-nucleon couplings can be comparable to those from the quark sigma terms.</description>

      <title>Pion Gravitational Form Factors in Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the momentum-transfer dependence of the pion gravitational form factors (GFFs) within a top-down holographic QCD framework. These form factors encode essential information about the internal stress distribution of hadrons and may serve as a tool to explore the non-perturbatice dyanmics responsible for quark and gluon confinement in QCD. In particular, we evaluate the forward-limit value of the GFFs, known as the D-term, within the framework of the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Our analysis also reveals glueball dominance, wherein the pion's gravitational interaction is mediated by an infinite tower of glueball excitations.</description>

      <title>The impact of glasma on heavy quark spectra and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the glasma classical color fields, produced in the very early stage of heavy-ion collisions, on the transport of heavy quarks. The glasma fields evolve according to the classical Yang-Mills equations, while the dynamics of heavy quarks is described by Wong's equations. We numerically solve these equations and compute the transport coefficient $\kappa$, which is anisotropic and initially very large. Further, we extract observables sensitive to the initial glasma stage. The heavy quark nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is affected by the glasma but the effect is moderate compared to the nPDF contribution. Our main finding is that the glasma has a large impact on the azimuthal correlation between $Q\overline{Q}$ pairs, initially produced back-to-back.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fermion Propagators and Flavor-Changing via Loop Corrections in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Minimally Extended Standard Model in the mass basis in the symmetric phase of the early Universe, demonstrating that the CP-violating CKM and PMNS matrices emerge not only in the weak interactions but also in the Yukawa interactions. This is due to the presence of all four components of the Higgs field and leads to a violation of fermion flavor conservation, a phenomenon absent in the broken phase. Specifically, left-handed fermions acquire additional thermal mass contributions involving the absolute values of CKM and PMNS matrix elements. Most notably, the structure of Yukawa interactions enables flavor-changing and CP-violating transitions among left-handed fermions, such as $u_L\leftrightarrow c_L$, which do not occur in the broken phase. In contrast, the right-handed fermions retain their mass eigenstates, leading to distinct thermal masses. Additionally, we identify novel CP-violating scattering processes, such as $u_L\bar{c}_L\rightarrow 2A_3$, which are exclusive to the symmetric phase.</description>

      <title>Understanding photon TMDs using light-front wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we try to understand the transverse structure of photon through transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) in quantum chromodynamics. We calculate all the possible time reversal photon TMDs using light-front wave functions. For this work, we have considered photon as a Fock-state of quark anti-quark pair. All the $9$ T-even TMDs have been presented in the overlap and explicit form of light-front wave functions using the helicity amplitudes. We observe that only $3$ TMDs are non-zero for the case of a real photon as compared to $8$ for virtual photon. We briefly discuss the unpolarized $f_1 (x,\textbf{k}_\perp)$, longitudinally polarized $g_{1L}(x,\textbf{k}^2_\perp)$, transversly polarized $h_1(x,\textbf{k}^2_\perp)$ and tensor polarized $f_{1LL}(x,\textbf{k}^2_\perp)$ TMDs for both real and virtual photon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of general $U(1)$ scenario, we demonstrate that the ultra high energy neutrinos recently detected by KM3NeT could originate from a decaying right handed neutrino dark matter (DM), with a mass of 440 PeV. Considering DM production via freeze-in, we delineate the parameter space that satisfies the observed relic abundance and also lies within the reach of multiple gravitational wave detectors. Our study provides a testable new physics scenario, enabled by multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality in $\tau^+ \tau^-$ at the LHC using Machine Learning for Neutrino Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have accumulated an unprecedented amount of data corresponding to a large variety of quantum states. Although searching for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics remains a high priority for the LHC program, precision measurements of the physical processes predicted in the Standard Model continue to lead us to a deeper understanding of nature at high energies. We carry out detailed simulations for the process $pp \to \tau^+\tau^- X$ to perform quantum tomography and to measure the quantum entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of the $\tau^+\tau^-$ two qubit state, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. By using advanced machine learning techniques for neutrino momentum reconstruction, we achieve precise measurements of the full spin density matrix, a critical advantage over previous studies limited by reconstruction challenges for missing momenta. Our analysis reveals a clear observation of Bell nonlocality with high statistical significance, surpassing 5$\sigma$, establishing $\tau^+ \tau^-$ as an ideal system for quantum information studies in high-energy collisions. Given its experimental feasibility and the high expected sensitivity for Bell nonlocality, we propose that $\tau^+ \tau^-$ should be regarded as the new benchmark system for quantum information studies at the LHC, complementing and extending the insights gained from the $t\bar{t}$ system.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Gell-Mann ~-~Low functions in quantum electrodynamics and in the Wess-Zumino model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive bounds $ |\frac{d\psi(\alpha)}{d\alpha}| \leq 1 $, $ \frac{d(\frac{d\psi(\alpha)}{d\alpha}\psi(\alpha))}{d\alpha} \leq 1 $
  on the GL (Gell-Mann ~-~Low) function $\psi(\alpha)$ from the Kallen-Lehmann dispersion representation in quantum electrodynamics.
  We also derive analogous bounds for the GL function in the Wess-Zumino model.
  The implications of the obtained inequalities are discussed. In particular, we obtain bounds on coupling
  constants in dark photon model and in dark matter model with vector $(B-L)$ messenger.</description>

      <title>Cascade topologies in rare charm decays and implications for CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CP violation observed in the hadronic decays of charmed mesons remains a puzzling open question for theorists. Calculations relying on the assumption of inelastic final-state interactions occurring between the pairs of pions and kaons fall short of the experimental value. It has been pointed out that a third channel of four pions can leave imprints on the CP asymmetries of the two-body decays. At the same time, plenty of data are available for the $4\pi$ decays of charmed mesons, as well as for the rare decays $D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$. With this motivation, we study the cascade topology $D^0\to a_1(1260)^+(\to \rho(770)^0\pi^+)\,\pi^-$, which has been measured to contribute significantly to the $4\pi$ decays, and estimate its effect on the branching ratio of the rare decays. We also explore the possibility of this topology contributing to the decay amplitude of $D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-$ and by extension to the related CP asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Modular Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the Standard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a modulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an underlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system-termed \emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial dynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze Higgs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its attractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular, we find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is introduced to V-QCD, a bottom-up holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model. Using a small isospin chemical potential we extract the symmetry energy in the model, finding excellent agreement with experimental results for some of the potentials. Extending the calculation for finite and arbitrary sized isospin chemical potentials, we construct beta-equilibrated neutron stars via the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations. We find, pleasingly, that the neutron stars passing the mass/radius and tidal deformability constraints are those with the potentials that also lead to excellent symmetry energies.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}}$ helicity amplitudes and transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently reported new results on the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition form factors using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within a coupled formalism based on the Dyson-Schwinger, Bethe-Salpeter, and Faddeev equations. In this work, we extend our investigation to the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition. Our computed transition form factors show reasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities. However, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a sharper variation than theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is expected, as these continuum QCD analyses account only for the quark-core of baryons, while low photon virtualities are dominated by meson cloud effects. We anticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI framework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and QCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and the contributions of scalar and vector diquarks.</description>

      <title>Implications of recent LHCb data on CPV in b-baryon four body decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent CPV observation, we investigate the CPV of b-baryon charmless four body decays under the U-spin symmetry. However, we find that only U-spin symmetry cannot provide effective predictions, particularly for $\Lambda_b$ decays. For giving more useful predictions, we also give a simple dynamic analysis. By counting the power($\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{\Lambda_{QCD}}{m_b}}$) of each topological diagram, we find that for the specific decay $B_b^2\to R(B_1^2 M^2 M^{\bar 2})M^2$, only one U-spin amplitude can contribute in the leading power. Then the effective prediction can be given as \begin{align}
  A_{CP}^{dir}(\Lambda_b^0 \to R( p \pi^- \pi^+ )\pi^-) = (-12.98 \pm 2.85)\%.\notag \end{align} Considering the $\Lambda_b$ can effectively produced in LHCb, we strongly encourage a more precise experimental investigation of it.</description>

      <title>A minimal Pati-Salam theory: from cosmic defects to gravitational waves and colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a minimal renormalizable Pati-Salam theory based on the $SU(4)_{\rm C}\,\times\,SU(2)_{\rm L}\,\times\,SU(2)_{\rm R}$ gauge group, with unification scale Higgs multiplets taken as $SU(2)_{\rm L}$ and $SU(2)_{\rm R}$ doublets, which lead to neutrino Dirac picture. Although a number of scalar particles could be light, even lying at the LHC energies, the unification scale is hopelessly out of reach in any foreseeable future. Moreover, phase transition in the early Universe leads to the production of magnetic monopoles and domain walls, both incompatible with the standard cosmological model. A small explicit breaking of the discrete left-right symmetry allows the domain walls to decay, and in the process possibly sweep away the monopoles, analogously to the previously discussed case of $SU(5)$ grand unified theory. This leaves an important imprint of gravitational waves, within the reach of next generation searches, correlated with monopole detection and new light particles at collider energies. The theory has a dark matter candidate in the form of an inert scalar doublet, with a mass below TeV, which can further trigger electroweak baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>A Dilaton Sum Rule for the Conformal Anomaly Form Factor in QCD at Order $\alpha_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an off-shell dispersive analysis of the graviton-gluon-gluon \( TJJ \) vertex, extending previous QED and QCD results of this interaction, and show that it satisfies a conformal anomaly sum rule at one-loop, under the most general kinematical conditions. The conformal anomaly form factor emerges from the trace sector of the interaction and its absorptive amplitude is constrained by an area law similarly to the chiral and gravitational anomaly cases. Building on our previous analysis of those anomalies, we illustrate the patterns of cancelation between the localized and the continuum contributions to the spectral density of this form factor. As in the chiral/gravitational case, a spectral flow localizes the exchanged intermediate state at zero momentum transfer as the quark mass is sent to zero. The perturbative analysis indicates that sum rules are central dynamical features of anomaly interactions, and the coupling or the decoupling of the associated dilaton poles are correlated with the saturation of the sum rule either by a pole or by a dispersive cut. In the conformal and on-shell limit, the particle pole interaction describes a nonlocal S-matrix element entirely supported on the light-cone, with contribution both from the dilaton pole in the trace sector and from other sectors of the correlator, except for flavour number $n_f=3$ quarks $ u,d,s$, where only the dilaton pole in the trace sector appears.</description>

      <title>Classification of Modular Symmetries in Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic String theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23741v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study modular symmetries in non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories on toroidal backgrounds with Wilson line modulus, constructed by stringy Scherk-Schwartz compactification. In particular, we focus on a subgroup of the T-duality group $O(D+16,D,\mathbb{Z})$ with $D=2$ given by an outer automorphism of the Narain lattice, which can be mapped to the Siegel modular group $\mathrm{Sp}(4,\mathbb{Z})$. We classify the modular symmetries and a $CP$-like symmetry on $T^2$ and its orbifolds with symmetric and asymmetric orbifold twists. It turns out that the non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories only enjoy a part of modular symmetries in contrast to supersymmetric ones. Furthermore, the gauge symmetry is maximally enhanced at fixed points of modular symmetries on $T^2$ on which we analyze the vacuum structure of eight-dimensional tachyon-free vacua.</description>

      <title>LEP3: A High-Luminosity e+e- Higgs and ElectroweakFactory in the LHC Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As stated in the 2019 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), it is of the utmost importance that the HL-LHC upgrade of the accelerator and the experiments be successfully completed in a timely manner. All necessary efforts should be devoted to achieving this goal. We also recall two of the principal recommendations of the 2019 ESPP for future accelerator initiatives, namely that 1) An electron-positron Higgs factory is the highest priority for the next collider (Rec. c). 2) Europe, together with its international partners, should investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with a centre-of-mass energy of at least 100 TeV and with an electron-positron Higgs and electroweak factory as a possible first stage (Rec. e). A major objective in particle physics is always to operate an accelerator that allows a leap of an order of magnitude in the constituent centre-of-mass energy with respect to the previous one. We support FCC-ee and FCC-hh as the preferred option for CERN future, as it addresses both of the above recommendations.
  The guidance for the 2025 ESPP requests, in addition to the preferred option, the inclusion of ``prioritised alternatives to be pursued if the chosen preferred option turns out not to be feasible or competitive''. Proposed alternatives to the preferred FCC option include linear, muon colliders and LHeC accelerators. In response to this request we propose reusing the existing LHC tunnel for an electron-positron collider, called LEP3, as a back-up alternative if the FCC cannot proceed. LEP3 leverages much of the R\&amp;D conducted for FCC-ee, offers high-precision studies of Z, W, and Higgs bosons below the tt threshold, and offers potential physics performance comparable or superior to other fallback options at a lower cost while supporting continued R\&amp;D towards a next-generation energy frontier machine.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping LSS perturbation theory beyond third order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bootstrap techniques relying on the constraints imposed by Extended Galilean Invariance (EGI), have proved to be very useful in the context of perturbation theory of the Large Scale Structure (LSS). It has been formulated in both the Eulerian as well as Lagrangian space. While the Eulerian bootstrap formalism has been successfully applied to both tracer and matter kernels, the application of bootstrap methods in Lagrangian space has so far been restricted to matter. Up to third order, it has been shown that implementing EGI constraints in Eulerian space fully reproduces the bias expansion for tracers. Previous studies have demonstrated that time non-locality affects the bias expansion in a non-trivial way starting from fifth order. Motivated by this fact, we extend the bootstrap approach upto fifth order in both Eulerian and Lagrangian space and demonstrate that it fully captures the time non-local effects. For this, we generalize the Lagrangian bootstrap for tracers, and found that it agrees with the corresponding results obtained in Eulerian space. One of the major challenges in implementing EGI constraints in Eulerian space, is to systematically find out all the "spurious poles" and make them vanish. We have proposed a method that bypasses this difficulty making the procedure tractable at higher orders. From Lagrangian perspective, we have identified coefficients in the tracer kernel whose ratios are independent of tracer properties and may serve as direct probes of the underlying cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Steven Weinberg productive scientific life teaches us many things, one of the most important of which is the power of his example. This essay contains personal reminiscences and a speculation about gravitational wave propagation based on one of his very last papers -- as seems fitting, given his penchant for putting interesting physics into the essays he wrote for other luminaries over the years. (See arXiv:2502.10979 [physics.hist-ph] for a less personal summary of his main scientific accomplishments.)</description>

      <title>Synergies between a U.S.-based Electron-Ion Collider and European Research in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document is submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update (ESPPU). The U.S.-based Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) aims at understanding how the complex dynamics of confined quarks and gluons makes up nucleons, nuclei and all visible matter, and determines their macroscopic properties. In April 2024, the EIC project received approval for critical-decision 3A (CD-3A) allowing for Long-Lead Procurement, bringing its realization another step closer. The ePIC Collaboration was established in July 2022 around the realization of a general purpose detector at the EIC. The EIC is based in U.S.A. but is characterized as a genuine international project. In fact, a large group of European scientists is already involved in the EIC community: currently, about a quarter of the EIC User Group (consisting of over 1500 scientists) and 29% of the ePIC Collaboration (consisting of $\sim$1000 members) is based in Europe. This European involvement is not only an important driver of the EIC, but can also be beneficial to a number of related ongoing and planned particle physics experiments at CERN. In this document, the connections between the scientific questions addressed at CERN and at the EIC are outlined. The aim is to highlight how the many synergies between the CERN Particle Physics research and the EIC project will foster progress at the forefront of collider physics.</description>

      <title>Bounds on dilaton and complex structure moduli values for perturbative control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String compactification in the framework of the low energy effective supergravity requires the perturbative control in both the large volume and the weak coupling expansions. However, if the K\"ahler potential respects the SL$(2, \mathbb{Z})$ (Sp$(2(h^{2,1}+1))$) symmetry of the axio-dilaton (complex structure moduli) even at the quantum level, the corrected K\"ahler potential generated by the coupling of the dilaton (complex structure moduli) to some lattice structure may diverge in the large field limit, resulting in the lost of the perturbative control. As can be found in the explicitly calculable models, such a divergence may not be affected by the symmetry breaking by, for example, the gauge fields in the brane. This sets the upper bounds on the field values of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli determined by the volume of the internal manifold and the string coupling constant, hence the Kaluza-Klein and the string mass scales. The form and the interpretation of these bounds are quite similar to those of the distance conjecture, preventing the descent of a tower of states by the upper bounds on the moduli values.</description>

      <title>Proton cumulants from hydrodynamics in light of new STAR data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New measurements of proton number cumulants from the Beam Energy Scan Phase II (BES-II) program at RHIC by the STAR Collaboration provide unprecedented precision and insights into the properties of strongly interacting matter. This report discusses the measurements in the context of predictions from hydrodynamics, emphasizing the enhanced sensitivity of factorial cumulants and their implications for the search for the QCD critical point. The experimental data shows enhancement of second-order factorial cumulants and suppression of third-order factorial cumulants relative to the non-critical baseline at $7.7 &lt; \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \lesssim 10$ GeV. We discuss implications of this observation for the possible location of the critical point in the QCD phase diagram and opportunities for future measurements of acceptance dependence of factorial cumulants.</description>

      <title>AI-Newton: A Concept-Driven Physical Law Discovery System without Prior Physical Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current limitations in human scientific discovery necessitate a new research paradigm. While advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a highly promising solution, enabling AI to emulate human-like scientific discovery remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose AI-Newton, a concept-driven discovery system capable of autonomously deriving physical laws from raw data -- without supervision or prior physical knowledge. The system integrates a knowledge base and knowledge representation centered on physical concepts, along with an autonomous discovery workflow. As a proof of concept, we apply AI-Newton to a large set of Newtonian mechanics problems. Given experimental data with noise, the system successfully rediscovers fundamental laws, including Newton's second law, energy conservation and law of gravitation, using autonomously defined concepts. This achievement marks a significant step toward AI-driven autonomous scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Enhancing European Cooperation in the Search for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for dark matter is an exciting topic that is pursued in different communities over a wide range of masses and using a variety of experimental approaches. The result is a strongly correlated matrix of activities across Europe and beyond, both on the experimental and the theoretical side. We suggest to encourage and foster the collaboration of the involved institutions on technical, scientific and organisational level, in order to realise the synergies that are required to increase the impact of dark matter research and to cope with the increasing experiment sizes. The suggested network -- loosely titled "DMInfraNet" -- could be realised as a new initiative of the European strategy or be based on existing structures like iDMEu or DRD. The network can also serve as a nucleus for future joint funding proposals.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courand-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>Energy Density Functional of Confined Quarks: an Improved Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a robust framework for modeling interacting many-body systems, including the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used ansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U \propto n^{\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local energy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities to $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction.</description>

      <title>Is Lorentz invariance violation found?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$, which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A new 4D lattice QCD equation of state: extended density coverage from a generalized $T^\prime$-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new equation of state for QCD in which the temperature $T$ and the three chemical potentials for baryon number $\mu_B$, electric charge $\mu_Q$ and strangeness $\mu_S$ can be varied independently. This result is based on a generalization of the $T'$-expansion scheme, thanks to which the diagonal $\mu_B$ extrapolation was pushed up to a baryo-chemical potential $\mu_B/T \sim 3.5$ for the first time. This considerably extended the coverage of the Taylor expansion, limited to $\mu_B/T &lt; 2.5-3$. As a consequence, we are able to offer a substantially larger coverage of the four-dimensional QCD phase diagram as well, compared to previously available Taylor expansion results. Our results are based on new continuum estimated lattice results on the full set of second and fourth order fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both the shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the quasinormal modes-graybody factors correspondence's in the context of the Hawking spectra for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between black shadows and graybody factors by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are thereof discussed. This study opens new perspectives, by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>

      <title>Interference with Gravitational Instability: Hot and Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave or fuzzy dark matter produced with high momenta behaves in many ways like hot particle dark matter while also possessing seemingly different phenomenology due to wave interference. We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.08376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the nonrelativistic QCD framework to explore the nature of the newly discovered di-$J/\psi$ resonances. Assuming them as either molecule-like states or tetraquarks, we calculated their hadroproduction cross sections at the LHC. We find that the observed resonances are most likely spin-2 particles, and there should exist their spin-0 counterparts near these resonances. The ratio of production cross sections of the observed resonances to the latent spin-0 ones are also presented, which might help to distinguish molecule-like states from tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>Accretion, Evaporation and Superradiance Phase Diagram of (Primordial) Black Holes and $10^{-21}-10^{21}$ eV Scalar, Vector, Tensor Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the accretion, evaporation and superradiance phase diagram of astrophysical and primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-33}-10^{11} \, M_\odot $. This black hole mass range corresponds to production of $10^{-21} - 10^{21}$ eV particles for superradiance (bosons) and evaporation (bosons and fermions). Only accretion and superradiance processes are relevant for heavy black holes, on the other hand for light black holes of primordial origin, all three processes can be relevant. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for black hole spin values as low as $10^{-9}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe 2-9 orders of magnitude of mass parameter space depending on the nature of the perturbations that are scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2. If spinning black holes are observed and superradiance is not observed, possibly due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion/scalar decay constant and energy density. We generalize these bounds for vector and spin-2 fields.</description>

      <title>Post-inflationary production of particle Dark Matter: non-minimal Natural and Coleman--Weinberg inflationary scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of non-thermal fermionic dark matter particles during the reheating era following slow roll inflation, driven by inflaton $\varphi$ non-minimally coupled to the curvature scalar, $\mathcal{R}$. Two types of non-minimal couplings are considered: $\xi\varphi^2\cal{R}$ for both natural (referred to as NM-N) and for Coleman-Weinberg (referred to as NM-CW) inflation, and $\alpha\left(1+\cos(\frac{\varphi}{f_a})\right)$ only for natural inflation (referred to as NMP-N), where $\alpha$ and $\xi$ are dimensionless parameters and $f_a$ is an energy scale. We determine benchmark values for slow roll inflationary scenarios satisfying current bounds from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation measurement and find the mass of inflaton to be $m_\phi\sim {\cal O}\left(10^{12}\right) \text{GeV}$ for all three inflationary scenarios and tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r\sim 0.0177$ (for NM-N), $\sim 0.0097$ (for NMP-N), and $r\sim 0.0157$ (for NM-CW) which fall inside $1-\sigma$ contour on scalar spectral index versus $r$ plane of Planck2018+BICEP3+KeckArray2018 joint analysis, and can be probed by future CMN~observations e.g. Simons Observatory. We then show that dark matter particles produced from the decay of inflaton can fully match the present-day cold dark matter (CDM) yield, as well as other cosmological constraints, if the coupling value between inflaton and dark matter, $y_\chi$, and the dark matter mass, $m_\chi$, are within the range $10^{-1}\gtrsim y_\chi\gtrsim 10^{-20}$ for NM-N and NMP-N ($10^{-4}\gtrsim y_\chi\gtrsim 10^{-20}$ for NM-CW) and ${\cal O}\left(\text{keV}\right)\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim m_\phi/2$ (for NM-N, NMP-N, and NM-CW). The exact range of $y_\chi$ and $m_\chi$ varies with different benchmark values as well as parameters of inflation, like energy scale of inflation and $r$, some of which are within reach of next-generation CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Coherent Self-Interactions of Dark Matter in the Bullet Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many models of dark matter include self-interactions beyond gravity. A variety of astrophysical observations have previously been used to place limits on the strength of such self-interactions. However, previous works have generally focused either on short-range interactions resulting in individual dark matter particles scattering from one another, or on effectively infinite-range interactions which sum over entire dark matter halos. In this work, we focus on the intermediate regime: forces with range much larger than dark matter particles' inter-particle spacing, but still shorter than the length scales of known halos. We show that gradients in the dark matter density of such halos would still lead to observable effects. We focus primarily on effects in the Bullet Cluster, where finite-range forces would lead either to a modification of the collision velocity of the cluster or to a separation of the dark matter and the galaxies of each cluster after the collision. We also consider constraints from the binding of ultrafaint dwarf galaxy halos, and from gravitational lensing of the Abell 370 cluster. Taken together, these observations allow us to set the strongest constraints on dark matter self-interactions over many orders of magnitude in range below $\sim10$ kpc, surpassing existing limits by orders of magnitude throughout.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quantum Yang--Mills at finite temperature beyond lattice: a Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a Dyson--Schwinger approach, we perform an analysis of the non-trivial ground state of thermal $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory in the non-perturbative regime where chiral symmetry is dynamically broken by a mass gap. Basic thermodynamic observables such as energy density and pressure are derived analytically, using Jacobi elliptic functions. The results are compared with lattice results. Good agreement is found at low temperatures, providing a viable scenario of a gas of massive glue states populating higher levels of the spectrum of the theory. At high temperatures a scenario without glue states consistent with a massive scalar field is observed, showing an interesting agreement with lattice data. The possibility is discussed that the results derived in this analysis open up a novel pathway beyond lattice to precision studies of phase transitions with false vacuum and cosmological relics that depend on the equations of state in strong coupled gauge theories of the type of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Recent $B^+ \!\to K^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ excess and muon $g-2$ illuminating light dark sector with Higgs portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle II collaboration recently announced that they observed the $B^+ \!\to K^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ decay process for the first time. This dineutrino mode of $B^+ \!\to K^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ has been theoretically identified as a very clean channel. However, their result encounters a $2.7{}^{}\sigma$ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) calculation. On the other hand, last year, Fermilab released new data on muon $g-2$ away from the SM expectation with $5{}^{}\sigma$. In this letter, we study the simplest UV-complete $\text{U}(1)_{\textsf{L}_\mu - \textsf{L}_\tau}^{}$-charged complex scalar Dark Matter (DM) model. Thanks to the existence of light dark Higgs boson and light dark photon, we can explain the observed relic density of DM and resolve the results reported by both Belle II and Fermilab experiments simultaneously. As a byproduct, the Hubble tension is alleviated by taking $\Delta N_\textsf{eff}^{} \simeq 0.3$ induced by the light dark photon.</description>

      <title>Deviation from $\mu-\tau$ Symmetry with New Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two new predictive neutrino mass matrix textures that deviate from $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry and explore their phenomenological implications. These textures are significant due to their predictive nature and the unique approach they introduce for breaking the $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry. Both textures predict six physical parameters and impose sharp constraints on $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta$, considering both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. In addition, we realize the textures in their exact form within the framework of the seesaw mechanism, based on the $SU(2)_L \times A_4 \times Z_3$ symmetry group.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Physical Priors into Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new machine-learning-based anomaly detection strategy for comparing data with a background-only reference (a form of weak supervision). The sensitivity of previous strategies degrades significantly when the signal is too rare or there are many unhelpful features. Our Prior-Assisted Weak Supervision (PAWS) method incorporates information from a class of signal models to significantly enhance the search sensitivity of weakly supervised approaches. As long as the true signal is in the pre-specified class, PAWS matches the sensitivity of a dedicated, fully supervised method without specifying the exact parameters ahead of time. On the benchmark LHC Olympics anomaly detection dataset, our mix of semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning is able to extend the sensitivity over previous methods by a factor of 10 in cross section. Furthermore, if we add irrelevant (noise) dimensions to the inputs, classical methods degrade by another factor of 10 in cross section while PAWS remains insensitive to noise. This new approach could be applied in a number of scenarios and pushes the frontier of sensitivity between completely model-agnostic approaches and fully model-specific searches.</description>

      <title>Probing light sterile neutrinos in left-right symmetric models with displaced vertices and neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An investigation of relatively light (GeV-scale), long-lived right-handed neutrinos is performed within minimal left-right symmetric models using the neutrino-extended Standard Model Effective Field Theory framework. Light sterile neutrinos can be produced through rare decays of kaons, $D$-mesons, and $B$-mesons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) of Fermilab. Their decays could result in displaced vertices, which can be reconstructed. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, we assess the sensitivities of the future LHC far-detector experiments ANUBIS, CODEX-b, FACET, FASER(2), MoEDAL-MAPP1(2), MATHUSLA, the recently approved beam-dump experiment SHiP, and the upcoming neutrino experiment DUNE at the LBNF, to the right-handed gauge-boson mass $M_{W_R}$ as functions of neutrino masses. We find that DUNE and SHiP could be sensitive to right-handed gauge-boson masses up to $\sim 25$ TeV. We compare this reach to indirect searches such as neutrinoless double beta decay, finding that displaced-vertex searches are very competitive.</description>

      <title>Emergence of New Systematics for Open Charm Production in High Energy Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the production systematics of open charm hadron yields in high-energy collisions and their description based on the Statistical Hadronization Model of charm (SHMc). The rapidity density of $D^0, D^+, D^{*+}, D_s^+$ mesons and $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons in heavy ion and proton-proton collisions is analyzed for different collision energies and centralities. The SHMc is extended to open charm production in minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions. In this context, we use the link established in [1,2], between the rapidity density of open charm hadron yields, $dN_i/dy$, and the rapidity density of charm-anticharm quark pairs, $dN_{c\bar c}/dy$. We demonstrate that, in pp, pA and AA collisions, $dN_i/dy$ scales in leading order with $dN_{c\bar c}/d\eta$ and for open charm mesons, $D^0,D^+$ and $D^{*+}$ the slope coefficient is quantified by the appropriate thermal density ratio calculated in the SHMc at the chiral crossover temperature, $T_c=156.5$ MeV. The slope coefficient for $dN_{\Lambda_c^+}/dy$ differs at $T_c$ by a factor of $1.97\pm 0.14$ which is attributed to missing charmed-baryon resonances in the PDG. It is also shown that $dN_i/dy$ exhibits power-law scaling with the charged-particle pseudo-rapidity density in high energy collisions and within uncertainties. Furthermore, presently available data on different ratios of open charm rapidity densities in high-energy collisions are independent of collision energy and system size, as expected in the SHMc.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Long-Ranged Interactions Between Dark Matter and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter's existence is known thanks to its gravitational interaction with Standard Model particles, but it remains unknown whether this is the only force present between them. While many searches for such new interactions with dark matter focus on short-range, contact-like interactions, it is also possible that there exist weak, long-ranged forces between dark matter and the Standard Model. In this work, we present two types of constraints on such new interactions. First, we consider constraints arising from the fact that such a force would also induce long range interactions between Standard Model particles themselves, as well as between dark matter particles themselves. Combining the constraints on these individual forces generally sets the strongest constraints available on new Standard Model-dark matter interactions. Second, we consider the possibility of constraining new long-ranged interactions between dark matter and the Standard Model using the effects of dynamical friction in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, especially Segue I. Such new interactions would accelerate the transfer of kinetic energy from stars to their surrounding dark matter, slowly reducing their orbits; the present-day stellar half-light radius of Segue I therefore allows us to exclude new forces which would have reduced stars' orbital radii below this scale by now.</description>

      <title>BBN Constraint on Heavy Neutrino Production and Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint on heavy neutrino that is a mixture of gauge singlet fermion and active neutrinos in the Standard Model. We work in the minimal model with only two parameters, the heavy neutrino mass $m_4$ and the mixing parameter $|U_{a4}|^2$, where $a=e$, $\mu$, or $\tau$ stands for the active neutrino flavor. We show that both the early universe production mechanism and decay products of the heavy neutrino are determined by $m_4$ and $|U_{a4}|^2$, with little room for further assumptions. This predictivity allows us to present a portrait of the entire BBN excluded parameter space. Our analysis includes various effects including temporary matter domination, energy injections in the form of charged mesons, photons and light neutrinos. The BBN constraint is complementary to terrestrial search for heavy neutrinos (heavy neutral leptons) behind the origin of neutrino masses and portal to the dark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present quantitative predictions for the nuclear modification factor in both small and peripheral systems from a pQCD-based energy loss model that is constrained by light- and heavy-flavor suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions. We find nearly identical suppression for central $p / d + A$ collisions as for peripheral $A + A$ collisions, quantitatively consistent with the measured 20% suppression of neutral pions produced in $d + \mathrm{Au}$ collisions by PHENIX, but dramatically inconsistent with the measured 20% enhancement of charged hadrons produced in $p + \mathrm{Pb}$ collisions by ATLAS. We demonstrate that this equivalence of central small system suppression and peripheral large system suppression is insensitive to the underlying energy loss model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory, we assess the importance of including a finite size for the target on observables sensitive to small-$x$ evolution. To this end, we study the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation with impact-parameter dependence in the initial condition. We demonstrate that neglecting the dependence on the impact parameter can result in overestimated saturation effects for protons, while it has little effect for heavy nuclei at the energies available at current experiments. When fixing the nonperturbative parameters to the energy dependence of the exclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction cross section with proton targets, predictions for lead targets are not sensitive to the applied running-coupling prescription, the scheme chosen to resum large transverse logarithms in the BK equation, or the infrared regulator in the evolution.</description>

      <title>New parameter region in sterile neutrino searches: a scenario to alleviate cosmological neutrino mass bound and its testability at oscillation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-precision cosmological data tighten the bound to neutrino masses and start rising a tension to the results of lab-experiment measurements, which may hint new physics in the role of neutrinos during the structure formation in the universe. A scenario with massless sterile neutrinos was proposed to alleviate the cosmological bound and recover the concordance in the measurements of neutrino masses. We revisit the scenario and discuss its testability at oscillation experiments. We find that the scenario is viable with a large active-sterile mixing that is testable at oscillation experiments. We present a numerical estimation of the sensitivity reach of the IceCube atmospheric neutrino observation to a sterile neutrino with a mass lighter than active neutrinos for the first time. IceCube shows a good sensitivity to the active-sterile mixing at the mass-square difference with a size of $\sim 0.1$ eV$^{2}$ in the case of the \textit{inverted-mass-ordering sterile neutrino}, which is forbidden under the assumption of the standard cosmology but is allowed thanks to the alleviation of the cosmological bound in this scenario.</description>

Abstract: The gauge-singlet right-handed neutrinos would be essential to explain tiny masses of active neutrinos. We consider the effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with these fields under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this framework, we provide a comprehensive study for the phenomenological consequences of various dimension six interactions employing various high and low energy observables. These include the neutrino mass itself, constraints from electroweak precision test and collider searches for lepton or jet plus missing energy, as well as decays of proton, meson, tau and top. We also study their astrophysical and cosmological implications for stellar cooling and relativistic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor.</description>

      <title>Rationalisation of multiple square roots in Feynman integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman integrals are very often computed from their differential equations. It is not uncommon that the $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation contains only dlog-forms with algebraic arguments, where the algebraic part is given by (multiple) square roots. It is well-known that if all square roots are simultaneously rationalisable, the Feynman integrals can be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. This is a sufficient, but not a necessary criterium. In this paper we investigate weaker requirements. We discuss under which conditions we may use different rationalisations in different parts of the calculation. In particular we show that we may use different rationalisations if they correspond to different parameterisations of the same integration path. We present a non-trivial example -- the one-loop pentagon function with three adjacent massive external legs involving seven square roots -- where this technique can be used to express the result in terms of multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>A short review on the compositeness of the $X(3872)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $X(3872)$ could be a shallow $D\bar D^*$ bound state, a compact four-quark state, or a partially composite particle, i.e. a superposition of the two. We will review how these hypotheses could be tested experimentally, examining especially the cases in which the $X$ is a pure bound state or a pure compact tetraquark. Data on $X\to D\bar D\pi$ decays are compared with the analysis of the $X$ lineshape. The pure bound state hypothesis corresponds to a well-defined region in parameter space defined by the width of the $D^*$ versus the binding energy of the $X$. As for the $X$ lineshape, we observe that the currently available experimental analysis tests the compatibility with the compact hypothesis for the $X$. We propose how to extend the analysis to examine the molecular or the partially composite hypotheses. We also review the analysis on the radiative decays of the $X$ including pion corrections confirming some conclusions reached in the literature on the use of the universal wave function description for the molecular $X$.</description>

      <title>Spin precession and neutrino helicity flip in various spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study spin precession of neutral particles freely moving in spacetime. We first derive the formula describing spin precession within a general stationary and axisymmetric spacetime. We then apply our formula to study spin precession of neutral spinning particles moving within various spacetimes that are among the most ubiquitous ones found in the literature. Our results are then used to extract the helicity flip probability for neutrinos propagating in each one of those selected spacetimes. It is found that low-energy neutrinos acquire a spin-flip probability that is as large as unity in all the spacetimes considered here. The remarkable result, however, is that while spin-flip probability for high-energy neutrinos remains insignificant in most of these spacetimes, some of them do allow spin-flip probability to reach unity even for high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Probing the couplings of an axion-like particle with leptons via three-lepton final state processes at future $e^{-}p$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-like particle (ALP) is one of the best motivated particles beyond the Standard Model (SM). We explore the possibility of detecting the couplings of ALP with leptons via three-lepton final state processes $e^- p \to e^- j a~(a \to \ell^+ \ell^-)$ at the LHeC (FCC-eh). For completeness, we investigate the cases where the ALP decays not only into electron and muon pairs but also into tau pairs, and perform a detailed simulation for the decays of taus. We find that the prospective sensitivities of the LHeC (FCC-eh) with the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1.3~(3.5)$ TeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=1~ (2)$ ab$^{-1}$ to the ALP-lepton couplings are not only stronger than some existing bounds of the LHC and LEP but also complementary to the expected bounds of the CEPC and FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Supernova and neutron-star limits on large extra dimensions reexamined</title>

      <description>arXiv:hep-ph/0304029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theories with large extra dimensions, supernova (SN) cores are powerful sources of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons. A large fraction of these massive particles are gravitationally retained by the newly born neutron star (NS). The subsequent slow KK decays produce potentially observable gamma rays and heat the NS. We here show that the back-absorption of the gravitationally trapped KK gravitons does not significantly change our previous limits. We calculate the graviton emission rate in a nuclear medium by combining the low-energy classical bremsstrahlung rate with detailed-balancing arguments. This approach reproduces the previous thermal emission rate, but it is much simpler and allows for a calculation of the absorption rate by a trivial phase-space transformation. We derive systematically the dependence of the SN and NS limits on the number of extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>Detecting Extragalactic Axion-like Dark Matter with Polarization Measurements of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are one of the promising dark matter (DM) candidates. A prevalent method to detect axion-like DM is to seek periodic oscillation in the polarization angles (PAs) of linearly polarized light emitted from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use the time-resolved polarization measurements of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20220912A, detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for extragalactic axion-like DM. Given a DM density profile of FRB 20220912A's host, we obtain upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant of $g_{a \gamma}&lt;(3.4 \times 10^{-11}-1.9\times 10^{-9})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP masses $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-21}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Persistent polarimetric observations with FAST would extend the constraints to lower masses. Although the $g_{a \gamma}$ constraints derived from FRBs are less competitive than those from other methods, FRBs offer an alternative way to detect axion-like DM on extragalactic distance scales, complementary to galactic DM probes.</description>

      <title>The mass effect -- Variations of the electron mass and their impact on cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of time variations of the electron mass in cosmology, showing that such variations allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension, from the current $\sim5\sigma$ significance, down to between $3.4\sigma$ and $1.0\sigma$ significance, depending on the precise model and data. Electron mass variations are preferred by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in combination with the latest results on baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and type Ia supernovae at a level of significance between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data. This preference for a model involving an electron mass variation is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model.</description>

      <title>Quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for multijet clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet clustering or reconstruction is a crucial component at high energy colliders, a procedure to identify sprays of collimated particles originating from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons. It is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem and requires intensive computing resources. In this study, we formulate jet reconstruction as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and introduce novel quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for clustering multiple jets in electron-positron collision events. One of these quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, ballistic simulated bifurcation, overcomes problems previously observed in multijet clustering with quantum-annealing approaches. We find that both the distance defined in the QUBO matrix and the prediction power of the QUBO solvers have crucial impacts on the multijet clustering performance. This study opens up a new approach to globally reconstructing multijet beyond dijet in one go, in contrast to the traditional iterative method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear response of a Schwarzschild black hole to an external quadrupolar perturbation is studied in analogy to a mechanical electrodynamical system, with the goal to describe the gravitational polarizability. Its causality properties imply dispersion relations that relate fluctuation and dissipative properties. We review and combine results obtained via the Regge-Wheeler equation on one side and a perturbative, worldline effective field theory description on the other, obtaining a consistent description of the dispersion relations for the gravitational polarizability of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the classical part of the 2-point correlation function of the black hole multipole depends on the boundary conditions of the space-time the black hole is immersed in, which is relevant for the dispersion relations considered.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in high-temperature lattice QCD with (u, d, s, c, b) optimal domain-wall quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial $ z $-correlators of meson operators in $ N_f=2+1+1+1 $ lattice QCD with optimal domain-wall quarks across eight temperatures ranging from 325 to 3250 MeV. The meson operators include a complete set of Dirac bilinears for ten flavor combinations. Our findings reveal a hierarchical restoration of chiral symmetry in QCD with $ (u, d, s, c, b) $ quarks, progressing sequentially from $ SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_A $ to $ SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R \times U(1)_A $, then to $ SU(4)_L \times SU(4)_R \times U(1)_A $, and finally to $ SU(5)_L \times SU(5)_R \times U(1)_A $ as the temperature increases. Additionally, we explore the emergence of the $ SU(2)_{CS} $ chiral-spin symmetry and compare the temperature windows for all flavor combinations. Our results indicate that the temperature windows for the emergent $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry are primarily dominated by the $ \bar{u} b $ and $ \bar{s} b $ sectors.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently studied spin precession in various stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes and applied it to the case of neutrinos propagating in those spacetimes. In this paper, the study of spin precession is extended to the case of a spinning particle propagating within the spacetime of a time-dependent gravitational plane wave. First, the angular velocity of spin precession of a particle propagating in a geodesic along an arbitrary direction relative to the gravitational wave is derived. Our general result is then used to derive the helicity flip probability for neutrinos freely propagating along such an arbitrary direction within the gravitational wave.</description>
