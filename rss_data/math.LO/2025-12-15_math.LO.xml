      <title>A constructive approach to the double-categorical small object argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bourke and Garner described how to cofibrantly generate algebraic weak factorisation systems by a small double category of morphisms. However they did not give an explicit construction of the resulting factorisations as in the classical small object argument. In this paper we give such an explicit construction, as the colimit of a chain, which makes the result applicable in constructive settings; in particular, our methods provide a constructive proof that the effective Kan fibrations introduced by Van den Berg and Faber appear as the right class of an algebraic weak factorisation system.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Halin's end-degree Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11841v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new instances of Halin's end degree conjecture (HC) in ZFC. In particular, we show that there is a proper class of cardinals kappa for which Halin's conjecture holds, answering two questions posed by Geschke, Kurkofka, Melcher, and Pitz (2023). We also investigate the relationship between HC and the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis, deriving consistency strength from failures of the former. Moreover, we verify that Halin's conjecture fails on finite intervals of successors of singular cardinals in Merimovich's model, yielding a new independence result concerning HC.</description>

      <title>Finitely additive measures on Boolean algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we conduct a detailed study of \emph{finitely additive measures} (fams) in the context of Boolean algebras, focusing on three specific topics: freeness and approximation, existence and extension criteria, and integration theory. In the first topic, we present a classification of \emph{free} finitely additive measures, that is, those for which the measure of finite sets is zero, in terms of approximation to uniform probability measures. This inspires a weaker version of this notion, which we call the \emph{uniform approximation property}, characterized in terms of freeness and another well-determined type of fams we call \emph{uniformly supported}. In the second topic, we study new criteria for the existence and extension of finitely additive measures. In particular, we provide an extension of the so-called \emph{compatibility theorem} -- which characterizes when two finitely additive measures can be extended -- yielding a precise and compact characterization of when three finitely additive measures can be simultaneously extended, under the assumption that one of them is an ultrafilter. Finally, we study a Riemann-type integration theory on fields of sets with respect to finitely additive measures, allowing us to extend and generalize some classical concepts and results from real analysis, such as Riemann integration over rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and the Jordan measure. We also generalize the extension criteria for fams allowing desired values of integrals of a given set of functions. At the end, we explore the connection between integration in fields of sets and the Lebesgue integration in the Stone space of the corresponding field, where we establish a characterization of integrability in the sense of the Lebesgue-Vitali theorem, which follows as a consequence of our results.</description>

      <title>Definable Galois theory for bimeromorphic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The outlines of a "Galois theory" for bimeromorphic geometry is here developed, via the study of model-theoretic definable binding groups in the theory CCM of compact complex spaces. As an application, a structure theorem about principal meromorphic bundles with algebraic structure group, and admitting no horizontal subvarieties, is deduced. Examples of algebraic groups arising as binding groups are provided, as is a characterisation of when they are linear. Using binding groups in CCM it is shown that, in contrast to the situation in differentially closed fields, there are many algebraic groups which admit nontrivial definable torsors over acl-closed sets in the theory DCCM of existentially closed differential CCM-structures. A self-contained exposition of the binding group theorem in totally transcendental theories, that emphasises the bitorsorial nature of the construction, is also included.</description>

      <title>Finite axiomatization of $\textbf{GL}\times\textbf{S5}$ and $\textbf{Grz}\times\textbf{S5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that $\mathbf{GL} \times \mathbf{S5}$ is product matching, and that $\mathbf{Grz} \times \mathbf{S5}$ is axiomatizable by adding to $[\mathbf{Grz},\mathbf{S5}]$ the G\"odel translation of the monadic Casari formula. This settles the question of the finite axiomatizability of these logics posed by Gabbay and Shehtman (1998).</description>

      <title>Quantum set theory: quantum conditionals and order of observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A difficulty in quantum logic is the well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary operation for conditional among three principal candidates called the Sasaki, the contrapositive Sasaki, and the relevance conditional, mainly chosen from syntactical grounds. A fundamental problem remains to clarify their semantical differences manifest in operational concepts in quantum theory. Here, we attempt such an analysis through quantum set theory, developing models of quantum set theory built upon quantum logics with those three conditionals, each of which defines different quantum logical truth-value assignment for set theoretical statements. We show that each of them satisfies the transfer principle to determine the truth values of theorems of the ZFC set theory and defines the internal reals bijectively corresponding to the observables of the quantum system under consideration. Then, the truth values of their equality relations are identical irrespective of the chosen conditionals. Interestingly, however, their order relations exhibit a strong dependence on the specific conditional employed, while the order relation attains full truth value if and only if Olson's spectral order relation holds. We further characterize the order relation in terms of experimentally accessible relations for outcomes of successive projective measurements of the corresponding observables, showing that each choice has its own operational meaning with symmetry between the Sasaki and the contrapositive Sasaki conditionals, in contrast to the majority view that favors the Sasaki conditional. Our findings reveal that quantum set theory yields empirically testable predictions concerning state-dependent binary relations between quantum observables, thereby extending Born's probabilistic interpretation from propositions to relations.</description>

      <title>The Diophantine problem in isotropic reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We begin to study model-theoretic properties of non-split isotropic reductive group schemes. In this paper we show that the base ring $K$ is e-interpretable in the point group $G(K)$ of every sufficiently isotropic reductive group scheme $G$. In particular, the Diophantine problems in $K$ and $G(K)$ are equivalent. We also compute the centralizer of the elementary subgroup of $G(K)$ and the common normalizer of all its root subgroups.</description>
