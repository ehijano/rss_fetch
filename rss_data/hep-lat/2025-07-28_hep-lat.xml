      <title>Axial-vector molecular structures $B_{c}^{\ast \pm} B_{c}^{\mp}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axial-vector molecular structure $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}=(B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{-} + B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+})/2$ is explored in QCD sum rule framework. The mass and current coupling of this compound are found by means of the two-point sum rule method. It turns out that the mass of $\mathcal{M} _{\mathrm{AV}}$ is equal to $m=(12770 \pm 60)~\mathrm{MeV}$ making possible its dissociations to pairs of $J/\psi \eta_b$, $\Upsilon \eta_c$, $ B_{c}^{\ast +} B_{c}^{-}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+}$ mesons. The partial widths of these decay modes contain the strong couplings at $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$-meson-meson vertices which are calculated by utilizing the three-point sum rule method. The full decay width of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ is formed due to these dominant processes and amounts to $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}]=(93 \pm 14)~ \mathrm{MeV}$. Our results for parameters $m$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{AV}}]$ of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ are useful for experimental studies of various fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>

      <title>Structure of heavy quarkonia under strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural modifications of heavy quarkonia in the presence of strong magnetic fields using a constituent quark model. By incorporating the effects of spin mixing and quark Landau levels, we employ a nonrelativistic Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of quark dynamics in a magnetic field. The two-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved using the cylindrical Gaussian expansion method, which respects the cylindrical symmetry induced by a magnetic field. We extract the corresponding light-front wave function (LFWF) densities and analyze their transverse and longitudinal structures, revealing characteristic features such as transverse momentum broadening. While the longitudinal structure is only slightly modified within the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, we discuss some corrections that can significantly affect its longitudinal structure. Furthermore, we discuss the structure modifications of excited states and find notable changes in the LFWF densities, and state reshuffling near avoided crossings. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of hadron structure to external magnetic fields and help bridge our understanding to relativistic approaches.</description>

      <title>Quark models: What can they teach us?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark models have a more than 60-year history and through this time they served as a powerful investigation and prediction tool in hadronic physics. In recent years, a lot of new experimental information has been arriving on hadrons that do not qualify as simple quark model states. Yet, quark models remain the cornerstone of the classification scheme for hadrons, provide valuable insights into various phenomena inherent in QCD, and facilitate gaining a clear and physically transparent picture of the underlying physics. In the spotlight of this review is a chiral quark model inspired by quantum field theory approach to confined quarks. The model is well suited for studies of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the vacuum of QCD as well as its implications in the spectrum of hadrons. It can also be employed to investigate chiral restoration at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Eliminating leading and subleading corrections to scaling in the three-dimensional XY universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $(q+1)$-state clock model on the simple cubic lattice by using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition to the nearest neighbor coupling we consider a next-to-next-to-nearest neighbor coupling. For a certain range of the parameters, the phase transition of the model shares the XY universality class. Leading corrections to scaling are studied by using finite size scaling of dimensionless quantities, such as the Binder cumulant $U_4$. The spatial unisotropy, which causes subleading corrections, is studied by computing the exponential correlation length $\xi_{exp}$ in the high temperature phase for different directions. In the case of the $q$-state clock model it turns out that by tuning the ratio of the two coupling constants, we can eliminate either leading or subleading corrections to scaling. These points on the critical line are close to each other. Hence in the improved model, where leading corrections to scaling vanish, also subleading corrections are small. By using a finite size scaling analysis of our high statistics data we obtain $\eta=0.03816(2)$ and $y_t =1/\nu=1.48872(5)$ as estimates of the critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Long distance contributions to neutral $D$-meson mixing from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of neutral $D$-meson mixing provides a unique probe of long-distance effects in the charm sector, where Standard Model contributions are dominated by nonperturbative effects. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using spectral reconstruction techniques within lattice QCD to compute the long-distance contributions to $D^0- \bar{D}^0$ mixing. After outlining the general formalism describing neutral meson mixing in the charm sector, we focus on the determination of the mixing amplitudes and the dimensionless parameters $x = \Delta m_D / \Gamma_D$ and $y = \Delta \Gamma_D /(2 \Gamma_D)$, which respectively encode the mass and width differences between the $D$-meson mass eigenstates. We discuss in detail the required theoretical and computational framework, including the definition and renormalization of the four-quark operators entering the $\Delta C = 1$ weak Hamiltonian, and strategies for evaluating the relevant correlation functions employing variance-reduction techniques. To extract the mixing amplitudes, we explore methods for reconstructing the spectral density from lattice correlators, providing preliminary assessments of the data quality required to reach the scaling regime, where the smearing width is small enough to yield physically meaningful results. Our findings lay the groundwork for future precision determinations of long-distance contributions to $D$-meson mixing from first principles.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Unveils the Power Law of Finite-Volume Energy Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-volume extrapolation is an important step for extracting physical observables from lattice calculations. However, it is a significant challenge for the system with long-range interactions. We employ symbolic regression to regress finite-volume extrapolation formula for both short-range and long-range interactions. The regressed formula still holds the exponential form with a factor $L^n$ in front of it. The power decreases with the decreasing range of the force. When the range of the force becomes sufficiently small, the power converges to $-1$, recovering the short-range formula as expected. Our work represents a significant advancement in leveraging machine learning to probe uncharted territories within particle physics.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-six baryon-number-violating operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the second part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): the baryon-number-violating sector at dimension six in the power counting. We obtain the results in two different schemes: in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations; and in naive dimensional regularization, which in the considered sector of the theory does not lead to any ill-defined $\gamma_5$-odd traces. Our results are of interest for a reanalysis of the constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model from proton-decay searches within an EFT framework at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>
