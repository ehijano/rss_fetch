      <title>Asymptotic integrability of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of asymptotic integrability into the theory of nonlinear wave equations. It means that the Hamiltonian structure of equations describing propagation of high-frequency wave packets is preserved by hydrodynamic evolution of the large-scale background wave, so that these equations have an additional integral of motion. This condition is expressed mathematically as a system of equations for the carrier wave number as a function of the background variables. We show that a solution of this system for a given dispersion relation of linear waves is related with the quasiclassical limit of the Lax pair for the completely integrable equation having the corresponding dispersionless and linear dispersive behavior. We illustrate the theory by several examples.</description>

      <title>Progresses on some open problems related to infinitely many symmetries</title>

Abstract: The quest to reveal the physical essence of the infinitely many symmetries and conservation laws that are intrinsic to integrable systems has historically posed a significant challenge at the confluence of physics and mathematics. This scholarly investigation delves into five open problems related to these boundless symmetries within integrable systems by scrutinizing their multi-wave solutions, employing a fresh analytical methodology. For a specified integrable system, there exist various categories of $n$-wave solutions. Each sub-wave comprising the $n$-wave solution may possess free parameters, including center, width, and periodic parameters. It is evident that these solutions are translation invariant with respect to all these free parameters. We postulate that the entirety of the recognized infinite symmetries merely constitute linear combinations of these finite wave parameter translation symmetries. The conjecture intimates that the currently known infinitely many symmetries are not exhaustive, and an indeterminate number of symmetries remain to be discovered. This conjecture further indicates that by imposing an infinite array of symmetry constraints, it becomes feasible to derive exact multi-wave solutions. By considering the renowned KdV equation and the Burgers equation as simple examples, the conjecture is substantiated for the $n$-soliton solutions. It is unequivocal that any linear combination of the wave parameter translation symmetries retains its status as a symmetry associated with the particular solution. This observation suggests that by introducing a ren-variable and a ren-symmetric derivative which serve as generalizations of the Grassmann variable and the super derivative, it may be feasible to unify classical integrable systems, supersymmetric integrable systems, and ren-symmetric integrable systems within a cohesive hierarchical framework.</description>

      <title>Conformal duality of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation: Theory and applications to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is a rich and versatile model, which in one spatial dimension has stationary solutions similar to those of the linear Schr\"odinger equation as well as more exotic solutions such as solitary waves and quantum droplets. Here we present the unified theory of the NLSE, showing that all stationary solutions of the local one-dimensional cubic-quintic NLSE can be classified according to a single number called the cross-ratio. Any two solutions with the same cross-ratio can be converted into one another using a conformal transformation, and the same also holds true for traveling wave solutions. Further, we introduce an optimization afterburner that relies on this conformal symmetry to substantially improve NLSE parameter estimation from noisy empirical data. The new method therefore should have far reaching practical applications for nonlinear physical systems.</description>

      <title>Lie reductions and exact solutions of dispersionless Nizhnik equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhaustively classify the Lie reductions of the real dispersionless Nizhnik equation to partial differential equations in two independent variables and to ordinary differential equations. Lie and point symmetries of reduced equations are comprehensively studied, including the analysis of which of them correspond to hidden symmetries of the original equation. If necessary, associated Lie reductions of a nonlinear Lax representation of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation are carried out as well. As a result, we construct wide families of new invariant solutions of this equation in explicit form in terms of elementary, Lambert and hypergeometric functions as well as in parametric or implicit form. We show that Lie reductions to algebraic equations lead to no new solutions of this equation in addition to the constructed ones. Multiplicative separation of variables is used for illustrative construction of non-invariant solutions.</description>
