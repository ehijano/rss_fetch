      <title>A Simple Experimental System for Predicting the Temperature Rise of the Global Warming Induced by the Greenhouse Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, a simple experimental system is shown, by which the temperature rise of global warming due to greenhouse gases can be demonstrated quantitatively. The system configuration is similar to that of the earth-atmosphere-space system based on a simple gray atmosphere model. The space (heat sink), the ground surface and the radiation power from the sun were replaced by a liquid nitrogen, and a black coated aluminum plated with an electric heater and an electric power of the heater, respectively. We believe that it can be a unique experimental system, that is useful for the study of the greenhouse effect in a laboratory, as well as for the educational demonstration tool of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Identifying Key Drivers of Heatwaves: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Framework for Extreme Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heatwaves (HWs) are extreme atmospheric events that produce significant societal and environmental impacts. Predicting these extreme events remains challenging, as their complex interactions with large-scale atmospheric and climatic variables are difficult to capture with traditional statistical and dynamical models. This work presents a general method for driver identification in extreme climate events. A novel framework (STCO-FS) is proposed to identify key immediate (short-term) HW drivers by combining clustering algorithms with an ensemble evolutionary algorithm. The framework analyzes spatio-temporal data, reduces dimensionality by grouping similar geographical nodes for each variable, and develops driver selection in spatial and temporal domains, identifying the best time lags between predictive variables and HW occurrences. The proposed method has been applied to analyze HWs in the Adda river basin in Italy. The approach effectively identifies significant variables influencing HWs in this region. This research can potentially enhance our understanding of HW drivers and predictability.</description>

      <title>DaYu: Data-Driven Model for Geostationary Satellite Observed Cloud Images Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based weather forecasting methods have widely demonstrated strong competitiveness among the weather forecasting systems. However, these methods are insufficient for high-spatial-resolution short-term nowcasting within 6 hours, which is crucial for warning short-duration, mesoscale and small-scale weather events. Geostationary satellite remote sensing provides detailed, high spatio-temporal and all-day observations, which can address the above limitations of existing methods. Therefore, this paper proposed an advanced data-driven thermal infrared cloud images forecasting model, "DaYu." Unlike existing data-driven weather forecasting models, DaYu is specifically designed for geostationary satellite observations, with a temporal resolution of 0.5 hours and a spatial resolution of ${0.05}^\circ$ $\times$ ${0.05}^\circ$. DaYu is based on a large-scale transformer architecture, which enables it to capture fine-grained cloud structures and learn fast-changing spatio-temporal evolution features effectively. Moreover, its attention mechanism design achieves a balance in computational complexity, making it practical for applications. DaYu not only achieves accurate forecasts up to 3 hours with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.9, 6 hours higher than 0.8, and 12 hours higher than 0.7, but also detects short-duration, mesoscale, and small-scale weather events with enhanced detail, effectively addressing the shortcomings of existing methods in providing detailed short-term nowcasting within 6 hours. Furthermore, DaYu has significant potential in short-term climate disaster prevention and mitigation.</description>

      <title>On the solutions of a factorized wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-distance transmission of energy by waves is a key mechanism for many natural processes. It becomes possible when the inhomogeneous medium is arranged in such a manner that it enables a specific type of waves to propagate with virtually no reflection or scattering. If the corresponding wave equation admits factorization, at least one of the waves it describes propagates without reflection. The paper is devoted to searching for conditions under which both solutions of a one-dimensional factorized wave equation of the second order describe traveling waves, that is, waves propagating without reflection. Possible variants of wave structure are found and the results are compared with those obtained in previous studies.</description>

      <title>FengWu-W2S: A deep learning model for seamless weather-to-subseasonal forecast of global atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seamless forecasting that produces warning information at continuum timescales based on only one system is a long-standing pursuit for weather-climate service. While the rapid advancement of deep learning has induced revolutionary changes in classical forecasting field, current efforts are still focused on building separate AI models for weather and climate forecasts. To explore the seamless forecasting ability based on one AI model, we propose FengWu-Weather to Subseasonal (FengWu-W2S), which builds on the FengWu global weather forecast model and incorporates an ocean-atmosphere-land coupling structure along with a diverse perturbation strategy. FengWu-W2S can generate 6-hourly atmosphere forecasts extending up to 42 days through an autoregressive and seamless manner. Our hindcast results demonstrate that FengWu-W2S reliably predicts atmospheric conditions out to 3-6 weeks ahead, enhancing predictive capabilities for global surface air temperature, precipitation, geopotential height and intraseasonal signals such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Moreover, our ablation experiments on forecast error growth from daily to seasonal timescales reveal potential pathways for developing AI-based integrated system for seamless weather-climate forecasting in the future.</description>

      <title>Long-window hybrid variational data assimilation methods for chaotic climate models tested with the Lorenz 63 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid 4D-variational data assimilation method for chaotic climate models is introduced using the Lorenz '63 model. This approach aims to optimise an Earth system model (ESM), for which no adjoint exists, by utilising an adjoint model of a different, potentially simpler ESM. The technique relies on synchronisation of the model to observed time series data employing the dynamical state and parameter estimation (DSPE) method to stabilise the tangent linear system by reducing all positive Lyapunov exponents to negative values. Therefore, long windows can be used to improve parameter estimation. In this new extension a second layer of synchronisation is added between the two models, with and without an adjoint, to facilitate linearisation around the trajectory of the model without an adjoint. The method is conceptually demonstrated by synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems, representing two ESMs, one with and the other without an adjoint model. Results are presented for an idealised case of identical, perfect models and for a more realistic case in which they differ from one another. If employed with a coarser ESM with an adjoint, the method will save computational power as only one forward run with the full ESM per iteration needs to be carried out. It is demonstrated that there is negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the 'traditional' optimisation of full ESM with an adjoint. In a variation of the method outlined, synchronisation between two identical models can be used to filter noisy data. This reduces optimised parametric model uncertainty by approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and structure-preservation in summation by parts methods for the moist compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moist thermodynamics is a fundamental driver of atmospheric dynamics across all scales, making accurate modeling of these processes essential for reliable weather forecasts and climate change projections. However, atmospheric models often make a variety of inconsistent approximations in representing moist thermodynamics. These inconsistencies can introduce spurious sources and sinks of energy, potentially compromising the integrity of the models.
  Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent and structure preserving formulation of the moist compressible Euler equations. When discretised with a summation by parts method, our spatial discretisation conserves: mass, water, entropy, and energy. These properties are achieved by discretising a skew symmetric form of the moist compressible Euler equations, using entropy as a prognostic variable, and the summation-by-parts property of discrete derivative operators. Additionally, we derive a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method with energy and tracer variance stable numerical fluxes, and experimentally verify our theoretical results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A note on an inversion algorithm for vertical ionograms for the prediction of plasma frequency profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the concept of utilizing quasi-parabolic approximations to determine plasma frequency profiles from ionograms, we present a refined multi-quasi-parabolic method for modeling the E and F layers. While a recent study AIP Advances 14 065034 introduced an approach in this direction, we identified several inaccuracies in its mathematical treatment and numerical results. By addressing these issues, we offer a clearer exposition and a more robust algorithm. Our method assumes a parabolic profile for the E layer and approximates the F layer with a series of concatenated quasi-parabolic segments, ensuring continuity and smoothness by matching derivatives at the junctions. Applied to daylight ionograms from the Jicamarca Observatory in Lima, our inversion algorithm demonstrates excellent agreement between the synthetic ionograms generated from our predicted plasma frequency profiles and the original measured data.</description>
