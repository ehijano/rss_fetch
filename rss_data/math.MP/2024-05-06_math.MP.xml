      <title>On finite-dimensional smoothed-particle Hamiltonian reductions of the Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusion of spatial smoothing in finite-dimensional particle-based Hamiltonian reductions of the Vlasov equation are considered. In the context of the Vlasov-Poisson equation (and other mean-field Lie-Poisson systems), smoothing amounts to a convolutive regularization of the Hamiltonian. This regularization may be interpreted as a change of the inner product structure used to identify the dual space in the Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian formulation. In particular, the shape function used for spatial smoothing may be identified as the kernel function of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space whose inner product is used to define the Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structure. It is likewise possible to introduce smoothing in the Vlasov-Maxwell system, but in this case the Poisson bracket must be modified rather than the Hamiltonian. The smoothing applied to the Vlasov-Maxwell system is incorporated by inserting smoothing in the map from canonical to kinematic coordinates. In the filtered system, the Lorentz force law and the current, the two terms coupling the Vlasov equation with Maxwell's equations, are spatially smoothed.</description>

      <title>Deformation maps of quasi-twilled Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a unified approach to study the cohomology theories and deformation theories of various types of operators in the category of Lie algebras, including modified $r$-matrices, crossed homomorphisms, derivations, homomorphisms, relative Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators and deformation maps of matched pairs of Lie algebras. The main ingredients are quasi-twilled Lie algebras. We introduce two types of deformation maps of a quasi-twilled Lie algebra. Deformation maps of type I unify modified $r$-matrices, crossed homomorphisms, derivations and homomorphisms between Lie algebras, while deformation maps of type II unify relative Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators and deformation maps of matched pairs of Lie algebras. We further give the controlling algebras and cohomologies of these two types of deformation maps, which not only recover the existing results for crossed homomorphisms, derivations, homomorphisms, relative Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds operators, but also leads to some new results which are unable to solve before, e.g. the controlling algebras and cohomologies of modified $r$-matrices and deformation maps of matched pairs of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping cascaded random matrix models: correlations in permutations of matrix products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random matrix theory is a useful tool in the study of the physics of multiple scattering systems, often striking a balance between computation speed and physical rigour. Propagation of waves through thick disordered media, as arises in for example optical scattering or electron transport, typically necessitates cascading of multiple random matrices drawn from an underlying ensemble for thin media, greatly increasing computational burden. Here we propose a dual pool based bootstrapping approach to speed up statistical studies of scattering in thick random media. We examine how potential matrix reuse in a pool based approach can impact statistical estimates of population averages. Specifically, we discuss how both bias and additional variance in the sample mean estimator are introduced through bootstrapping. In the diffusive scattering regime, the extra estimator variance is shown to originate from samples in which cascaded transfer matrices are permuted matrix products. Through analysis of the combinatorics and cycle structure of permutations we quantify the resulting correlations. Proofs of several analytic formulae enumerating the frequency with which correlations of different strengths occur are derived. Extension to the ballistic regime is briefly considered.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Odzijewicz, Berezin and Fedosov-type quantizations on smooth compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we define Odzijewicz, Berezin and Fedosov-type quantization on compact smooth manifolds. The method is as follows. We embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ (and in the Fedosov quantization case embed into any real $2n$ dimensional symplectic manifold). The pullback coherent states are defined in the usual way. In the Odzijewicz-type, Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of geometric quantization is the pullback by the embedding of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Kohinoor Ghosh (where we had needed totally real embedding). The Fedosov-type quantization is carried out by restriction to the submanifold given by the embedding.</description>

      <title>Rigged Hilbert Space formulation for quasi-Hermitian composite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discussion in this study delves into Dirac's bra-ket formalism for a quasi-Hermitian quantum composite system based on the rigged Hilbert space (RHS). We establish an RHS with a positive definite metric suitable for a quasi-Hermite composite system. The obtained RHS is utilized to construct the bra and ket vectors for the non-Hermite composite system and produce the spectral decomposition of the quasi-Hermitian operator. We show that the symmetric relations regarding quasi-Hermitian operators can be extended to dual spaces, and all descriptions obtained using the bra-ket formalism are completely developed in the dual spaces. Our methodology is applied to a non-Hermitian harmonic oscillator composed of conformal multi-dimensional many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Photonic Structures with Broken Reflection Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical theory for Dirac points and interface modes in honeycomb topological photonic structures consisting of impenetrable obstacles. Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining $120^\circ$-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the boundary integral equation method to show the existence of Dirac points for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone. We then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with Dirac points differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the Dirac points and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the quantum valley Hall effect in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay exponentially away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the zigzag interface, the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces. Using the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.</description>

      <title>The Ising Model Coupled to 2D Gravity: Genus Zero Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the genus $0$ free energy for the $2$-matrix model with quartic interactions, which acts as a generating function for the Ising model's partition function on a random, $4$-regular, planar graph. This rigorously confirms the predictions of V.A. Kazakov and D.V. Boulatov on this model, and provides a new parametric formula for the free energy. We also give a characterization of the phase space of the model. Our analysis is based on a steepest descent Riemann-Hilbert analysis of the associated biorthogonal polynomials and the corresponding isomonodromic $\tau$-function. A key ingredient in the analysis is a parametrization of the spectral curve.</description>

      <title>The Ising Model Coupled to 2D Gravity: Higher-order Painlev\'{e} Equations/The $(3,4)$ String Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuation of the work [1], we study a higher-order Painlev\'{e}-type equation, arising as a string equation of the $3^{rd}$ order reduction of the KP hierarchy. This equation appears at the multi-critical point of the $2$-matrix model with quartic interactions, and describes the Ising phase transition coupled to 2D gravity. We characterize this equation in terms of the isomonodromic deformations of a particular rational connection on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. We also identify the (nonautonomous) Hamiltonian structure associated to this equation, and write a suitable $\tau$-differential for this system. This $\tau$-differential can be extended to the canonical coordinates of the associated Hamiltonian system, allowing us to verify Conjectures 1. and 2. of [2] in our case. We also present a fairly general formula for the $\tau$-differential of a special class of resonant connections, which is somewhat simpler than that of [3].

      <title>Upper Bound for the Free Energy of Dilute Bose Gases at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Bose gas at density $\rho &gt; 0$, interacting through a repulsive potential $V \in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^3)$ with scattering length $\mathfrak{a} &gt; 0$. We prove an upper bound for the free energy of the system, valid at low temperature $T \lesssim \rho \mathfrak{a}$. Combined with the recent lower bound obtained in \cite{HabHaiNamSeiTri-23}, our estimate resolves the free energy per unit volume up to and including the Lee--Huang--Yang order $\mathfrak{a} \rho^2 (\rho \mathfrak{a}^3)^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>On Wave-Like Differential Equations in General Hilbert Space. The Functional Analytic Investigation of Euler-Bernoulli Bending Vibrations of a Beam as an Application in Engineering Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-like partial differential equations occur in many engineering applications. Here the engineering setup is embedded into the Hilbert space framework of functional analysis of modern mathematical physics. The notion wave-like is a generalization of the primary wave (partial) differential equation.
  A short overview over three wave-like problems in physics and engineering is presented. The mathematical procedure for achieving positive, selfadjoint differential operators in an $\mathrm{L}^2$-Hilbert space is described, operators which then may be taken for wave-like differential equations. Also some general results from the functional analytic literature are summarized.
  The main part concerns the investigation of the free Euler--Bernoulli bending vibrations of a slender, straight, elastic beam in one spatial dimension in the $\mathrm{L}^2$-Hilbert space setup. Taking suitable Sobolev spaces we perform the mathematically exact introduction and analysis of the corresponding (spatial) positive, selfadjoint differential operators of $4$-th order, which belong to the different boundary conditions arising as supports in statics. A comparison with free wave swinging of a string is added, using a Laplacian as differential operator.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop a systematic reduction procedure for determining intermediate integrals of second order hyperbolic equations so that exact solutions of the second order PDEs under interest can be obtained by solving first order PDEs. We give some conditions in order that such a procedure holds and, in particular, we characterize classes of linear second order hyperbolic equations for which the general solution can be found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a unital completely positive map on the space of operators on some Hilbert space. We assume that $\Phi$ is almost idempotent, namely, $\|\Phi^2-\Phi\|_{\mathrm{cb}} \le\eta$, and construct a corresponding "$\varepsilon$-$C^*$ algebra" for $\varepsilon=O(\eta)$. This type of structure has the axioms of a unital $C^*$ algebra but the associativity and other axioms involving the multiplication and the unit hold up to $\varepsilon$. We further prove that any finite-dimensional $\varepsilon$-$C^*$ algebra is $O(\varepsilon)$-isomorphic to a genuine $C^*$ algebra. These bounds are universal, i.e.\ do not depend on the dimensionality or other parameters.</description>

      <title>From quantum difference equation to Dubrovin connection of affine type A quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the continuation of the article \cite{Z23}. In this article we will give a detailed analysis of the quantum difference equation of the equivariant $K$-theory of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties. We will give a good representation of the quantum difference operator $\mathbf{M}_{\mathcal{L}}(z)$ such that the monodromy operator $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}(z)$in the formula can be written in the $U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-form or in the $U_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_1)$-form. We also give the detailed analysis of the connection matrix for the quantum difference equation in the nodal limit $p\rightarrow0$. Using these two results, we prove that the degeneration limit of the quantum difference equation is the Dubrovin connection for the quantum cohomology of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties, and the monodromy representation for the Dubrovin connection is generated by the monodromy operators $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations for multiple scattering in one-dimensional waveguides with small inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model to approximate the wave response of waveguides containing an arbitrary number of small inclusions. The theory is developed to consider any one-dimensional waveguide (longitudinal, flexural, shear, torsional waves or a combination of them by mechanical coupling), containing small inclusions with different material and/or sectional properties. The exact problem is modelled through the formalism of generalised functions, with the Heaviside function accounting for the discontinuous jump in different sectional properties of the inclusions. For asymptotically small inclusions, the exact solution is shown to be equivalent to the Green's function. We hypothesize that these expressions are also valid when the size of the inclusions are small in comparison to the wavelength, allowing us to approximate small inhomogeneities as regular perturbations to the empty-waveguide (the homogeneous waveguide in the absence of scatterers) as point source terms. By approximating solutions through the Green's function, the multiple scattering problem is considerably simplified, allowing us to develop a general methodology in which the solution is expressed for any model for any elastic waveguide. The advantage of our approach is that, by expressing the constitutive equations in first order form as a matrix, the solutions can be expressed in matrix form; therefore, it is trivial to consider models with more degrees of freedom and to arrive at solutions to multiple scattering problems independent of the elastic model used. The theory is validated with two numerical examples, where we perform an error analysis to demonstrate the validity of the approximate solutions, and we propose a parameter quantifying the expected errors in the approximation dependent upon the parameters of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>On finding bifurcations for non-variational elliptic systems by the extended quotients method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel method for finding bifurcations for nonlinear systems of equations based on directly finding bifurcations through saddle points of extended quotients. The method is applied to find the saddle-node bifurcation point for elliptic equations with the nonlinearity of the general convex-concave type. The main result justifies the variational formula for the detection of the maximum saddle-node type bifurcation point of stable positive solutions. As a consequence, a precise threshold value separating the interval of the existence of stable positive solutions is established.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1730, Euler defined the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ by the integral representation. It possesses many interesting properties and has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and sciences. According to Lerch, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ can also be defined by the derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{z}}$$ at $z=0$. Recently, Hu and Kim defined the corresponding Stieltjes constants $\widetilde{\gamma}_{k}(x)$ and Euler constant $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ from the Taylor series of the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ $$\zeta_{E}(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^z}.$$ And they also introduced the corresponding Gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ which has the following Weierstrass--Hadamard type product $$\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)=\frac{1}{x}e^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}x}\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{k}}\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right)^{(-1)^{k+1}}.$$
  In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication formula and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$. As an application to Stark's conjecture in algebraic number theory, we will explicit calculate the derivatives of the partial zeta functions for the maximal real subfield of cyclotomic fields at $z=0$.</description>

Abstract: A certain two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory is argued to satisfy a relation that promotes the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation to an infrared duality between two quantum field theories. Solutions of the tetrahedron equation with continuous spin variables are obtained from partition functions of this theory and its variants.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a model for the behavior of Dirac particles under the tensor effect in the spherical core/shell regime. We examine the change of energy levels corresponding to the particles localized in a space of approximately 1.0 fm in the core region of the quantum sphere, with the well width. It also occurs from the analytical solutions that the two different levels accompany particle states of the same mass. Additionally, the solutions exhibiting anomalous behavior, giving rise to antiparticle-type states, occur at heavier mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we successfully identify a cosmological sector for General Relativity in Ashtekar variables, which preserves the SU(2) structure of the theory and the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry. Additionally, we proceed to quantize it using the machinery of Loop Quantum Gravity, uncovering that the resulting spin-network states exhibit distinctive symmetry properties and encompass the usual states of Loop Quantum Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of vortex memory system driven by edge-current and boundary magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a magnetohydrodynamic model is developed to study the dynamics of vortices driven by edge-current. Two modeled equations for fluid and magnetic field variables are each transformed into diffusion equation for vorticity and poisson equation for stream function. A numerical solution method is designed using a simplified Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM-D2Q5 scheme is utilized to obtain the numerical solutions for the fluid and magnetic field variables. Understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of systems employed in vortex-based memory systems is crucial for reliability and performance optimization. Based on this motivation, the effect of applied edge-current on the hydrodynamic and magnetic vortex configurations are analyzed through numerical simulations. The impact of the boundary magnetization is also conducted, by varying the strength of the magnetic field at the bottom boundary. The obtained graphical results provide some insights into the design and operation of vortex-based memory systems for next-generation data storage applications.</description>

      <title>Loss Jump During Loss Switch in Solving PDEs with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) is gaining popularity as an alternative approach in the scientific computing community. Neural networks can integrate different types of information into the loss function. These include observation data, governing equations, and variational forms, etc. These loss functions can be broadly categorized into two types: observation data loss directly constrains and measures the model output, while other loss functions indirectly model the performance of the network, which can be classified as model loss. However, this alternative approach lacks a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms, including theoretical foundations and rigorous characterization of various phenomena. This work focuses on investigating how different loss functions impact the training of neural networks for solving PDEs. We discover a stable loss-jump phenomenon: when switching the loss function from the data loss to the model loss, which includes different orders of derivative information, the neural network solution significantly deviates from the exact solution immediately. Further experiments reveal that this phenomenon arises from the different frequency preferences of neural networks under different loss functions. We theoretically analyze the frequency preference of neural networks under model loss. This loss-jump phenomenon provides a valuable perspective for examining the underlying mechanisms of neural networks in solving PDEs.</description>

      <title>Solutions to ${\rm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system with cone singularities via toric curves on compact Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a compact Riemann surface (X) with finite punctures (P_1, \ldots, P_k), we define toric curves as multi-valued, totally unramified holomorphic maps to (\mathbb{P}^n) with monodromy in a maximal torus of ({\rm PSU}(n+1)). \textit{Toric solutions} for the ({\rm SU}(n+1)) system on $X\setminus\{P_1,\ldots, P_k\}$ are recognized by their associated {\it toric} curves in (\mathbb{P}^n). We introduce a character n-ensemble as an (n)-tuple of meromorphic one-forms with simple poles and purely imaginary periods, generating toric curves on (X) minus finitely many points. We establish on $X$ a correspondence between character $n$-ensembles and toric solutions to the ({\rm SU}(n+1)) system with finitely many cone singularities. Our approach not only broadens seminal solutions for up to two cone singularities on the Riemann sphere, as classified by Jost-Wang (Int. Math. Res. Not., (6):277-290, 2002) and Lin-Wei-Ye (Invent. Math., 190(1):169-207, 2012), but also advances beyond the limits of Lin-Yang-Zhong's existence theorems (J. Differential Geom., 114(2):337-391, 2020) by introducing a new solution class.</description>

      <title>Delayed Electron-Ion Entanglement Revealed with Zero Area Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when the remaining ion is dressed by a field. As was recently shown, the doublet can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement between photoelectrons and strongly coupled ions. However, the dressed state nature of the ion prevents detection of the entanglement by straightforward coincidence detection. Here, we find that odd (zero-area) envelopes can substantially delay the generation of entanglement, but also modify the dynamics such that the doublet transforms into unique channel-resolved photoelectron distributions. Because these distributions can be used to correlate with the internal state of the ion, our proposed scheme opens up for detection of quantum entanglement, between photoelectrons and stongly-coupled ions, without a need for quantum phase measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel phase transition from stable to unstable fluid behaviour for fluid-filled cosmological spacetimes undergoing decelerated expansion. This transition occurs when the fluid speed of sound $c_S$ exceeds a critical value relative to the expansion rate $a(t) = t^\alpha$ of spacetime. We present an explicit relationship between $\alpha$ and $c_S$ , which subdivides the $(\alpha,c_S)$-parameter space into two regions. Using rigorous techniques, we establish stability of quiet fluid solutions in the first stable region. Numerical experiments reveal that the complement of the stable region consists of unstable solutions, implying sharpness of our stability result. We provide a definitive analytical bound and high-precision numerical evidence for the exact location of the critical line separating the stable from the unstable region.</description>

      <title>Emergence of condensation patterns in kinetic equations for opinion dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we define a class of models to understand the impact of population size on opinion formation dynamics, a phenomenon usually related to group conformity. To this end, we introduce a new kinetic model in which the interaction frequency is weighted by the kinetic density. In the quasi-invariant regime, this model reduces to a Kaniadakis-Quarati-type equation with nonlinear drift, originally introduced for the dynamics of bosons in a spatially homogeneous setting. From the obtained PDE for the evolution of the opinion density, we determine the regime of parameters for which a critical mass exists and triggers blow-up of the solution. Therefore, the model is capable of describing strong conformity phenomena in cases where the total density of individuals holding a given opinion exceeds a fixed critical size. In the final part, several numerical experiments demonstrate the features of the introduced class of models and the related consensus effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that suitable transport noises produce anomalous dissipation of energy of solutions to the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and diffusion equations in all dimensions. The key ingredients are Meyers' type estimates for SPDEs with transport noise which are combined with recent scaling limits for such SPDEs. The former allow us to obtain, for the first time for such type of scaling limits, convergence in a space of positive smoothness uniformly in time. Compared to known results, one of the main novelties is that anomalous dissipation might take place even in presence of a transport noise of arbitrarily small intensity. Further, we discuss physical interpretations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of the phase-space structures of KCN molecular system as a function of the vibrational energy using Lagrangian descriptors. For low energies, the motion is mostly regular around the absolute minimum of the potential energy surface. As the energy increases, the phase space combines regions with regular and chaotic motion, a difference that is well captured by the Lagrangian descriptors. We show that the dynamics is mostly governed by the invariant manifolds of the stretch periodic orbits located at the top of one of the energetic barriers of the system. Furthermore, we show a perfect agreement between the bifurcation theory and the differences observed in the phase-space structures as the vibrational energy is modified. The accuracy of our calculations is also assessed by explicit comparison with the invariant manifolds computed using linear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Existence of Schrodinger Evolution with Absorbing Boundary Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.12057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function inside a region $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and suppose that detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. The question how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which the detector surface registers the particle boils down to finding a reasonable mathematical definition of an ideal detecting surface; a particularly convincing definition, called the absorbing boundary rule, involves a time evolution for the particle's wave function $\psi$ expressed by a Schrodinger equation in $\Omega$ together with an "absorbing" boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ first considered by Werner in 1987, viz., $\partial \psi/\partial n=i\kappa\psi$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ and $\partial/\partial n$ the normal derivative. We provide here a discussion of the rigorous mathematical foundation of this rule. First, for the viability of the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely define the time evolution of $\psi$; we point out here how the Hille-Yosida theorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a contraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the $N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. Finally, we also prove analogous results for the Dirac equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

Abstract: The one-loop quantum corrections to the internal energy of some lattices due to the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field of phonons are studied. The band spectrum of the lattice is characterised in terms of the scattering data, allowing to compute the quantum vacuum interaction energy between nodes at zero temperature, as well as the total Helmholtz free energy, the entropy, and the Casimir pressure between nodes at finite non-zero temperature. Some examples of periodic potentials built from the repetition in one of the three spatial dimensions of the same punctual or compact supported potential are addressed: a stack of parallel plates constructed by positioning $\delta\delta'$-functions at the lattice nodes, and an 'upside-down tiled roof' of parallel two-dimensional P\"oschl-Teller wells centred at the nodes. They will be called generalised Dirac comb and P\"oschl-Teller comb, respectively. Positive one-loop quantum corrections to the entropy appear for both combs at non-zero temperatures. Moreover, the Casimir force between the lattice nodes is always repulsive for both chains when non-trivial temperatures are considered, implying that the primitive cell increases its size due to the quantum interaction of the phonon field.</description>

      <title>On the spin interface distribution for non-integrable variants of the two-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a martingale observable related to the spin interface for a class of non-integrable variants of the two-dimensional Ising model and express it in terms of Grassmann integrals. Under a conjecture about the scaling limit of this object, which is similar to some results recently obtained using constructive renormalization group methods, this would imply that the distribution of the interface at criticality has the same scaling limit as in the integrable model: Schramm-Loewner evolution SLE(3).</description>

      <title>Energy cascade for the Klein-Gordon lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional Klein-Gordon lattice with periodic boundary conditions, for $d \leq 3$. We consider initial data supported on one low-frequency Fourier mode. We show that, in the continuous approximation, the resonant normal form of the system is given by a small-dispersion nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. By exploiting a result about the growth of Sobolev norms for solutions of small-dispersion NLS, we are able to describe an energy cascade phenomenon for the Klein-Gordon lattice, where part of the energy is transferred to modes associated to higher frequencies. Such phenomenon holds within the time-scale for which we can ensure the validity of the continuous approximation.</description>

      <title>Horizon fluxes of binary black holes in eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03771v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, namely tidal heating, in an eccentric orbit. The change is caused due to the tidal field of the orbiting companion. We compute the result for both the spinning and non-spinning black holes in the leading order of the mean motion, namely $\xi$. We demonstrate that the rates get enhanced significantly for nonzero eccentricity. Since eccentricity in a binary evolves with time we also express the results in terms of an initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency $\xi_{\phi}$. In the process, we developed a prescription that can be used to compute all physical quantities in a series expansion of initial eccentricity, $e_0$. These results are computed taking account of the spin of the binary components. The prescription can be used to compute very high-order corrections of initial eccentricity. We use it to find the contribution to eccentricity up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$ in the spinning binary. We also provide an approximate expression for $\mathcal{O}(e_0^n)$, where $n$ is any odd number. With this, we compute approximate expression for $\mathcal{O}(e_0^7)$ and $\mathcal{O}(e_0^9)$ for non-spinning binary. Using the computed expression of eccentricity, we derived the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, both rotating and non-rotating, in terms of initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^6)$. We also compute leading order dephasing in both cases analytically up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^6)$ and study its impact.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Deconfinement Transition for Potts Lattice Gauge Theory in Codimension Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Aizenman, Chayes, Chayes, Fr\"ohlich, and Russo proved that $2$-dimensional Bernoulli plaquette percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^3$ exhibits a sharp phase transition for the event that a large rectangular loop is "bounded by a surface of plaquettes.'' We extend this result both to $(d-1)$-dimensional plaquette percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^d,$ and to a dependent model of plaquette percolation called the plaquette random-cluster model. As a consequence, we obtain a sharp phase transition for Wilson loop expectations in $(d-2)$-dimensional $q$-state Potts hyperlattice gauge theory on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ dual to that of the Potts model. Our proof is unconditional for Ising lattice gauge theory, but relies on a regularity conjecture for the random-cluster model in slabs when $q&gt;2.$ We also further develop the general theory of the $i$-plaquette random cluster model and its relationship with $(i-1)$-dimensional Potts lattice gauge</description>

      <title>Absorbing boundary conditions for the Helmholtz equation using Gauss-Legendre quadrature reduced integrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) for the Helmholtz equation. The proposed ABCs are obtained by using $L$ discrete layers and the $Q_N$ Lagrange finite element in conjunction with the $N$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature reduced integration rule in a specific formulation of perfectly matched layers. The proposed ABCs are classified by a tuple $(L,N)$, and achieve reflection error of order $O(R^{2LN})$ for some $R&lt;1$. The new ABCs generalise the perfectly matched discrete layers proposed by Guddati and Lim [Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 66 (6) (2006) 949-977], including them as type $(L,1)$. An analysis of the proposed ABCs is performed motivated by the work of Ainsworth [J. Comput. Phys. 198 (1) (2004) 106-130]. The new ABCs facilitate numerical implementations of the Helmholtz problem with ABCs if $Q_N$ finite elements are used in the physical domain as well as give more insight into this field for the further advancement.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples and weak (1,1) estimates of wave operators for fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to investigating the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ associated with fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^2+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$. We consider that real potentials satisfy $|V(x)|\lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-\mu}$ for some $\mu&gt;0$. A recent work by Goldberg and Green \cite{GoGr21} has demonstrated that wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ under the condition that $\mu&gt;9$, and zero is a regular point of $H$. In this paper, we aim to further establish endpoint estimates for $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ in two significant ways. First, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the unboundedness of $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ on the endpoint spaces $L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ and $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$, even for non-zero compactly supported potentials $V$. Second, we establish weak (1,1) estimates for the wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ and their dual operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)^*$ in the case where zero is a regular point and $\mu&gt;11$. These estimates depend critically on the singular integral theory of Calder\'on-Zygmund on a homogeneous space $(X,d\omega)$ with a doubling measure $d\omega$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a density one version of Braak's conjecture on the fine structure of the spectrum of the quantum Rabi model, as well as a recent conjecture of Braak, Nguyen, Reyes-Bustos and Wakayama on the nearest neighbor spacings of the spectrum. The proof uses a three-term asymptotic expansion for large eigenvalues due to Boutet de Monvel and Zielinski, and a number theoretic argument from uniform distribution theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cellular automaton is a widely known model of both reversible and irreversible computations. The family of reversible second-order cellular automata considered in this work is appropriate both for construction of logic gates and analysis of damage distribution. The quantities such as formal dimension of damage patterns can be used only for rough estimation of consequences of particular faults and numerical experiments are provided for illustration of some subtleties. Such analysis demonstrates high sensitivity to errors from defects, lack of synchronization and too short intervals between signals.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of invariant differential operators on the example of the non-compact algebras $sp(n,1)$. Our choice of these algebras is motivated by the fact that they belong to a narrow class of algebras, which are of split rank one, of which class the other cases were studied, some long time ago. We concentrate on the case $n=2$. We give the main multiplets and the main reduced multiplets of indecomposable elementary representations for, including the necessary data for all relevant invariant differential operators. We also present explicit expressions for the singular vectors and for the intertwining differential operators.</description>

      <title>Quantum convolutional channels and multiparameter families of 2-unitary matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many alternative approaches to construct quantum channels with large entangling capacities were proposed in the past decade, resulting in multiple isolated gates. In this work, we put forward a novel one, inspired by convolution, which provides greater freedom of nonlocal parameters. Although quantum counterparts of convolution have been shown not to exist for pure states, several attempts with various degrees of rigorousness have been proposed for mixed states. In this work, we follow the approach based on coherifications of multi-stochastic operations and demonstrate a surprising connection to gates with high entangling power. In particular, we identify conditions necessary for the convolutional channels constructed using our method to possess maximal entangling power. Furthermore, we establish new, continuous classes of bipartite 2-unitary matrices of dimension $d^2$ for $d = 7$ and $d = 9$, with $2$ and $4$ free nonlocal parameters beyond simple phasing of matrix elements, corresponding to perfect tensors of rank $4$ or 4-partite absolutely maximally entangled states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a globally hyperbolic spacetime containing a trapped surface and satisfying the strong energy condition and a condition on certain radial tidal forces must be timelike geodesically incomplete. This constitutes a "timelike" version of Penrose's celebrated singularity theorem. Recall that the latter concludes that certain spacetimes are null incomplete, providing the first theoretical evidence that black holes actually exist in our Universe. By concluding timelike instead of null incompleteness, we obtain, at the expense of stronger assumptions, a clearer physical interpretation and the existence of an event horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional differential calculus is a mathematical tool that has found applications in the study of social and physical behaviors considered ``anomalous''. It is often used when traditional integer derivatives models fail to represent cases where the power law is observed accurately. Fractional calculus must reflect non-local, frequency- and history-dependent properties of power-law phenomena. This tool has various important applications, such as fractional mass conservation, electrochemical analysis, groundwater flow problems, and fractional spatiotemporal diffusion equations. It can also be used in cosmology to explain late-time cosmic acceleration without the need for dark energy. We review some models using fractional differential equations. We look at the Einstein--Hilbert action, which is based on a fractional derivative action, and add a scalar field, $\phi$, to create a non-minimal interaction theory with the coupling, $\xi R \phi^2 $, between gravity and the scalar field, where $\xi$ is the interaction constant. By employing various mathematical approaches, we can offer precise schemes to find analytical and numerical approximations of the solutions. Moreover, we comprehensively study the modified cosmological equations and analyze the solution space using the theory of dynamical systems and asymptotic expansion methods. This enables us to provide a qualitative description of cosmologies with a scalar field based on fractional calculus formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare a relativistic and a nonrelativistic version of Ostrogradsky's method for higher-time derivative theories extended to scalar field theories and consider as an alternative a multi-field variant. We apply the schemes to space-time rotated modified Korteweg-de Vries systems and, exploiting their integrability, to Hamiltonian systems built from space-time rotated inverse Legendre transformed higher-order charges of these systems. We derive the equal-time Poisson bracket structures of these theories, establish the integrability of the latter theories by means of the Painlev\'e test and construct exact analytical period benign solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions to the classical equations of motion. The classical energies of these partially complex solutions are real when they respect a certain modified CPT-symmetry and complex when this symmetry is broken. The higher order Cauchy and initial-boundary value problem are addressed analytically and numerically. Finally, we provide the explicit quantization of the simplest mKdV system, exhibiting the usual conundrum of having the choice between either having to deal with a theory that includes non-normalizable states or spectra that are unbounded from below. In our non-Hermitian system the choice is dictated by the correct sign in the decay width.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the confluent hypergeometric process with a varying external potential in the super-exponential region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a determinantal point process on the interval $(-s,s)$, associated with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Let $\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ denote the trace class integral operator acting on $L^2(-s, s)$ with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Our focus is on deriving the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant $\det(I-\gamma \mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s)$ as $s \to +\infty$, while simultaneously $\gamma \to 1^-$ in a super-exponential region. In this regime of double scaling limit, our asymptotic result also gives us asymptotics of the eigenvalues $\lambda^{(\alpha, \beta)}_k(s)$ of the integral operator $\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ as $s \to +\infty$. Based on the integrable structure of the confluent hypergeometric kernel, we derive our asymptotic results by applying the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method to analyze the related Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove that dynamically defined Jacobi and CMV matrices associated with generic continuous sampling functions have all gaps predicted by the Gap Labelling Theorem open. We also give a mechanism for generic gap opening for quasi-periodic analytic sampling functions in the subcritical region following from the analyticity of resonance tongue boundaries for both Jacobi and CMV matrices.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness and Orbital Stability of Slow and Fast Solitary Wave Solutions of the Benjamin Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04711v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of existence and properties of solitary waves of the Benjamin equation. The studied equation includes a parameter $\gamma$ in front of the Benjamin-Ono term. We show the existence, uniqueness, decay and orbital stability of solitary wave solutions obtained as a solution to a certain minimization problem, associated either with high speeds without a sign condition on the parameter $\gamma$ or with low speeds for the appropriate sign.</description>

      <title>The search for NLS ground states on a hybrid domain: Motivations, methods, and results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of establishing the existence of the Ground States for the subcritical focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy on a domain made of a line and a plane intersecting at a point. The problem is physically motivated by the experimental realization of hybrid traps for Bose-Einstein Condensates, that are able to concentrate the system on structures close to the domain we consider. In fact, such a domain approximates the trap as the temperature approaches the absolute zero. The spirit of the paper is mainly pedagogical, so we focus on the formulation of the problem and on the explanation of the result, giving references for the technical points and for the proofs.</description>

      <title>Affine Yangians and some cosets of non-rectangular $W$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(q_u-q_{u+1})$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a $W$-algebra associated with $\mathfrak{gl}(\sum_{s=1}^lq_s)$ and a nilpotent element of type $(1^{q_1-q_2},2^{q_2-q_3},\dots,(l-1)^{q_{l-1}-q_l},l^{q_l})$ by using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine Yangian to some cosets of non-rectangular $W$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: non-universality in the scaling region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, "logarithmic divergences" and non-universal short distance contributions in the Wiener-Hopf factors fail to factorize out completely in the re-scaled correlators. This leads to non-universality of the leading large $r$ asymptotics at the order $\frac {e^{-r}}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}$, even when the constant terms are re-scaled to be the same.</description>
