      <title>On the Computational Complexity of Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study computational problems related to the Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ in the real space under the condition that (i) the potential function $V$ is smooth and has its value and derivative bounded within some polynomial of $n$ and (ii) $V$ only consists of $O(1)$-body interactions. We prove that (i) simulating the dynamics generated by the Schr\"odinger operator implements universal quantum computation, i.e., it is BQP-hard, and (ii) estimating the ground energy of the Schr\"odinger operator is as hard as estimating that of local Hamiltonians with no sign problem (a.k.a. stoquastic Hamiltonians), i.e., it is StoqMA-complete. This result is particularly intriguing because the ground energy problem for general bosonic Hamiltonians is known to be QMA-hard and it is widely believed that $\texttt{StoqMA}\varsubsetneq \texttt{QMA}$.</description>

      <title>DQC1-hardness of estimating correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Time-Order Correlation function measures transport properties of dynamical systems. They are ubiquitously used to measure quantum mechanical quantities, such as scrambling times, criticality in phase transitions, and detect onset of thermalisation. We characterise the computational complexity of estimating OTOCs over all eigenstates and show it is Complete for the One Clean Qubit model (DQC1). We then generalise our setup to establish DQC1-Completeness of N-time Correlation functions over all eigenstates. Building on previous results, the DQC1-Completeness of OTOCs and N-time Correlation functions then allows us to highlight a dichotomy between query complexity and circuit complexity of estimating correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Symmetrization maps and minimal border rank Comon's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental open problems in the field of tensors is the border Comon's conjecture: given a symmetric tensor $F\in(\mathbb{C}^n)^{\otimes d}$ for $d\geq 3$, its border and symmetric border ranks are equal. In this paper, we prove the conjecture for large classes of concise tensors in $(\mathbb{C}^n)^{\otimes d}$ of border rank $n$, i.e., tensors of minimal border rank. These families include all tame tensors and all tensors whenever $n\leq d+1$. Our technical tools are border apolarity and border varieties of sums of powers.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</description>

      <title>Polynomial kernels for edge modification problems towards block and strictly chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.13140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider edge modification problems towards block and strictly chordal graphs, where one is given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ and an integer $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and seeks to edit (add or delete) at most $k$ edges from $G$ to obtain a block graph or a strictly chordal graph. The completion and deletion variants of these problems are defined similarly by only allowing edge additions for the former and only edge deletions for the latter. Block graphs are a well-studied class of graphs and admit several characterizations, e.g. they are diamond-free chordal graphs. Strictly chordal graphs, also referred to as block duplicate graphs, are a natural generalization of block graphs where one can add true twins of cut-vertices. Strictly chordal graphs are exactly dart and gem-free chordal graphs. We prove the NP-completeness for most variants of these problems and provide $O(k^2)$ vertex-kernels for Block Graph Edition and Block Graph Deletion, $O(k^3)$ vertex-kernels for Strictly Chordal Completion and Strictly Chordal Deletion and a $O(k^4)$ vertex-kernel for Strictly Chordal Edition.</description>

      <title>Low-degree approximation of QAC$^0$ circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QAC$^0$ is the class of constant-depth quantum circuits with polynomially many ancillary qubits, where Toffoli gates on arbitrarily many qubits are allowed. In this work, we show that the parity function cannot be computed in QAC$^0$, resolving a long-standing open problem in quantum circuit complexity more than twenty years old. As a result, this proves ${\rm QAC}^0 \subsetneqq {\rm QAC}_{\rm wf}^0$. We also show that any QAC circuit of depth $d$ that approximately computes parity on $n$ bits requires $2^{\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/d})}$ ancillary qubits, which is close to tight. This implies a similar lower bound on approximately preparing cat states using QAC circuits. Finally, we prove a quantum analog of the Linial-Mansour-Nisan theorem for QAC$^0$. This implies that, for any QAC$^0$ circuit $U$ with $a={\rm poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits, and for any $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, the correlation between $Q(x)$ and the parity function is bounded by ${1}/{2} + 2^{-\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/d})}$, where $Q(x)$ denotes the output of measuring the output qubit of $U|x,0^a\rangle$. All the above consequences rely on the following technical result. If $U$ is a QAC$^0$ circuit with $a={\rm poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits, then there is a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ of bounded polynomials of degree polylog$(n)$ such that with high probability, a random polynomial from $\mathcal{D}$ approximates the function $\langle x,0^a| U^\dag Z_{n+1} U |x,0^a\rangle$ for a large fraction of $x\in \{0,1\}^n$. This result is analogous to the Razborov-Smolensky result on the approximation of AC$^0$ circuits by random low-degree polynomials.</description>
