      <title>High-speed proton therapy within a short breath-hold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton therapy provides superior dose conformity compared with photon radiotherapy, concentrating radiation within the tumor while sparing adjacent healthy tissue. This advantage has been most effectively realized for static tumors in anatomically stable regions, such as the head and neck. For thoracic and abdominal sites, however, physiological motion remains a critical challenge: because the proton dose distribution is highly sensitive to density variations, long delivery times relative to respiratory motion can compromise accuracy. Existing strategies to accelerate delivery often require substantial hardware modifications or are difficult to translate into routine practice.
  Here we report an optimization that enables high-speed proton delivery (5 to 10 sec per field) on a commercial synchrocyclotron platform without hardware changes. The method combines high-energy shoot-through beams with Bragg-peak delivery, an optimized nearest-neighbor scanning sequence, and a two-pulse dose regulation scheme. Applied to eight lung cancer cases (target volumes 100 to 1000 cc), the approach achieved full field delivery in under 10 sec compatible with a short breath hold while preserving conformity, dose accuracy, and sparing of organs at risk.
  This framework provides a practical route to motion robust proton therapy, improving precision, efficiency and patient tolerance. More broadly, it opens a pathway toward widespread clinical adoption of high-speed proton delivery for moving tumors.</description>

      <title>multimodars: A Rust-powered toolkit for multi-modality cardiac image fusion and registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ cross-section at the CERN n\_TOF facility from subthermal energy to 120 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ reaction is of special interest in three different applications. First, in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy due to the presence of $^{35}Cl$ in brain and skin tissue. Second, it is involved in the creation of $^{36}S$, whose astrophysical origin remains unresolved. Third, in the designing of fast nuclear reactors of new generation based on molten salts. Purpose: To measure the $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ cross-section from thermal energy to 120 keV, determine the resonance parameters in this range and Maxwellian Averaged Cross-Section (MACS). Method: We made use of the Time-of-Flight technique with microMEGAS detectors at Experimental Area 2 (EAR-2) of n\_TOF facility at CERN. The $^{10}B(n, \alpha)^{7}Li$ and $^{235}U(n, f)$ reactions were used as references. Rutherford Back-scattering Spectrometry technique was performed at Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Sevilla, in order to accurately determine the masses of the irradiated samples. Results: We obtain a thermal cross-section of $0.470 \pm 0.009$ barns. The $1/v$ energy dependence of the cross-section is observed up to the first resonance at 0.398 keV, the resonances up to 120 keV are analyzed and MACS calculated for $k_{B} T$ from 1 to 100 keV. Conclusions: The $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ cross-section has been obtained over a wide energy range for the first time, with high accuracy across the aforementioned range. The thermal cross-section and first two resonances are in agreement with latest evaluation in ENDF/B-VIII.1, while lower resonance strength was found for high energy resonances. These data are used to calculate the MACS for different $k_{B} T$.</description>

      <title>PolyPose: Deformable 2D/3D Registration via Polyrigid Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail. Additional visualizations, tutorials, and code are available at https://polypose.csail.mit.edu.</description>
