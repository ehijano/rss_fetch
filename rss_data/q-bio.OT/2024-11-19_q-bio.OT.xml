      <title>How quantum computing can enhance biomarker discovery for multi-factorial diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomarkers play a central role in medicine's gradual progress towards proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, particularly for multi-factorial diseases, has been challenging. Discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective paper, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types - multi-dimensional, time series, and erroneous data - and covers key data modalities in healthcare - electronic health records (EHRs), omics, and medical images. An outlook is provided concerning open research challenges.</description>

      <title>Outward Sodium Current, Fine-structure Constant and Ferroelectric Hysteresis Regimes in the Giant Squid Axon Propagating Action Potential: a Phase Space Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.03575v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A phase space cable equation for the propagation of the functioning action potential is derived. Plots of the ionic current in the recovery region reveal the presence of two outward currents with quasilinear segments. The first one has never been detected with voltage clamp experiments. The plot of currents in the action potential frame of reference reveals that the modulated Ohm's current determines the reversal of the ionic current from incoming to outward in the recovery region. We show that this current is sodium current caused by Ohm current buildup of the electrostatic gradient across the membrane opposing and overwhelming sodium's concentration gradient. Fits of fractions of open sodium channels with the Avrami equation reveal the continuous phase changes of the sodium channels lattice at the inception and at the peak of the action potential. The correlation between the Avrami parameter A and the ionic channel's temperature dependent time rate reveals the role of the fine-structure constant in the passage of ions through channels. Plots of ionic time rates as Boltzmann's kinetic rates yield temperature independent ionic activation and deactivation energies suggesting a potential quantum mechanical influence, such as tunneling. The optimum sodium channel density is calculated that is close to the observed one. It is shown that action potential traverses a heat releasing ferroelectric hysteresis loop with sodium channels traversing two states with different symmetries. Presented results provide the framework for further analysis of excitability, channel's lattice structure, thermodynamic phase behavior, and the role of quantum mechanics mediating the flow of ions through channels. The role of ferroelectric sodium channels behavior has implications for encoding and storing of memories.</description>
