      <title>Artificial Intelligence for CRISPR Guide RNA Design: Explainable Models and Off-Target Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CRISPR-based genome editing has revolutionized biotechnology, yet optimizing guide RNA (gRNA) design for efficiency and safety remains a critical challenge. Recent advances (2020--2025, updated to reflect current year if needed) demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, can markedly improve the prediction of gRNA on-target activity and identify off-target risks. In parallel, emerging explainable AI (XAI) techniques are beginning to illuminate the black-box nature of these models, offering insights into sequence features and genomic contexts that drive Cas enzyme performance. Here we review how state-of-the-art machine learning models are enhancing gRNA design for CRISPR systems, highlight strategies for interpreting model predictions, and discuss new developments in off-target prediction and safety assessment. We emphasize breakthroughs from top-tier journals that underscore an interdisciplinary convergence of AI and genome editing to enable more efficient, specific, and clinically viable CRISPR applications.</description>

      <title>Biomarker Integration and Biosensor Technologies Enabling AI-Driven Insights into Biological Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global population continues to age, there is an increasing demand for ways to accurately quantify the biological processes underlying aging. Biological age, unlike chronological age, reflects an individual's physiological state, offering a more accurate measure of health-span and age-related decline. Aging is a complex, multisystem process involving molecular, cellular, and environmental factors and can be quantified using various biophysical and biochemical markers. This review focuses on four key biochemical markers that have recently been identified by experts as important outcome measures in longevity-promoting interventions: C-Reactive Protein, Insulin like Growth Factor-1, Interleukin-6, and Growth Differentiation Factor-15. With the use of Artificial Intelligence, the analysis and integration of these biomarkers can be significantly enhanced, enabling the identification of complex binding patterns and improving predictive accuracy for biological age estimation and age-related disease risk stratification. Artificial intelligence-driven methods including machine learning, deep learning, and multimodal data integration, facilitate the interpretation of high dimensional datasets and support the development of widely accessible, data-informed tools for health monitoring and disease risk assessment. This paves the way for a future medical system, enabling more personalized and accessible care, offering deeper, data-driven insights into individual health trajectories, risk profiles, and treatment response. The review additionally highlights the key challenges, and future directions for the implementation of artificial intelligence-driven methods in precision aging frameworks.</description>

      <title>Velocity Spectrum Imaging using velocity encoding preparation pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movement of water in the human body is a very complex phenomenon encompassing both diffusion and convection. These different physical principles coexist within the same voxel with dominant sub-mechanisms within different intra-voxel structures. While diffusion imaging techniques can separate diffusion populations, convective flow imaging techniques usually measure an average velocity over the voxel. In this article, we present, test and implement a new technique to measure the velocity distribution of water inside each voxel of an MR image. This approach is completely non-invasive and requires no contrast agents. Modified velocity-selective RF pulses can be used to encode velocity information analogously to k-space encoding. The velocity distribution can then be decoded via the Fourier transform. This approach yields a three-dimensional velocity vector distribution of convective flow in each voxel, analogously to Diffusion Tensor Imaging. We present the theoretical principles of this technique, and demonstrates its use on a simple flow phantom with known flow characteristics. We also demonstrate the technique on human participants used to collect the velocity distribution along the three laboratory axes, and discusses its challenges and potential applications. In addition to a useful tool for validating computational fluid dynamic models in vivo, velocity spectrum imaging can be a powerful tool to study the complex movement of water in the glymphatic system and its involvement in neurodegenerative disorders.</description>

      <title>Identifiability, Sensitivity, and Genetic Algorithms in Bacterial Biofilm Selection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria often develop distinct phenotypes to adapt to environmental stress. In particular, they can produce biofilms, dense communities of bacteria that live in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacterial biofilms provide a safe haven from environmental conditions by distributing metabolic workload and allowing them to perform complex multicellular processes. While previous studies have investigated how bacterial biofilms are regulated under laboratory conditions, they have not considered (1) the data requirements necessary to estimate model parameters and (2) how bacteria respond to recurring stressors in their natural habitats. To address (1), we adapted a mechanistic population model to explore the dynamics of biofilm formation in the presence of predator stress, using synthetic data. We used a Maximum Likelihood Estimation framework to measure crucial parameters underpinning the biofilm formation dynamics. We used genetic algorithms to propose an optimal data collection schedule that minimised parameter identifiability confidence interval widths. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that we could simplify the binding dynamics and eliminate biofilm detachment. To address (2), we proposed a structured version of our model to capture the long-term behaviour and evolutionary selection. In our extended model, the subpopulations feature different maximal rates of biofilm formation. We compared the selection under different predator types and amounts and identified key parameters that affected the speed of selection via sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Distant Metastasis for Head and Neck Cancer Patients Using Multi-Modal Tumor and Peritumoral Feature Fusion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis. This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT) images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex, smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of 0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758). Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation studies indicated complementary information from different modalities. Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Modelling birdsong transmission with methods from molecular sequence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many species of songbirds, juvenile males learn their songs from adult male tutors. In this paper we formulate a novel Markov model for birdsong transmission developed by analogy with models used in biological sequence analysis. We fit the model using the recently developed Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm (IPLA) of Akyildiz et al. (arXiv:2303.13429) and analyse a collection of songs from Java sparrows (Lonchura oryzivora) originally recorded and studied by Masayo Soma and her collaborators. The model proves to have limited predictive power for a number of natural problems associated with song transmission in Java sparrows and we propose reasons for this, including the well-established faithfulness of song-learning and the comparative brevity of Java sparrow songs.</description>

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models (LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Ising energy model for the stochastic prediction of tumor islets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.</description>

      <title>Practical indistinguishability in a gene regulatory network inference problem, a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally inferring mechanistic insights from typical biological data is a challenging pursuit. Even the highest-quality experimental data come with challenges. There are always sources of noise, a limit to how often we can measure the system, and we can rarely measure all the relevant states that participate in the underlying complexity. There are usually sources of uncertainty in model development, which give rise to multiple competing model structures. To underscore the need for further analysis of structural uncertainty in modeling, we use a meta-analysis across six journals covering mathematical biology and show that a huge number of models for biological systems are developed each year, but model selection and comparison across model structures appear to be less common. We walk through a case study involving inference of regulatory network structure involved in a developmental decision in the nematode, \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}. We use real biological data and compare across 13,824 models--each corresponding to a different regulatory network structure, to determine which regulatory features are supported by the data across three experimental conditions. We find that the best-fitting models for each experimental condition share a combination of features and identify a regulatory network that is common across the model sets for each condition. This model can describe the data across the experimental conditions we considered and exhibits a high degree of positive regulation and interconnectivity between the key regulators, \textit{eud-1}, $textit{sult-1}, and \textit{nhr-40}. While the biological results are specific to the molecular biology of development in \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}, the general modeling framework and underlying challenges we faced doing this analysis are widespread across biology, chemistry, physics, and many other scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Inferring processes within dynamic forest models using hybrid modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms. Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step. In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and succession trajectories compared to a mechanistic version of FINN. Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible, improved functional form of the growth process, which we extracted from the DNN using explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.</description>

      <title>Adding a Storage Pool improves 3-PG Tree-ring Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree rings provide long-term records of tree growth and climate changes, which makes them ideal benchmarks for forest modeling. Tree-ring information has greatly improved the reliability of 3-PG, which is one of the most commonly used process-based forest growth models. Here we strengthen 3-PGs ability to simulate tree-ring width and carbon stable isotopes ({\delta}13C) by enhancing its descriptions of tree physiology. The major upgrade was adding a carbon storage pool for tree-ring formation using stored carbohydrates. We also incorporated previous modifications (replacing the age modifier with a height modifier) of 3-PG and tested their efficacy in improving tree-ring simulations. We ran the model based on two grand fir (Abies grandis) stands. The updated model greatly improved the simulations for both tree-ring widths and {\delta}13C. The results represent one of the best tree-ring {\delta}13C simulations, which accurately captured the amplitude in annual variations of {\delta}13C. The correlations (R2) between simulations and observations reached 0.50 and 0.73 at two stands respectively. The new model also greatly improved the simulations of raw tree-ring widths and detrended ring-widths index. Because of better descriptions of tree physiology and more accurate simulations of tree rings than the previous model version, the updated 3-PG should provide more reliable simulations than previous 3-PG versions when tree-ring information is used as benchmark in future studies.</description>

      <title>Extreme Learning Machine for the Characterization of Anomalous Diffusion from Single Trajectories (AnDi-ELM)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the dynamics of natural and artificial systems has provided several examples of deviations from Brownian behavior, generally defined as anomalous diffusion. The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>drGT: Attention-Guided Gene Assessment of Drug Response Utilizing a Drug-Cell-Gene Heterogeneous Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A challenge in drug response prediction is result interpretation compared to established knowledge. drGT is a graph deep learning model that predicts sensitivity and aids in biomarker identification using attention coefficients (ACs). drGT leverages a heterogeneous graph composed of relationships drawn from drugs, genes, and cell line responses. The model is trained and evaluated using major benchmark datasets: Sanger GDSC, NCI60, and Broad CTRP, which cover a wide range of drugs and cancer cell lines. drGT demonstrates AUROC of up to 94.5% under random splitting, 84.4% for unseen drugs, and 70.6% for unseen cell lines, comparable to existing benchmark methods while also providing interpretability. Regarding interpretability, we review drug-gene co-occurrences by text-mining PubMed abstracts for high-coefficient genes mentioning particular drugs. Across 976 drugs from NCI60 with known drug-target interactions (DTIs), model predictions utilized both known DTIs (36.9%) as well as additional predictive associations, many supported by literature. In addition, we compare the drug-gene associations identified by drGT with those from an established DTI prediction model and find that 63.67% are supported by either PubMed literature or predictions from the DTI model. Further, we describe the utilization of ACs to identify affected biological processes by each drug via enrichment analyses, thereby enhancing biological interpretability.
