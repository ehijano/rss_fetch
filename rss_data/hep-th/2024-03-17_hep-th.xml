      <title>Deformation of superintegrability in the Miwa-deformed Gaussian matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an arbitrary deformation of the Gaussian matrix model parameterized by Miwa variables $z_a$. One can look at it as a mixture of the Gaussian and logarithmic (Selberg) potentials, which are both superintegrable. The mixture is not, still one can find an explicit expression for an arbitrary Schur average as a linear transform of a {\it finite degree} polynomial made from the values of skew Schur functions at the Gaussian locus $p_k=\delta_{k,2}$. This linear operation includes multiplication with an exponential $ e^{z_a^2/2}$ and a kind of Borel transform of the resulting product, which we call multiple and enhanced. The existence of such remarkable formulas appears intimately related to the theory of auxiliary $K$-polynomials, which appeared in {\it bilinear} superintegrable correlators at the Gaussian point (strict superintegrability). We also consider in the very detail the generating function of correlators $&lt;(\Tr X)^k&gt;$ in this model, and discuss its integrable determinant representation. At last, we describe deformation of all results to the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

      <title>A modern approach to String Amplitudes and Intersection Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study the properties of String theory amplitudes within the framework of Intersection Theory (IT) for twisted (co)homology, which, as recently proposed, offered a novel approach to analyze relations between scattering amplitudes, in string theory as well as in QFT. As only recently pointed out, thanks to IT, the analytic properties of scattering amplitudes can be related to the topological properties of the manifolds characterizing their integral representation. Tree-level string amplitudes, as well as Feynman integrals, obey both linear and quadratic relations governed by intersection numbers, which act as scalar products between vector spaces. We show how (co)homology with values in a local system allows to interpret closed strings tree amplitudes as intersection numbers between twisted cocycles, and open strings tree amplitudes as parings between a twisted cocycle and a twisted cycle. We present different algorithms to evaluate univariate and multivariate intersection numbers between both log and non-log twisted cocycles. We explore a diagrammatic method for the computation of intersection number between twisted cycles of the moduli space of the n-punctured Riemann sphere. We use IT to rederive Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations, naturally emerging as a twisted version of Riemann period relations. We compute intersection matrix between 2D twisted cycles to explicitly obtain the KLT decomposition of five closed tachyons tree amplitudes into partial five open tachyons tree amplitudes. We explicitly determine the intersection matrix between 2D Parke-Taylor (PT) forms. We use a recursive algorithm for generic n cocycle intersection numbers to project tachyon amplitudes integrand into a PT basis, and we apply it to the scattering of four and five tachyons. The methods discussed in the thesis can be broadly applied to problems involving Aomoto-Gelfand integrals.</description>

      <title>Yukawa Couplings at Infinite Distance and Swampland Towers in Chiral Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study limits of vanishing Yukawa couplings of 4d chiral matter fields in Quantum Gravity, using as a laboratory type IIA orientifolds with D6-branes. In these theories chiral fermions arise at brane intersections, where an infinite tower of charged particles dubbed gonions are localised. We show that in the limit $Y\rightarrow 0$ some of these towers become asymptotically massless, while at the same time the kinetic term of some chiral fields becomes singular and at least two extra dimensions decompactify. For limits parametrised by a large complex structure saxion $u$, Yukawa couplings have a behaviour of the form $Y \, \sim \, {1}/{u^r}$, with $r$ some positive rational number. Moreover, in this limit some of the gauge couplings associated to the Yukawa vanish. The lightest gonion scales are of order $m_{\rm gon} \sim g^s M_{\rm P}$ with $s&gt;1$, verifying the magnetic WGC with room to spare and with no need of its tower/sublattice versions. We also show how this behaviour can be understood in the context of the emergence of kinetic terms in Quantum Gravity. All these results may be very relevant for phenomenology, given the fact that some of the Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are very small.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of GTPs and 5d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make progress in understanding the geometry associated to the Generalized Toric Polygons (GTPs) encoding the Physics of 5d Superconformal Field Theories (SCFTs), by exploiting the connection between Hanany-Witten transitions and the mathematical notion of polytope mutations. From this correspondence, it follows that the singular geometry associated to a GTP is identical to that obtained by regarding it as a standard toric diagram, but with some of its resolutions frozen in way that can be determined from the invariance of the so-called period under mutations. We propose the invariance of the period as a new criterion for distinguishing inequivalent brane webs, which allows us to resolve a puzzle posed in the literature. A second mutation invariant is the Hilbert Series of the geometry. We employ this invariant to perform quantitative checks of our ideas by computing the Hilbert Series of the BPS quivers associated to theories related by mutation. Lastly, we discuss the physical interpretation of a mathematical result ensuring the existence of a flat fibration over $\mathbb{P}^1$ interpolating between geometries connected by mutation, which we identify with recently introduced deformations of the corresponding BPS quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, Wilson surface observables were interpreted as a class of Poisson sigma models. We profit from this construction to define and study the super version of Wilson surfaces. We provide some `proof of concept' examples to illustrate modifications resulting from appearance of odd degrees of freedom in the target.</description>

      <title>On the absence of supergravity solutions for localized, intersecting sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades intersecting D-branes and O-planes have been playing a very important role in string phenomenology in the context of particle physics model building and in the context of flux compactifications. The corresponding supergravity equations are hard to solve so generically solutions only exist in a so-called smeared limit where the delta function sources are replaced by constants. We are showing here that supergravity solutions for two perpendicularly intersecting localized sources in flat space do not exist for a generic diagonal metric Ansatz. We show this for two intersecting sources with p=1,2,3,4,5,6 spatial dimensions that preserve 8 supercharges, and we allow for fully generic fluxes.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow of fermions in the $\CP^2$ (anti-)instanton, and the sphaleron with vanishing topological charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral flow is ubiquitous in the physics of soliton-fermion interacting systems. We study the spectral flows related to a continuous deformation of background soliton solutions, which enable us to develop insight into the emergence of fermionic zero modes and the localization mechanism of fermion densities. We investigate a $\CP^2$ nonlinear sigma model in which there are the (anti-) instantons and also the sphalerons with vanishing topological charge. The standard Yukawa coupling of the fermion successfully generates infinite towers of the spectra and the spectral flow is observed when increasing the size of such solitons. At that moment, the localization of the fermions on the solitons emerges. The avoided crossings are also observed in several stages of the exchange of the flows, they are indicating a manifestation of the fermion exchange of the localizing nature.</description>

      <title>The self-dual Lorentz violating model: quantization, scattering and dual equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analysis the dynamics, at the quantum level, of the self-dual field minimally coupled to bosons with Lorentz symmetry breaking. We quantize the model by applying the Dirac bracket canonical quantization procedure. In addition, we test the relativistic invariance of the model by computing the boson-boson elastic scattering amplitude. Therefore, we show that the Lorentz symmetry breaking has been restored at the quantum level. We finalize our analysis by computing the dual equivalence between the self-dual model with Lorentz symmetry breaking coupled with bosonic matter and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons with Lorentz invariance violation coupled with bosonic field.</description>

      <title>Celestial soft currents at one-loop and their OPEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformally soft operators and their associated soft theorems on the celestial sphere encode the low energy behaviour of bulk scattering amplitudes. They lead to an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra of the celestial CFT at tree-level. In this paper, we introduce new operators in the celestial CFT in order to extend the definition of conformally soft currents to include one-loop effects. We then compute their OPEs with other operators in the theory. We also examine new subtleties that arise in defining OPEs of two conformally soft operators. We elucidate the connection between the new operators and loop corrected soft theorems in the bulk. Finally, we conclude by demonstrating how these operators fit into the framework of a logarithmic CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing recent work by Schnabl-Stettinger and Erbin-Firat, we outline a universal algebraic procedure for `adding stubs' to string field theories obeying the BV quantum master equation. We apply our results to classical and quantum closed string field theory as well as to open-closed string field theory. We also clarify several aspects of the integration-out process in the co-algebraic formulation of string field theory at the quantum level.</description>

Abstract: We review aspects of the Hartle-Hawking no boundary geometry in the context of slow roll inflation. We give an analytic approximation to the geometry and we explain the rationale for the proposal. We also explain why it gives a prediction for the curvature of the universe that is in disagreement with observations and give a quick review of proposed ways to resolve that disagreement.</description>

      <title>Inflationary non-Gaussianities in alpha vacua and consistency with conformal symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conformal invariance of inflationary non-Gaussianities associated with scalar fluctuations in a non-Bunch-Davies initial state, known as the $\alpha$-vacuum, in single-field slow-roll inflation. The $\alpha$-vacuum is a one-parameter family of states, including the Bunch-Davies one, that preserves the conformal symmetry of inflationary dynamics in a nearly de-Sitter space-time. Working within the leading slow-roll approximation, we compute the four-point scalar correlator (the trispectrum) in $\alpha$-vacuum using the in-in formalism. We check that the conformal Ward identities are met between the three and four-point scalar $\alpha$-vacua correlators. Surprisingly, this contrasts the previously reported negative result of the Ward identities being violated between the two and the three-point correlators. We have also extended the wave-functional method, previously used for correlators with Bunch-Davies initial condition, to compute the three and four-point scalar correlators in $\alpha$-vacua. The results obtained from the wave-function method match the corresponding in-in results, adding further justification to our check of Ward identities with $\alpha$-vacua correlators.</description>

      <title>Classically and Quantum Stable Emergent Universe in a Jordan-Brans-Dicke Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.09524v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of Emergent Universe models is based on the assumption that the universe emerged from a past eternal Einstein Static (ES) state towards an inflationary phase and then evolves into a hot big bang era. These models are appealing since they provide specific examples of nonsingular (geodesically complete) inflationary universes. However, it has been pointed out by Mithani-Vilenkin that certain Emergent Universe scenarios which have a classically stable ES state could experience a semiclassical instability and collapse. In this paper, we investigate the classical and quantum stability of the ES regime of Emergent Universes within the framework of Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We demonstrate that when considering these models, it is possible to have both, classical and semiclassical stability of the ES state without addressing the instability highlighted by Mithani-Vilenkin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a constant energy density of the vacuum produces a negative pressure. We show that, in the presence of special boundaries for the photon field, the virtual photons in the quantum vacuum may induce a negative pressure of this type. In this context, we find in particular that an anomalous quantum vacuum radiation is responsible for the appearance of this negative pressure in a system, which generates the tangential Casimir force [Z. Zhang, New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 113036] experienced by parallel conducting plates.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant from the $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ and $\textrm{M87}^\star$ shadow prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) achieved the realization of an image of the supermassive black hole $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ showing an angular shadow diameter $\mathcal{D}= 48.7 \pm 7\mu as$ and the fractional deviation $\mathbf{\delta} = -0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.09}~\text{(VLTI)},-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~\text{(Keck)}$, alongside the earlier image of $\textrm{M87}^\star$ with angular diameter $ \mathcal{D}=42 \pm 3 \mu as$, deviation $\mathbf{\delta}=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and deviations from circularity estimated to be $\Delta \mathcal{C}\lesssim 10\%$. In addition, the shadow radii are assessed within the ranges $3.38 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 6.91$ for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $3.85 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.72$ as well as $3.95 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.92$ for $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and Keck observatories, respectively. These values are provided with $1$-$\sigma$ and $2$-$\sigma$ measurements. Such realizations can unveil a better comprehension of gravitational physics at the horizon scale. In this paper, we use the EHT observational results for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ to elaborate the constraints on parameters of accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant. Concretely, we utilize the mass and distance of both black holes to derive the observables associated with the accelerating black hole shadow. First, we compare our findings with observed quantities such as angular diameter, circularity, shadow radius, and the fractional deviation from the $\textrm{M87}^\star$ data. This comparison reveals constraints within the acceleration parameter and the cosmological constant...
  Lastly, one cannot rule out the possibility of the negative values for the cosmological constant on the emergence of accelerated black hole solutions within the context of minimal gauged supergravity...</description>

      <title>Accelerating AdS black holes in gravity's rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the effect of the energy of moving particles in $C-$metric, we first obtain exact accelerating black hole solutions in gravity's rainbow. Then, we study the effects of gravity's rainbow and $C-$metric parameters on the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, and also the asymptotical behavior of this solution. Next, we indicate how different parameters of the obtained accelerating black holes in gravity's rainbow affect thermodynamics quantities (such as the Hawking temperature, and entropy) and the local stability (by evaluating the heat capacity). In the following, we extract the geodesic equations to determine the effects of various parameters on photon trajectory in the vicinity of this black hole, as well as obtain the radius of the photon sphere and the corresponding critical impact parameter to gain insight into AdS black hole physics by adding the gravity's rainbow to $C-$metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both the Barrow and Tsallis $\delta$ entropies are one-parameter generalizations of the black-hole entropy, with the same microcanonical functional form. The ensuing deformation is quantified by a dimensionless parameter $\Delta$, which in the case of Barrow entropy represents the anomalous dimension, while in Tsallis' case, it describes the deviation of the holographic scaling from extensivity. Here, we utilize the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture with the Barrow--Tsallis entropy to investigate the implications of the related modified Friedmann equations on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. We show that, with the experimental sensitivity of the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, such as the Big Bang Observer, it will be possible to discriminate deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model up to $\Delta\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$.</description>

      <title>The Ba{\l}aban variational problem in the non-linear sigma model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimization of the action of a QFT with a constraint dictated by the block averaging procedure is an important part of Ba{\l}aban's approach to renormalization. It is particularly interesting for QFTs with non-trivial target spaces, such as gauge theories or non-linear sigma models on a lattice. We analyze this step for the $O(4)$ non-linear sigma model in two dimensions and demonstrate, in this case, how various ingredients of Ba{\l}aban's approach play together. First, using variational calculus on Lie groups, the equation for the critical point is derived. Then, this non-linear equation is solved by the Banach contraction mapping theorem. This step requires detailed control of lattice Green functions and their integral kernels via random walk expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the power spectrum of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background produced by standard and biased domain wall networks, using the Velocity-dependent One-Scale model to compute the cosmological evolution of their characteristic scale and root-mean-squared velocity. We consider a standard radiation + $\Lambda \rm CDM$ background and assume that a constant fraction of the energy of collapsing domain walls is emitted in the form of gravitational waves. We show that, in an expanding background, the total energy density in gravitational radiation decreases with cosmic time (after a short initial period of quick growth). We also propose a two parameter model for the scale-dependence of the frequency distribution of the gravitational waves emitted by collapsing domain walls. We determine the corresponding power spectrum of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background generated by domain walls, showing that it is a monotonic decreasing function of the frequency for frequencies larger than that of the peak generated by the walls that have decayed most recently. We also develop an analytical approximation to this spectrum, assuming perfect linear scaling during both the radiation and matter eras, in order to characterize the dependence of the amplitude, peak frequency and slope of the power spectrum on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Gravitating Cylindrical Structures in Modified Gravity: Insights from Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>

      <title>A field theory representation of sum of powers of principal minors and physical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel field theory representation for the Sum of Powers of Principal Minors (SPPM), a mathematical construct with profound implications in quantum mechanics and statistical physics. We begin by establishing a Berezin integral formulation of the SPPM problem, showcasing its versatility through various symmetries including $SU(n)$, its subgroups, and particle-hole symmetry. This representation not only facilitates new analytical approaches but also offers deeper insights into the symmetries of complex quantum systems. For instance, it enables the representation of the Hubbard model's partition function in terms of the SPPM problem. We further develop three mean field techniques to approximate SPPM, each providing unique perspectives and utilities: the first method focuses on the evolution of symmetries post-mean field approximation, the second, based on the bosonic representation, enhances our understanding of the stability of mean field results, and the third employs a variational approach to establish a lower bound for SPPM. These methods converge to identical consistency relations and values for SPPM, illustrating their robustness. The practical applications of our theoretical advancements are demonstrated through two compelling case studies. First, we exactly solve the SPPM problem for the Laplacian matrix of a chain, a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, allowing for precise benchmarking of mean-field theory results. Second, we present the first analytical calculation of the Shannon-R\'enyi entropy for the transverse field Ising chain, revealing critical insights into phase transitions and symmetry breaking in the ferromagnetic phase. This work not only bridges theoretical gaps in understanding principal minors within quantum systems but also sets the stage for future explorations in more complex quantum and statistical physics models.</description>

      <title>Angular and radial stabilities of spontaneously scalarized black holes in the presence of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of spontaneously scalarized black holes (BHs) induced by a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant $R_{\rm GB}^2$. For the scalar-GB coupling $\xi(\phi)=(\eta/8) (\phi^2+\alpha \phi^4)$, where $\eta$ and $\alpha$ are constants, we first show that there are no angular Laplacian instabilities of even-parity perturbations far away from the horizon for large multipoles $l \gg 1$. The deviation of angular propagation speeds from the speed of light is largest on the horizon, whose property can be used to put constraints on the model parameters. For $\alpha \gtrsim -1$, the region in which the scalarized BH is subject to angular Laplacian instabilities can emerge. Provided that $\alpha \lesssim -1$ and $-1/2&lt;\alpha \phi_0^2&lt;-0.1155$, where $\phi_0$ is the field value on the horizon with a unit of the reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}=1$, there are scalarized BH solutions satisfying all the linear stability conditions throughout the horizon exterior. We also study the stability of spontaneously scalarized BHs in scalar-GB theories with a nonminimal coupling $-\beta \phi^2 R/16$, where $\beta$ is a positive constant and $R$ is a Ricci scalar. As the amplitude of the field on the horizon approaches an upper limit $|\phi_0|=4/\sqrt{\beta}$, one of the squared angular propagation speeds $c_{\Omega-}^2$ enters the instability region $c_{\Omega-}^2&lt;0$. So long as $|\phi_0|$ is smaller than a maximum value determined for each $\beta$ in the range $\beta&gt;5$, however, the scalarized BHs are linearly stable in both angular and radial directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have taken on a key role in attempts to confront the growing open questions in standard cosmology. It is important to understand entirely their dynamics at perturbative level including any possible spatial dependence in their growth of large scale structures. In this work, we investigate the spatial dependence of the growth rate of scalar-tensor theories through the M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros equation. We confirm that at subhorizon level this dependence does not play a major role for viable models. However, we establish conditions on which this criterion is met which may be important for developing new models. In our work, we consider three specific models that exhibit spatial dependence of the growth rate at superhorizon modes, which may also be important for early Universe models.</description>

Abstract: We consider self-interacting scalar fields with a conformal coupling in the dS background and study the quantum corrections from bubble loop diagrams. Incorporating the perturbative in-in formalism, we calculate the quantum corrections in the vacuum zero point energy and pressure of self-interacting fields with the potential $V \propto \Phi^n $ for even values of $n$. We calculate the equation of state corresponding to these quantum corrections and examine the scaling of the divergent terms in the vacuum zero point energy and pressure associated to the dimensional regularization scheme. In particular, we show that for quartic self-interacting scalar field the conformal invariance is respected at two-loop order at the conformal point.</description>

      <title>CFT$_D$ from TQFT$_{D+1}$ via Holographic Tensor Network, and Precision Discretisation of CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the path-integral of conformal field theories in $D$ dimensions (CFT$_D$) can be constructed by solving for eigenstates of an RG operator following from the Turaev-Viro formulation of a topological field theory in $D+1$ dimensions (TQFT$_{D+1}$), explicitly realising the holographic sandwich relation between a symmetric theory and a TQFT. Generically, exact eigenstates corresponding to symmetric-TQFT$_D$ follow from Frobenius algebra in the TQFT$_{D+1}$. For $D=2$, we constructed eigenstates that produce 2D rational CFT path-integral exactly, which, curiously connects a continuous field theoretic path-integral with the Turaev-Viro state sum. We also devise and illustrate numerical methods for $D=2,3$ to search for CFT$_D$ as phase transition points between symmetric TQFT$_D$. Finally since the RG operator is in fact an exact analytic holographic tensor network, we compute ``bulk-boundary'' correlator and compare with the AdS/CFT dictionary at $D=2$. Promisingly, they are numerically compatible given our accuracy, although further works will be needed to explore the precise connection to the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Charged AdS Black Holes in Presence of String Cloud and Cardy-Verlinde Formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, charged AdS black holes with a string cloud are taken into consideration. We identify three distinct black hole solutions within a specific temperature range, which subsequently merge into a single black hole beyond this range in the case of spherical space with low chemical potential and string density. However, in the case of large chemical potential and string density, only one black hole solution exists for all temperatures. Notably, we observe that for flat and hyperbolic space, there is only one black hole solution irrespective of the chemical potential and string density. By subtracting the contribution of the extremal black hole from the on-shell Euclidean action, the thermodynamical quantities associated with these black holes are calculated. We also investigate the stability of these black holes and find that medium-sized black hole is unstable. In the dual boundary theory side we verify the existence of bound state of quark-antiquark pair. Finally, we establish the Cardy-Verlinde formula for the boundary theory and we observed an additional energy term arising because of the presence of string cloud.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Topological String/Spectral theory duality on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from the resolution of the cone over the $Y^{N,0}$ singularity. Assuming Kyiv formula, we demonstrate this duality in a special regime thanks to an underlying connection between spectral determinants of quantum mirror curves and the non-autonomous (q)-Toda system. We further exploit this link to connect small and large time expansions in Toda equations. In particular we provide an explicit expression for their tau functions at large time in terms of a strong coupling version of irregular $W_N$ conformal blocks at $c=N-1$. These are related to a special class of multi-cut matrix models which describe the strong coupling regime of four dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the investigation of 2D quantum field theories perturbed by certain types of irrelevant operators. These are the composite field $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$ - constructed out of the components of the stress-energy tensor - and its generalisations - built from higher-spin conserved currents. The effect of such perturbations on the infrared and ultraviolet properties of the theory has been extensively investigated. In the context of integrable quantum field theories, a fruitful perspective is that of factorised scattering theory. In fact, the above perturbations were shown to preserve integrability. The resulting deformed scattering matrices - extensively analysed with the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz - provide the first step in the development of a complete bootstrap program. In this letter we present a systematic approach to computing matrix elements of operators in generalised $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$-perturbed models, based on employing the standard form factor program. Our approach is very general and can be applied to all theories with diagonal scattering. We show that the deformed form factors, just as happens for the $S$-matrix, factorise into the product of the undeformed ones and of a perturbation- and theory-dependent term. From these solutions, correlation functions can be obtained and their asymptotic properties studied. Our results set the foundations of a new research program for massive integrable quantum field theory perturbed by irrelevant operators.</description>

Abstract: In the study of three-dimensional flat holography, the BMS field theory manifests the infinite-dimensional BMS$_3$ symmetry, a powerful tool in elucidating numerous universal phenomena. This paper explores a certain low-temperature limit of the BMS field theory. The primary focus lies in the calculation of the thermal correction to the R\'enyi entropy of the single interval on the cylinder from the replica trick and the uniformizing map. As a double check, an alternative method calculating the entanglement entropy is introduced, with the entanglement first law and the modular Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: The landscape of six-dimensional supergravities is dramatically constrained by the cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies, but the full extent of its implications has not been uncovered. We explore the cancellation of global anomalies of the Dai-Freed type in this setting with abelian and simply laced gauge groups, finding novel constraints. In particular, we exclude arbitrarily large abelian charges in an infinite family of theories for certain types of quadratic refinements, including a specific one defined in the literature. We also show that the Gepner orientifold with no tensor multiplets is anomaly-free for a different choice, as well as a number of heterotic models with and without spacetime supersymmetry in six dimensions. The latter analysis extends previous results in ten dimensions to some lower-dimensional settings in the heterotic landscape.</description>

      <title>Higgs Condensates are Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases: I. Discrete Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Where in the landscape of many-body phases of matter do we place the Higgs condensate of a gauge theory? On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has no local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically connected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as superconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal description of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, utilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus on 2+1D $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected by a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends on the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs phases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has SPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm analytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust upon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined phases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a boundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations. More generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the emergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation between Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase can also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs condensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT phases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge group analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The sequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries, interpreting superconductivity as an SPT property.</description>

      <title>Conformally compact and higher conformal Yang-Mills equations</title>

Abstract: On conformally compact manifolds we study Yang-Mills equations, their boundary conditions, formal asymptotics, and Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps. We find that smooth solutions with "magnetic" Dirichlet boundary data are obstructed by a conformally invariant, higher order boundary current. We study the asymptotics of the interior Yang-Mills energy functional and show that the obstructing current is the variation of the conformally invariant coefficient of the first log term in this expansion which is a higher derivative conformally invariant analog of the Yang-Mills energy. The invariant energy is the anomaly for the renormalized interior Yang-Mills functional and its variation gives higher conformal Yang-Mills equations. Global solutions to the magnetic boundary problem determine higher order "electric" Neumann data. This yields the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We also construct conformally invariant, higher transverse derivative boundary operators. Acting on interior connections, they give obstructions to solving the Yang-Mills boundary problem, determine the asymptotics of formal solutions, and yield conformally invariant tensors capturing the (non-local) electric Neumann data. We also characterize a renormalized Yang-Mills action functional that encodes global features analogously to the renormalized volume for Poincar\'e-Einstein structures.</description>

      <title>Normal modes of Proca fields in AdS$_d$ spacetime</title>

Abstract: The normal modes of Proca field perturbations in $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, AdS$_d$ for short, with reflective Dirichlet boundary conditions, are obtained exactly. Within the Ishibashi-Kodama framework, we decompose the Proca field in scalar-type and vector-type components, according to their tensorial behavior on the $(d-2)$-sphere $\mathcal{S}^{d-2}$. Two of the degrees of freedom of the Proca field are described by scalar-type components, which in general are coupled due to the mass of the field, but in AdS$_d$ we show that they can be decoupled. The other $d-3$ degrees of freedom of the field are described by a vector-type component that generically decouples completely. The normal modes and their frequencies for both the scalar-type and vector-type components of the Proca field are then obtained analytically. Additionally, we analyze the normal modes of the Maxwell field as the massless limit of the Proca field. We find that for scalar-type perturbations in $d=4$ there is a discontinuity in the massless limit, in $d=5$ the massless limit is well defined using Dirichlet-Neumann rather than Dirichlet boundary conditions, and in $d&gt;5$ the massless limit is completely well defined, i.e., it is obtained smoothly from the massless limit of the scalar-type perturbations of the Proca field. For vector-type perturbations the Maxwell field limit is obtained smoothly for all $d$ from the massless limit of the vector-type perturbations of the Proca field.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter from inflation-driven quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to produce axion dark matter from inflationary fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations during inflation are strengthened by a coupling of the axion kinetic term to the inflaton, which we parametrize as an effective curvature $\kappa$ in the axion equation of motion. A nonvanishing curvature breaks the scale invariance of the axion power spectrum, driving a quantum phase transition with $\kappa$ as the order parameter. The axion power spectrum is proportional to the inverse comoving horizon to the power of $\kappa$. For positive $\kappa$ the spectrum gets a red tilt, leading to an exponential enhancement of the axion abundance as the comoving horizon shrinks during inflation. This enhancement allows sufficient axion production to comprise the entire dark matter relic abundance despite the ultralight mass. Our mechanism predicts a significantly different parameter space from the usual misalignment mechanism. It allows for axion-like particle dark matter with a much lower decay constant and thus a larger coupling to Standard Model particles. Much of the parameter space can be probed by future experiments including haloscopes, nuclear clocks, CASPEr, and CMB-S4. We can also generate heavier QCD axion dark matter than the misalignment mechanism.</description>
