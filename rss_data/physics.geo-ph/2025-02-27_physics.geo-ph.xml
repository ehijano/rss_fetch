      <title>Long-term propagation of CO2 plume below the seal accounting for chemical reactions and water counter-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of long-term CO2 plume migration beneath seals is crucial for the viability of CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers. Groundwater counterflow and chemical reactions between CO2, brine, and rock significantly influence plume dynamics, dispersion, and boundary evolution. This study develops a novel analytical framework by deriving governing equations for gravity-driven gas migration and obtaining exact self-similar solutions for both pulse and continuous injection. The approach explicitly incorporates chemical reactions and water counterflow, addressing factors often neglected in existing analytical models. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of key parameters on CO2 migration. The results show that increasing the chemical reaction coefficient delays the first arrival of CO2 while accelerating its final arrival, highlighting the impact of geochemical reactions on plume migration. Additionally, higher up-dip water velocity shortens the accumulation period, thereby reducing the time required for CO2 to become trapped in geological formations. These findings improve predictive capabilities for long-term CO2 storage and provide insights for optimising sequestration strategies.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven and Theory-Guided Pseudo-Spectral Seismic Imaging Using Deep Neural Network Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) reconstructs high-resolution subsurface models via multi-variate optimization but faces challenges with solver selection and data availability. Deep Learning (DL) offers a promising alternative, bridging data-driven and physics-based methods. While FWI in DL has been explored in the time domain, the pseudo-spectral approach remains underutilized, despite its success in classical FWI.
  This thesis integrates pseudo-spectral FWI into DL, formulating both data-driven and theory-guided approaches using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These methods were theoretically derived, tested on synthetic and Marmousi datasets, and compared with deterministic and time-domain approaches.
  Results show that data-driven pseudo-spectral DNNs outperform classical FWI in deeper and over-thrust regions due to their global approximation capability. Theory-guided RNNs yield greater accuracy, with lower error and better fault identification. While DNNs excel in velocity contrast recovery, RNNs provide superior edge definition and stability in shallow and deep sections.
  Beyond enhancing FWI performance, this research identifies broader applications of DL-based inversion and outlines future directions for these frameworks.</description>

      <title>Streamer-like red line diffuse auroras driven by time domain structures and ECH waves associated with a plasma injection and braking ion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auroral streamers are important meso-scale processes of dynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, typically studied using imagers sensitive to energetic (&gt;1 keV) electron precipitation, such as all-sky imagers (ASIs). This paper reports streamer-like red-line auroras, representing low-energy (&lt;1 keV) precipitation, observed poleward of a black aurora and an auroral torch. These red-line auroras were associated with a magnetospheric electron injection and braking ion flows. Observations were made using the THEMIS spacecraft and ground-based imagers, including the ASI, REGO, and meridian scanning photometer (MSP) at Fort Smith. We identify plasma sheet electron pitch-angle scattering by time-domain structures (TDSs) and electron cyclotron harmonics (ECH) waves as the driver of these red-line auroras, because of (1) a strong correlation (~0.9) between observed red-line intensities and precipitating fluxes; (2) consistent red-line intensities from auroral transport code forward modeling, and (3) consistent precipitation characteristic energies from MSP optical inference and quasi-linear estimates.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the ability of IceCube DeepCore to probe Earth's interior with atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is an optical Cherenkov detector instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth's electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth's mass and moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>The prebiotic pathway from P-bearing iron meteorites to phosphates by DFT modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the biogenic macroelements, phosphorus is the one bringing the most fascinating and unsolved mysteries for what concern its prebiotic history. It possibly landed on Earth as a metal phosphide (Schreibersite, (Fe,Ni)3P), throughout the Heavy Meteor Bombardment during the Archean Era. Its subsequent corrosion by water led to P-oxygenated compounds, which is the subject of this kinetic computational study, thus complementing our previous thermodynamic characterization. The reaction was studied at periodic DFT level, simulating the water corrosion reaction on the reactive Fe2NiP Schreibersite (001)2 surface. Results show that the timescale of the reaction at 350 K is of few hours.</description>

      <title>Highly Localised Droplet Clustering in Shallow Cumulus Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth, lifetime, number density, and size of water droplets in warm atmospheric clouds determine the evolution, lifetime and light transmission properties of those clouds. These small-scale cloud properties, in addition to precipitation initiation, have strong implications for the Earth's energy budget since warm clouds cover large geographic areas. Spatio-temporal correlations on the millimetre scale and smaller may or may not affect these properties of clouds. To date, the pioneering measurements of such correlations in marine stratocumulus clouds have relied on averaging over holographically reconstructed volumes spanning at least ten kilometres. These have revealed weak but widespread spatial clustering of cloud droplets. Here we present results of strong localised clustering on scales of half a metre or less from holographic measurements collected with the Max Planck CloudKite in shallow cumulus clouds in the mid-Atlantic trade wind region near Barbados, with a spatial separation of only 12~cm between measurement volumes. This observation challenges the foundations of our understanding of cloud microphysics at the droplet scale, with implications for cloud modelling in weather and climate prediction.</description>

      <title>Distributed acoustic sensing for ocean applications</title>

Abstract: Extensive monitoring of acoustic activities is important for many fields, including biology, security, oceanography, and Earth science. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an evolving technique for continuous, wide-coverage measurements of mechanical vibrations, which is suited to ocean applications. DAS illuminates an optical fiber with laser pulses and measures the backscattered wave due to small random variations in the refractive index of the material. Specifically, DAS uses coherent optical interferometry to measure the phase difference of the backscattered wave from adjacent locations along the fiber. External stimuli, such as mechanical strain due to acoustic wavefields impinging on the fiber-optic cable, modulate the backscattered wave. Hence, the differential phase measurements of the optical backscatter are proportional to the underlying physical quantities of the surrounding wavefield. Continuous measurement of the backscattered electromagnetic signal provides a distributed sensing modality that extends spatially along the fiber. We provide an overview of DAS technology and detail the underlying physics, from electromagnetic to mechanical and eventually acoustic quantities. We explain the effect of DAS acquisition parameters in signal processing and show the potential of DAS for sound source detection on data collected from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array https://doi.org/10.58046/5J60-FJ89.</description>

      <title>Fast, Scale-Adaptive, and Uncertainty-Aware Downscaling of Earth System Model Fields with Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.</description>
