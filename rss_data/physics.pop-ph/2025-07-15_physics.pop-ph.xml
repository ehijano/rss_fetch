      <title>Quantum Listenings -- Amateur Sonification of Vacuum and other Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensory perceptions of vision and sound may be considered as complementary doorways towards interpreting and understanding physical phenomena. We provide a few selected samples where scientific data of systems usually not directly accessible to humans may be listened to. The examples are chosen close to the regime where quantum mechanics is applicable. Visual and auditory renderings are compared with some connections to music, illustrating in particular a kind of fractal complexity along the time axis.</description>

      <title>Astro-COLIBRI: Empowering Citizen Scientists in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of real-time astronomy, citizen scientists play an increasingly important role in the discovery and follow-up of transient astrophysical phenomena. From local astronomical societies to global initiatives, amateur astronomers contribute valuable observational data that complement professional efforts. Astro-COLIBRI facilitates these contributions by providing a user-friendly platform that integrates real-time alerts, data visualization tools, and collaborative features to support astronomers at all levels.
  The Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program provides engagement opportunities across multiple scales. At the grassroots level, we collaborate with local astronomy clubs, equipping them with accessible tools for transient event monitoring. National and international networks, such as RAPAS in France, leverage Astro-COLIBRI's real-time capabilities for coordinated observations. On a global scale, we actively participate in high-impact citizen science and capacity building initiatives, including the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Citizen Science Program and the "Open Universe" initiative led by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). These collaborations enhance the accessibility of real-time astrophysical data and foster inclusive participation in cutting-edge astronomy.
  In this contribution, we will present the Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program, highlighting its technical framework, community impact, and case studies of successful amateur contributions. We will showcase how our platform facilitates the rapid exchange of information between professional and amateur astronomers, democratizing access to multi-messenger astrophysics and enabling the global community to contribute meaningfully to time-domain discoveries.</description>
