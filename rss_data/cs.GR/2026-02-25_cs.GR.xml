      <title>Directly from Alpha to Omega: Controllable End-to-End Vector Floor Plan Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated floor plan generation aims to create residential layouts by arranging rooms within a given boundary, balancing topological, geometric, and aesthetic considerations. The existing methods typically use a multi-step pipeline with intermediate representations to decompose the prediction process into several sub-tasks, limiting model flexibility and imposing predefined solution paths. This often results in unreasonable outputs when applied to data unsuitable for these predefined paths, making it challenging for these methods to match human designers, who do not restrict themselves to a specific set of design workflows. To address these limitations, we introduce CE2EPlan, a controllable end-to-end topology- and geometry-enhanced diffusion model that removes restrictions on the generative process of AI design tools. Instead, it enables the model to learn how to design floor plans directly from data, capturing a wide range of solution paths from input boundaries to complete layouts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all existing approaches using the multi-step pipeline, delivering higher-quality results with enhanced user control and greater diversity in output, bringing AI design tools closer to the versatility of human designers.</description>

      <title>Skullptor: High Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction in Seconds with Multi-View Normal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity 3D head geometry from images is critical for a wide range of applications, yet existing methods face fundamental limitations. Traditional photogrammetry achieves exceptional detail but requires extensive camera arrays (25-200+ views), substantial computation, and manual cleanup in challenging areas like facial hair. Recent alternatives present a fundamental trade-off: foundation models enable efficient single-image reconstruction but lack fine geometric detail, while optimization-based methods achieve higher fidelity but require dense views and expensive computation. We bridge this gap with a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method introduces a multi-view surface normal prediction model that extends monocular foundation models with cross-view attention to produce geometrically consistent normals in a feed-forward pass. We then leverage these predictions as strong geometric priors within an inverse rendering optimization framework to recover high-frequency surface details. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-image and multi-view methods, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction on par with dense-view photogrammetry while reducing camera requirements and computational cost. The code and model will be released.</description>
