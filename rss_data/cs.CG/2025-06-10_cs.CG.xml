      <title>On geodesic disks enclosing many points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \Pi(n) $ be the largest number such that for every set $ S $ of $ n $ points in a polygon~$ P $, there always exist two points $ x, y \in S $, where every geodesic disk containing $ x $ and $ y $ contains $ \Pi(n) $ points of~$ S $. We establish upper and lower bounds for $ \Pi(n)$, and show that $ \left\lceil \frac{n}{5}\right\rceil+1 \leq \Pi(n) \leq \left\lceil \frac{n}{4} \right\rceil +1 $. We also show that there always exist two points $x, y\in S$ such that every geodesic disk with $x$ and $y$ on its boundary contains at least $ \frac{n}{3+\sqrt{5}} \approx \left\lceil \frac{n}{5.2} \right\rceil$ points both inside and outside the disk. For the special case where the points of $ S $ are restricted to be the vertices of a geodesically convex polygon we give a tight bound of $\left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil + 1$. We provide the same tight bound when we only consider geodesic disks having $ x $ and $ y $ as diametral endpoints. We give upper and lower bounds of $\left\lceil \frac{n}{5} \right\rceil + 1 $ and $\frac{n}{6+\sqrt{26}} \approx \left\lceil \frac{n}{11.1} \right\rceil$, respectively, for the two-colored version of the problem. Finally, for the two-colored variant we show that there always exist two points $x, y\in S$ where $x$ and $y$ have different colors and every geodesic disk with $x$ and $y$ on its boundary contains at least $\lceil \frac{n}{11.3}\rceil+1$ points both inside and outside the disk.</description>

      <title>Rectangular Duals on the Cylinder and the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rectangular dual of a plane graph $G$ is a contact representation of $G$ by interior-disjoint rectangles such that (i) no four rectangles share a point, and (ii) the union of all rectangles is a rectangle. In this paper, we study rectangular duals of graphs that are embedded in surfaces other than the plane. In particular, we fully characterize when a graph embedded on a cylinder admits a cylindrical rectangular dual. For graphs embedded on the flat torus, we can test whether the graph has a toroidal rectangular dual if we are additionally given a \textit{regular edge labeling}, i.e. a combinatorial description of rectangle adjacencies. Furthermore we can test whether there exists a toroidal rectangular dual that respects the embedding and that resides on a flat torus for which the sides are axis-aligned. Testing and constructing the rectangular dual, if applicable, can be done efficiently.</description>

      <title>Three Edge-disjoint Plane Spanning Paths in a Point Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following problem: Given a set $S$ of $n$ distinct points in the plane, how many edge-disjoint plane straight-line spanning paths can be drawn on $S$? Each spanning path must be crossing-free, but edges from different paths are allowed to intersect at arbitrary points. It is known that if the points of $S$ are in convex position, then $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ such paths always exist. However, for general point sets, the best known construction yields only two edge-disjoint plane spanning paths.
  In this paper, we prove that for any set $S$ of at least ten points in general position (i.e., no three points are collinear), it is always possible to draw at least three edge-disjoint plane straight-line spanning paths. Our proof relies on a structural result about halving lines in point sets and builds on the known two-path construction, which we also strengthen: we show that for any set $S$ of at least six points, and for any two specified points on the boundary of the convex hull of $S$, there exist two edge-disjoint plane spanning paths that start at those prescribed points.
  Finally, we complement our positive results with a lower bound: for every $n \geq 6$, there exists a set of $n$ points for which no more than $\lceil n/3 \rceil$ edge-disjoint plane spanning paths are possible.</description>

      <title>Structural Validation Of Synthetic Power Distribution Networks Using The Multiscale Flat Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of comparing a pair of geometric networks that may not be similarly defined, i.e., when they do not have one-to-one correspondences between their nodes and edges. Our motivating application is to compare power distribution networks of a region. Due to the lack of openly available power network datasets, researchers synthesize realistic networks resembling their actual counterparts. But the synthetic digital twins may vary significantly from one another and from actual networks due to varying underlying assumptions and approaches. Hence the user wants to evaluate the quality of networks in terms of their structural similarity to actual power networks. But the lack of correspondence between the networks renders most standard approaches, e.g., subgraph isomorphism and edit distance, unsuitable.
  We propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA.</description>

      <title>SOLIDGEO: Measuring Multimodal Spatial Math Reasoning in Solid Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometry is a fundamental branch of mathematics and plays a crucial role in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing multimodal mathematics benchmarks mainly focus on plane geometry and largely ignore solid geometry, which requires spatial reasoning and is more challenging than plane geometry. To address this critical gap, we introduce SolidGeo, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks in solid geometry. SolidGeo consists of 3,113 real-world K-12 and competition-level problems, each paired with visual context and annotated with difficulty levels and fine-grained solid geometry categories. Our benchmark covers a wide range of 3D reasoning subjects such as projection, unfolding, spatial measurement, and spatial vector, offering a rigorous testbed for assessing solid geometry. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in solid geometry math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on SolidGeo. Moreover, we analyze the performance, inference efficiency and error patterns of various models, offering insights into the solid geometric mathematical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We hope SolidGeo serves as a catalyst for advancing MLLMs toward deeper geometric reasoning and spatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Computing Diverse and Nice Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of computing diverse triangulations to a given polygon. Given a simple $n$-gon $P$, an integer $ k \geq 2 $, a quality measure $\sigma$ on the set of triangulations of $P$ and a factor $ \alpha \geq 1 $, we formulate the Diverse and Nice Triangulations (DNT) problem that asks to compute $k$ \emph{distinct} triangulations $T_1,\dots,T_k$ of $P$ such that a) their diversity, $\sum_{i &lt; j} d(T_i,T_j) $, is as large as possible \emph{and} b) they are nice, i.e., $\sigma(T_i) \leq \alpha \sigma^* $ for all $1\leq i \leq k$. Here, $d$ denotes the symmetric difference of edge sets of two triangulations, and $\sigma^*$ denotes the best quality of triangulations of $P$, e.g., the minimum Euclidean length.
  As our main result, we provide a $\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$-time approximation algorithm for the DNT problem that returns a collection of $k$ distinct triangulations whose diversity is at least $1 - \Theta(1/k)$ of the optimal, and each triangulation satisfies the quality constraint. This is accomplished by studying \emph{bi-criteria triangulations} (BCT), which are triangulations that simultaneously optimize two criteria, a topic of independent interest. We complement our approximation algorithms by showing that the DNT problem and the BCT problem are NP-hard.
  Finally, for the version where diversity is defined as $\min_{i &lt; j} d(T_i,T_j) $, we show a reduction from the problem of computing optimal Hamming codes, and provide an $n^{O(k)}$-time $\tfrac12$-approximation algorithm. This improves over the naive ${C_{n-2} \choose k} \approx 2^{O(nk)}$ time bound for enumerating all $k$-tuples among the triangulations of a simple $n$-gon, where $C_n$ denotes the $n$-th Catalan number.</description>

      <title>Learning Pareto-Optimal Rewards from Noisy Preferences: A Framework for Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure. We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering $\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and value-pluralistic environment.</description>
