      <title>An exploratory calculation of $K_{\rm L}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from Lattice QCD at physical pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude which contributes to the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from lattice QCD. We use a $24^3\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\infty$-based formalism. Our implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a destructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the decay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The precision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical contribution of the $\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are tested and compared.</description>

      <title>On-shell Matrix Elements of the EMT Trace in Gauge Theories and Heavy Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel diagrammatic proof of the identity between the forward matrix element of the energy-momentum-tensor (EMT) trace operator over a single particle's on-shell state and its perturbative pole mass to any loop orders in perturbative gauge theories (with gauge bosons and fermions), without appealing to any pre-laid operator renormalization conditions or Ward identities. The proof is based on the equation of mass-dimensional analysis in dimensional regularization, the topological properties of contributing Feynman diagrams and the on-shell renormalization condition. Considering for definiteness perturbative QED and QCD with at most one fermion kept massive, we have verified the aforementioned identity, up to three loops, for all elementary particles through direct computation of dimensionally-regularized matrix elements of the relevant bare operators. We observe interestingly that the trace-anomaly contribution seemingly contains all leading-renormalon effects (explicitly verified up to three loops), and we propose accordingly a new scheme- and scale-independent trace-anomaly-subtracted mass definition for heavy $t$-,$\,b$-,$\,c$-quarks and electrons. A list of amusing numbers is subsequently presented for the composition of their perturbative pole masses.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies have enabled quantum simulation of gauge theories -- some of the most fundamental frameworks of nature -- in regimes far from equilibrium, where classical computation is severely limited. These simulators, primarily based on neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits, hold the potential to address long-standing questions in nuclear, high-energy, and condensed-matter physics, and may ultimately allow first-principles studies of matter evolution in settings ranging from the early universe to high-energy collisions. Research in this rapidly growing field is also driving the convergence of concepts across disciplines and uncovering new phenomena. In this Review, we highlight recent experimental and theoretical developments, focusing on phenomena accessible in current and near-term quantum simulators, including particle production and string breaking, collision dynamics, thermalization, ergodicity breaking, and dynamical quantum phase transitions. We conclude by outlining promising directions for future research and opportunities enabled by available quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Trading Mathematical for Physical Simplicity: Bialgebraic Structures in Matrix Product Operator Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in the lattice representation theory of (generalized) symmetries, many simple quantum spin chains of physical interest are not included in the rigid framework of fusion categories and weak Hopf algebras. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by relaxing the requirements on the underlying algebraic structure, and show that general matrix product operator symmetries are described by a pre-bialgebra. As a guiding example, we focus on the anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the XX model, which manifests the mixed anomaly between its $U(1)$ momentum and winding symmetry. We show how this anomaly is embedded into the non-semisimple corepresentation category, providing a novel mechanism for realizing such anomalous symmetries on the lattice. Additionally, the representation category which describes the renormalization properties is semisimple and semi-monoidal, which provides a new class of mixed state renormalization fixed points. Finally, we show that up to a quantum channel, this anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is equivalent to a more conventional MPO symmetry obtained on the boundary of a double semion model. In this way, our work provides a bridge between well-understood topological defect symmetries and those that arise in more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Violation and large-$N_c$ spin-flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the contribution of the QCD $\bar \theta$ term to the CP violating pion-nucleon couplings and the nucleon electric dipole moment in a combined large-$N_c$ and chiral perturbation theory framework. In particular, we approach this issue through the emergent spin-flavor symmetry of the baryon sector at large but finite $N_c$. We obtain good agreement with previous analyses for the pion-nucleon couplings and show that the large-$N_c$ framework indicates that tree-level contributions to the electric dipole moment possibly play a dominant role. The spin-flavor symmetry also enables us to provide novel constraints on CP violating pion-$\Delta$ couplings as well as the $\Delta$ electric dipole moment and $\Delta N$ transition moment.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and color charge fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

      <title>The NN$\Omega_{ccc}$ three-body resonance with the HAL QCD interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Newly, first-principles lattice QCD results at the physical pion mass, $ m_\pi \backsimeq 137.1 $ MeV, have been reported by the HAL QCD Collaboration for the S-wave interaction between the nucleon (N) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{ccc}$). The N$\Omega_{ccc}$ potentials in the spin-1 $ \left(^{3}S_{1}\right) $ and spin-2 $ \left(^{5}S_{2}\right) $ channels were derived and found to be attractive, though no bound state was supported in these channels. It is shown that, when the spin-1 and spin-2 N$\Omega_{ccc}$ channels are combined with the realistic NN Malfliet-Tjon (MT) potential in the $ ^{3}S_{1} $ channel, near-threshold resonances of deuteron (d)-$\Omega_{ccc}$ are generated with energies near 1.3 MeV and 1.2 MeV below the three-body breakup threshold for the states with quantum numbers $(I)J^{\pi} = (0)1/2^{+}$ and $(0)5/2^{+}$, respectively. And no bound state is found for the NN$\Omega_{ccc}$ system.</description>

      <title>Scattering and induced false vacuum decay in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis of Ising models, Part III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended in this work to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of stochastic geometric representations are presented here in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.</description>
