      <title>Timely Remote Estimation with Memory at the Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a remote estimation system that estimates a time-varying target based on sensor data transmitted over wireless channel. Due to transmission errors, some data packets fail to reach the receiver. To mitigate this, the receiver uses a buffer to store recently received data packets, which allows for more accurate estimation from the incomplete received data. Our research focuses on optimizing the transmission scheduling policy to minimize the estimation error, which is quantified as a function of the age of information vector associated with the buffered packets. Our results show that maintaining a buffer at the receiver results in better estimation performance for non-Markovian sources.</description>

      <title>RainGaugeNet: CSI-Based Sub-6 GHz Rainfall Attenuation Measurement and Classification for ISAC Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rainfall impacts daily activities and can lead to severe hazards such as flooding. Traditional rainfall measurement systems often lack granularity or require extensive infrastructure. While the attenuation of electromagnetic waves due to rainfall is well-documented for frequencies above 10 GHz, sub-6 GHz bands are typically assumed to experience negligible effects. However, recent studies suggest measurable attenuation even at these lower frequencies. This study presents the first channel state information (CSI)-based measurement and analysis of rainfall attenuation at 2.8 GHz. The results confirm the presence of rain-induced attenuation at this frequency, although classification remains challenging. The attenuation follows a power-law decay model, with the rate of attenuation decreasing as rainfall intensity increases. Additionally, rainfall onset significantly increases the delay spread. Building on these insights, we propose RainGaugeNet, the first CSI-based rainfall classification model that leverages multipath and temporal features. Using only 20 seconds of CSI data, RainGaugeNet achieved over 90% classification accuracy in line-of-sight scenarios and over 85% in non-lineof-sight scenarios, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Scattering Environment Aware Joint Multi-user Channel Estimation and Localization with Spatially Reused Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of users leads to an increase in pilot overhead, and the limited pilot resources make it challenging to support all users using orthogonal pilots. By fully capturing the inherent physical characteristics of the multi-user (MU) environment, it is possible to reduce pilot costs and improve the channel estimation performance. In reality, users nearby may share the same scatterer, while users further apart tend to have orthogonal channels. This paper proposes a two-timescale approach for joint MU uplink channel estimation and localization in MIMO-OFDM systems, which fully captures the spatial characteristics of MUs. To accurately represent the structure of the MU channel, the channel is modeled in the 3-D location domain. In the long-timescale phase, the time-space-time multiple signal classification (TST-MUSIC) algorithm initially offers a rough approximation of scatterer positions for each user, which is subsequently refined through the scatterer association algorithm based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The BS then utilizes this prior information to apply a graph-coloring-based user grouping algorithm, enabling spatial division multiplexing of pilots and reducing pilot overhead. In the short timescale phase, a low-complexity scattering environment aware location-domain turbo channel estimation (SEA-LD-TurboCE) algorithm is introduced to merge the overlapping scatterer information from MUs, facilitating high-precision joint MU channel estimation and localization under spatially reused pilots. Simulation results verify the superior channel estimation and localization performance of our proposed scheme over the baselines.</description>

      <title>Digital Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding with Blind Training for Adaptive Modulation and Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel digital deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) framework that achieves robust performance across diverse communication environments without requiring extensive retraining and prior knowledge of communication environments. Traditional digital DeepJSCC techniques often face challenges in adapting to various communication environments, as they require significant training overhead and large amounts of communication data to develop either multiple specialized models or a single generalized model, in pre-defined communication environments. To address this challenge, in our framework, an error-adaptive blind training strategy is devised, which eliminates the need for prior knowledge of communication environments. This is achieved by modeling the relationship between the encoder's output and the decoder's input using binary symmetric channels, and optimizing bit-flip probabilities by treating them as trainable parameters. In our framework, a training-aware communication strategy is also presented, which dynamically selects the optimal encoder-decoder pair and transmission parameters based on current channel conditions. In particular, in this strategy, an adaptive power and modulation control method is developed to minimize the total transmission power, while maintaining high task performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing DeepJSCC methods, achieving higher peak signal-to-noise ratio, lower power consumption, and requiring significantly fewer encoder-decoder pairs for adaptation.</description>

      <title>EOG Communication Interface for Quadriplegics: Prototype &amp; Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrooculography (EOG) is an electrophysiological signal that determines the human eye orientation and is therefore widely used in Human Tracking Interfaces (HCI). The purpose of this project is to develop a communication method for quadriplegic patients using EOG signals aimed at text and voice generation. The system consists of 3D eye movement tracking embedded using a custom-built prototype to measure the eyeball's left-right and up-down movements. The ESP32 board, which has a set of parameters to convert the data into content displayed on LCDs and MP3 players, is used to capture and process the signal. helps people by facilitating more natural and efficient symptom expression. The blink system will be able to incorporate face masks and more eye tests as it continues to develop. Even if it might work, more research and clinical trials are needed to evaluate the system's usefulness and ensure that it performs as planned in real-world scenarios. With this project, assistive technology will make significant progress and improve the lives of many who suffer from severe motor impairments.</description>

      <title>Aerial Active STAR-RIS-Aided IoT NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel framework of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) communications with the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed for Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. In particular, an active STAR-RIS is deployed onboard to enhance the communication link between the base station (BS) and the IoT devices, and NOMA is utilized for supporting the multi-device connectivity. Based on the proposed framework, a system sum rate maximization problem is formulated for the joint optimization of the active STAR-RIS beamforming, the UAV trajectory design, and the power allocation. To solve the non-convex problem with highly-coupled variables, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to decouple the original problem into three subproblems. Specifically, for the active STAR-RIS beamforming, the amplification coefficient, the power-splitting ratio, and the phase shift are incorporated into a combined variable to simplify the optimization process. Afterwards, the penalty-based method is invoked for handling the non-convex rank-one constraint. For the UAV trajectory design and the power allocation subproblems, the successive convex optimization method is applied for iteratively approximating the local-optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance compared to the benchmarks in terms of the sum rate; and 2) the UAV-mounted active STAR-RIS can effectively enhance the channel gain from the BS to the IoT devices by the high-quality channel construction and the power compensation.</description>

      <title>Remote Inference over Dynamic Links via Adaptive Rate Deep Task-Oriented Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broad range of technologies rely on remote inference, wherein data acquired is conveyed over a communication channel for inference in a remote server. Communication between the participating entities is often carried out over rate-limited channels, necessitating data compression for reducing latency. While deep learning facilitates joint design of the compression mapping along with encoding and inference rules, existing learned compression mechanisms are static, and struggle in adapting their resolution to changes in channel conditions and to dynamic links. To address this, we propose Adaptive Rate Task-Oriented Vector Quantization (ARTOVeQ), a learned compression mechanism that is tailored for remote inference over dynamic links. ARTOVeQ is based on designing nested codebooks along with a learning algorithm employing progressive learning. We show that ARTOVeQ extends to support low-latency inference that is gradually refined via successive refinement principles, and that it enables the simultaneous usage of multiple resolutions when conveying high-dimensional data. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme yields remote deep inference that operates with multiple rates, supports a broad range of bit budgets, and facilitates rapid inference that gradually improves with more bits exchanged, while approaching the performance of single-rate deep quantization methods.</description>

      <title>Scaling Achievable Rates in SIM-aided MIMO Systems with Metasurface Layers: A Hybrid Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the achievable rate (AR) of a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM)-aided holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) system by jointly optimizing the SIM phase shifts and power allocation. Contrary to earlier studies suggesting that the AR decreases when the number of metasurface layers increases past a certain point for \emph{a fixed SIM thickness}, our findings demonstrate consistent increase. To achieve this, we introduce two problem formulations: one based on directly maximizing the AR (RMax) and the other focused on minimizing inter-stream interference (IMin). To solve the RMax problem, we apply Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods to optimize the SIM phase shifts and power allocation alternately. For the IMin problem, we derive an efficient algorithm that iteratively updates each meta-atom's phase shift using a closed-form expression while keeping others fixed. Our key contribution is integrating these two approaches, where the IMin solution initializes the SIM phase shifts in the first algorithm. This hybrid strategy enhances AR performance across varying numbers of metasurface layers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform existing benchmarks. Most importantly, we show that increasing the number of metasurface layers while keeping the SIM thickness fixed leads to significant AR improvements.</description>

      <title>A Novel Comprehensive Multiport Network Model for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) Characterization and OptimizationA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are transformative technologies for next-generation wireless communication, offering advanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation. While RIS have been extensively studied, Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), which extend the RIS concept to multi-layered systems, present significant modeling and optimization challenges. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a new optimization framework for heterogeneous SIM architectures that, compared to previous approaches, is based on a comprehensive model without relying on specific assumptions, allowing for a broader applicability of the results. To this end, we first present a model based on multi-port network theory for characterizing a general electromagnetic collaborative object (ECO) and derive a general framework for ECO optimization. We then introduce the SIM as an ECO with a specific architecture and provide insights into SIM optimization for various architectures, discussing the complexity in each case. Next, we analyze the impact of commonly used assumptions, and as a further contribution, we propose a backpropagation algorithm for implementing the gradient descent method for a simplified SIM configuration.</description>

      <title>Modeling measurements for quantitative imaging subsurface targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ground-penetrating synthetic aperture radar measurements of scattering by targets located below a rough air-soil interface. By considering the inherent space/angle limitations of this imaging modality, we introduce a simplified model for measurements. This model assumes (i) first-order interactions between the target and the air-soil interface, (ii) scattering by the target below a flat air-soil interface, and (iii) a point target model. Using the method of fundamental solutions to simulate two-dimensional simulations of scalar waves for the direct scattering problem, we systematically study each of these data modeling assumptions. To test and validate these assumptions, we apply principal component analysis to approximately remove ground bounce signals from measurements and then apply Kirchhoff migration on that processed data to produce images. We show that images using this modeled data are nearly identical to those that use simulated measurements from the full direct scattering problem. In that way, we show that this model contains the essential information contained in measurements. Consequently, it provides a theoretical framework for understanding how inherent space/angle limitations affect subsurface imaging systems.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Unified Near-Field and Far-Field Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Type I and Type II codebooks in fifth generation (5G) wireless communications are limited in supporting the coexistence of far-field and near-field user equipments, as they are exclusively designed for far-field scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap and encourage relevant proposals by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), this article provides a novel codebook to facilitate a unified paradigm for the coexistence of far-field and near-field contexts. It ensures efficient precoding for all user equipments (UEs), while removing the need for the base station to identify whether one specific UE stays in either near-field or far-field regions. Additionally, our proposed codebook ensures compliance with current 3GPP standards for working flow and reference signals. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and versatility of our proposed codebook, validating its effectiveness in unifying near-field and far-field precoding for sixth-generation (6G) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.</description>

      <title>A Large-dimensional Analysis of ESPRIT DoA Estimation: Inconsistency and a Correction via RMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform asymptotic analyses of the widely used ESPRIT direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimator for large arrays, where the array size $N$ and the number of snapshots $T$ grow to infinity at the same pace. In this large-dimensional regime, the sample covariance matrix (SCM) is known to be a poor eigenspectral estimator of the population covariance. We show that the classical ESPRIT algorithm, that relies on the SCM, and as a consequence of the large-dimensional inconsistency of the SCM, produces inconsistent DoA estimates as $N,T \to \infty$ with $N/T \to c \in (0,\infty)$, for both widely- and closely-spaced DoAs. Leveraging tools from random matrix theory (RMT), we propose an improved G-ESPRIT method and prove its consistency in the same large-dimensional setting. From a technical perspective, we derive a novel bound on the eigenvalue differences between two potentially non-Hermitian random matrices, which may be of independent interest. Numerical simulations are provided to corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Pre-Processing Method for 6G Dynamic Ray-Tracing Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ray-tracing is often employed in urban areas for channel modeling with high accuracy but encounters a substantial computational complexity for high mobility scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-processing method for dynamic ray-tracing to reduce the computational burden in high-mobility scenarios by prepending the intersection judgment to the pre-processing stage. The proposed method generates an inter-visibility matrix that establishes visibility relationships among static objects in the environment considering the intersection judgment. Moreover, the inter-visibility matrix can be employed to create the inter-visibility table for mobile transmitters and receivers, which can improve the efficiency of constructing an image tree for the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic ray-tracing method. The results show that the proposed pre-processing method in dynamic ray-tracing has considerable time-saving compared with the traditional method while maintaining the same accuracy. The channel characteristics computed by the proposed method can well match to the channel measurements.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) improve connectivity between satellites in space. They offer advantages such as high-throughput data transfer and reduced size, weight, and power requirements compared to traditional radio frequency transmission. However, the channel model and communication performance for long-distance inter-satellite laser transmission still require in-depth study. In this paper, we first develop a channel model for OISL communication within non-terrestrial networks (NTN) by accounting for pointing errors caused by satellite jitter and tracking noise. We derive the distributions of the channel state arising from these pointing errors and calculate their average value. Additionally, we determine the average achievable data rate for OISL communication in NTN and design a cooperative OISL system, highlighting a trade-off between concentrating beam energy and balancing misalignment. We calculate the minimum number of satellites required in cooperative OISLs to achieve a targeted data transmission size while adhering to latency constraints. This involves exploring the balance between the increased data rate of each link and the cumulative latency across all links. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model and provide insights into the optimal number of satellites needed for cooperative OISLs and the optimal laser frequency to use.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Channel Estimation: Zone-Specific Subspace Prediction and Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective channel estimation in sparse and high-dimensional environments is essential for next-generation wireless systems, particularly in large-scale MIMO deployments. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages digital twins (DTs) as priors to enable efficient zone-specific subspace-based channel estimation (CE). Subspace-based CE significantly reduces feedback overhead by focusing on the dominant channel components, exploiting sparsity in the angular domain while preserving estimation accuracy. While DT channels may exhibit inaccuracies, their coarse-grained subspaces provide a powerful starting point, reducing the search space and accelerating convergence. The framework employs a two-step clustering process on the Grassmann manifold, combined with reinforcement learning (RL), to iteratively calibrate subspaces and align them with real-world counterparts. Simulations show that digital twins not only enable near-optimal performance but also enhance the accuracy of subspace calibration through RL, highlighting their potential as a step towards learnable digital twins.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided receiver for multi-target detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Furthermore, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum estimation of signal parameters by designing a rotational invariance based technique termed as RAQ-ESPRIT relying on our model. The proposed algorithm solves the sensor gain mismatch problem, which is due to the presence of the RF local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA and cannot be well addressed by using the conventional ESPRIT. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antennas: Reshaping Intrinsic Properties for Flexible Radiation Characteristics in Intelligent Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antennas present a relatively new idea for harnessing the fading and interference issues in multiple user wireless systems, such as 6G. Here, we systematically compare their unique radiation beam forming mechanism to the existing multiple-antenna systems in a wireless system. Subsequently, a unified mathematical model for fluid antennas is deduced based on the eigenmode theory. As mathematically derived from the multimode resonant theory, the spectral expansion model of any antennas which occupy variable spaces and have changeable feeding schemes can be generalized as fluid antennas. Non-liquid and liquid fluid antenna examples are presented, simulated and discussed. The symmetry or modal parity of eigenmodes is explored as an additional degree of freedom to design the fluid antennas for future wireless systems. As conceptually deduced and illustrated, the multi-dimensional and continuously adaptive ability of eigenmodes can be considered as the most fundamental intrinsic characteristic of the fluid antenna systems. It opens an uncharted area in the developments of intelligent antennas (IAs), which brings more flexibility to on-demand antenna beam null manipulating techniques for future wireless applications.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided near-field communication systems, where the extremely large number of RIS elements imposes considerable pilot overhead and computational complexity. To address this, we employ a two-timescale channel estimation strategy that exploits the asymmetric coherence times of the RIS-base station (BS) channel and the User-RIS channel. We derive a time-scaling property indicating that for any two effective channels within the longer coherence time, one effective channel can be represented as the product of a vector, referred to as the small-timescale effective channel, and the other effective channel. By utilizing the estimated effective channel along with processed observations from our piecewise beam training, we present an efficient method for estimating subsequent small-timescale effective channels. We theoretically establish the efficacy of the proposed RIS design and demonstrate, through simulations, the superiority of our channel estimation method in terms of pilot overhead and computational complexity compared to existing methods across various realistic channel models.</description>

      <title>Joint Secrecy Rate Achieving and Authentication Enhancement via Tag-based Encoding in Chaotic UAV Communication Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure communication is crucial in many emerging systems enabled by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks. To protect legitimate communication in a chaotic UAV environment, where both eavesdropping and jamming become straightforward from multiple adversaries with line-of-sight signal propagation, a new reliable and integrated physical layer security mechanism is proposed in this paper for a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) UAV system. Particularly, a physical layer fingerprint, also called a tag, is first embedded into each message for authentication purpose. We then propose to reuse the tag additionally as a reference to encode each message to ensure secrecy for confidentiality enhancement at a low cost. Specifically, we create a new dual-reference symmetric tag generation mechanism by inputting an encoding-insensitive feature of plaintext along with the key into a hash function. At a legitimate receiver, an expected tag, reliable for decoding, can be symmetrically regenerated based on the received ciphertext, and authentication can be performed by comparing the regenerated reference tag to the received tag. However, an illegitimate receiver can only receive the fuzzy tag which can not be used to decode the received message. Additionally, we introduce artificial noise (AN) to degrade eavesdropping to further decrease message leakage. To verify the efficiency of our proposed tag-based encoding (TBE) scheme, we formulate two optimization problems including ergodic sum secrecy rate maximization and authentication fail probability minimization. The power allocation solutions are derived by difference-of-convex (DC) programming and the Lagrange method, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TBE approach compared to the prior AN-aided tag embedding scheme.</description>

      <title>Communication Efficient Cooperative Edge AI via Event-Triggered Computation Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and require immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive nature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with designing edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems and techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from communication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to provide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for mission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered edge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing. Central to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which enables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading more complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To further enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive offloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the optimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The associated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original non-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural network classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification accuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to existing edge-inference approaches.</description>

      <title>Integrated Strategy for Urban Traffic Optimization: Prediction, Adaptive Signal Control, and Distributed Communication via Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an integrated approach to optimizing urban traffic by combining predictive modeling of vehicle flow, adaptive traffic signal control, and a modular integration architecture through distributed messaging. Using real-time data from various sensors, the system anticipates traffic fluctuations and dynamically adjusts signal phase durations to minimize delays and improve traffic flow. This proactive adjustment, supported by algorithms inspired by simulated annealing and reinforcement learning, also enhances energy efficiency, reduces pollutant emissions, and responds effectively to unexpected events (adverse weather, accidents, or temporary gatherings). Preliminary simulations conducted in a realistic urban environment demonstrate a significant reduction in average waiting times. Future developments include incorporating data from connected vehicles, integrating new modes of transport, and continuously refining predictive models to address the growing challenges of urban mobility.</description>

      <title>KANS: Knowledge Discovery Graph Attention Network for Soft Sensing in Multivariate Industrial Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft sensing of hard-to-measure variables is often crucial in industrial processes. Current practices rely heavily on conventional modeling techniques that show success in improving accuracy. However, they overlook the non-linear nature, dynamics characteristics, and non-Euclidean dependencies between complex process variables. To tackle these challenges, we present a framework known as a Knowledge discovery graph Attention Network for effective Soft sensing (KANS). Unlike the existing deep learning soft sensor models, KANS can discover the intrinsic correlations and irregular relationships between the multivariate industrial processes without a predefined topology. First, an unsupervised graph structure learning method is introduced, incorporating the cosine similarity between different sensor embedding to capture the correlations between sensors. Next, we present a graph attention-based representation learning that can compute the multivariate data parallelly to enhance the model in learning complex sensor nodes and edges. To fully explore KANS, knowledge discovery analysis has also been conducted to demonstrate the interpretability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that KANS significantly outperforms all the baselines and state-of-the-art methods in soft sensing performance. Furthermore, the analysis shows that KANS can find sensors closely related to different process variables without domain knowledge, significantly improving soft sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>ST-HCSS: Deep Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Convolutional Neural Network for Soft Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order sensor networks are more accurate in characterizing the nonlinear dynamics of sensory time-series data in modern industrial settings by allowing multi-node connections beyond simple pairwise graph edges. In light of this, we propose a deep spatio-temporal hypergraph convolutional neural network for soft sensing (ST-HCSS). In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes. Our results validate the superiority of ST-HCSS compared to existing state-of-the-art soft sensors, and demonstrates that the learned hypergraph feature representations aligns well with the sensor data correlations.

      <title>Securing Integrated Sensing and Communication Against a Mobile Adversary: A Stackelberg Game with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system employing a full-duplex base station with sensing capabilities against a mobile proactive adversarial target$\unicode{x2014}$a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (M-UAV). We develop a game-theoretic model to enhance communication security, radar sensing accuracy, and power efficiency. The interaction between the legitimate network and the mobile adversary is formulated as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game (NSG), where the M-UAV acts as the leader and strategically adjusts its trajectory to improve its eavesdropping ability while conserving power and avoiding obstacles. In response, the legitimate network, acting as the follower, dynamically allocates resources to minimize network power usage while ensuring required secrecy rates and sensing performance. To address this challenging problem, we propose a low-complexity successive convex approximation (SCA) method for network resource optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for adaptive M-UAV trajectory planning through sequential interactions and learning. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in addressing security challenges of dynamic ISAC systems in 6G, i.e., achieving a Stackelberg equilibrium with robust performance while mitigating the adversary's ability to intercept network signals.</description>

      <title>Design and Benchmarking of A Multi-Modality Sensor for Robotic Manipulation with GAN-Based Cross-Modality Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and benchmark of an innovative sensor, ViTacTip, which fulfills the demand for advanced multi-modal sensing in a compact design. A notable feature of ViTacTip is its transparent skin, which incorporates a `see-through-skin' mechanism. This mechanism aims at capturing detailed object features upon contact, significantly improving both vision-based and proximity perception capabilities. In parallel, the biomimetic tips embedded in the sensor's skin are designed to amplify contact details, thus substantially augmenting tactile and derived force perception abilities. To demonstrate the multi-modal capabilities of ViTacTip, we developed a multi-task learning model that enables simultaneous recognition of hardness, material, and textures. To assess the functionality and validate the versatility of ViTacTip, we conducted extensive benchmarking experiments, including object recognition, contact point detection, pose regression, and grating identification. To facilitate seamless switching between various sensing modalities, we employed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach. This method enhances the applicability of the ViTacTip sensor across diverse environments by enabling cross-modality interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable uplink connectivity remains a persistent challenge for IoT devices, particularly those at the cell edge, due to their limited transmit power and single-antenna configurations. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at connecting the unconnectable, leveraging real-time feedback from access points (APs) to enhance uplink coverage without increasing the energy consumption of IoT devices. At the core of this approach are feedback channel codes, which enable IoT devices to dynamically adapt their transmission strategies based on AP decoding feedback, thereby reducing the critical uplink SNR required for successful communication. Analytical models are developed to quantify the coverage probability and the number of connectable APs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Numerical results validate the proposed method, demonstrating substantial improvements in coverage range and connectivity, particularly for devices at the cell edge, with up to a 51% boost in connectable APs. Our approach offers a robust and energy-efficient solution to overcoming uplink coverage limitations, enabling IoT networks to connect devices in challenging environments.</description>

Abstract: Gradient descent is the method of choice for training large artificial intelligence systems. As these systems become larger, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind gradient training would allow us to alleviate compute costs and help steer these systems away from harmful behaviors. To that end, we suggest utilizing the circuit perspective brought forward by mechanistic interpretability. After laying out our intuition, we illustrate how it enables us to design a curriculum for efficient learning in a controlled setting.

      <title>Blockage-Aware UAV-Assisted Wireless Data Harvesting With Building Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer dynamic trajectory control, enabling them to avoid obstacles and establish line-of-sight (LoS) wireless channels with ground nodes (GNs), unlike traditional ground-fixed base stations. This study addresses the joint optimization of scheduling and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory planning for UAV-assisted wireless data harvesting. The objective is to maximize the minimum uplink throughput among GNs while accounting for signal blockages and building avoidance. To achieve this, we first present mathematical models designed to avoid cuboid-shaped buildings and to determine wireless signal blockage by buildings through rigorous mathematical proof. The optimization problem is formulated as nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming and solved using advanced techniques. Specifically, the problem is decomposed into convex subproblems via quadratic transform and successive convex approximation. Building avoidance and signal blockage constraints are incorporated using the separating hyperplane method and an approximated indicator function. These subproblems are then iteratively solved using the block coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The UAV dynamically adjusts its trajectory and scheduling policy to maintain LoS channels with GNs, significantly enhancing network throughput compared to existing schemes. Moreover, the trajectory of the UAV adheres to building avoidance constraints for its continuous trajectory, ensuring uninterrupted operation and compliance with safety requirements.</description>

      <title>Neural Reflectance Fields for Radio-Frequency Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ray tracing is widely employed to model the propagation of radio-frequency (RF) signal in complex environment. The modelling performance greatly depends on how accurately the target scene can be depicted, including the scene geometry and surface material properties. The advances in computer vision and LiDAR make scene geometry estimation increasingly accurate, but there still lacks scalable and efficient approaches to estimate the material reflectivity in real-world environment. In this work, we tackle this problem by learning the material reflectivity efficiently from the path loss of the RF signal from the transmitters to receivers. Specifically, we want the learned material reflection coefficients to minimize the gap between the predicted and measured powers of the receivers. We achieve this by translating the neural reflectance field from optics to RF domain by modelling both the amplitude and phase of RF signals to account for the multipath effects. We further propose a differentiable RF ray tracing framework that optimizes the neural reflectance field to match the signal strength measurements. We simulate a complex real-world environment for experiments and our simulation results show that the neural reflectance field can successfully learn the reflection coefficients for all incident angles. As a result, our approach achieves better accuracy in predicting the powers of receivers with significantly less training data compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) and movable antenna (MA) have recently emerged as promising technologies to exploit new degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the spatial domain, which have attracted growing attention in wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna independently by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we investigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs at the base station (BS) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles of RAs are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the BS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of antennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system can achieve a higher array gain as compared to the fixed-antenna system. In the general multi-user and multi-path channel setup, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage algorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is further proposed to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed RA system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in 6G Space-Ground Integrated Networks: A Ground Protection Zone-Based Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-ground integrated network (SGIN) has been envisioned as a competitive solution for large scale and wide coverage of future wireless networks. By integrating both the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and the terrestrial network (TN), SGIN can provide high speed and omnipresent wireless network access for the users using the predefined licensed spectrums. Considering the scarcity of the spectrum resource and the low spectrum efficiency of the SGIN, we enable the NTN and TN to share the spectrum to improve overall system performance, i.e., weighted-sum area data rate (WS-ADR). However, mutual interference between NTN and TN is often inevitable and thus causes SGIN performance degradation. In this work, we consider a ground protection zone for the TN base stations, in which the NTN users are only allowed to use the NTN reserved spectrum to mitigate the NTN and TN mutual interference. We analytically derive the coverage probability and area data rate (ADR) of the typical users and study the performance under various protection zone sizes and spectrum allocation parameter settings. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate that the WS-ADR could be maximized by selecting the appropriate radius of protection zone and bandwidth allocation factor in the SGIN.</description>

      <title>MSA-CNN: A Lightweight Multi-Scale CNN with Attention for Sleep Stage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning-based signal analysis, coupled with open data initiatives, have fuelled efforts in automatic sleep stage classification. Despite the proliferation of classification models, few have prioritised reducing model complexity, which is a crucial factor for practical applications. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale and Attention Convolutional Neural Network (MSA-CNN), a lightweight architecture featuring as few as ~10,000 parameters. MSA-CNN leverages a novel multi-scale module employing complementary pooling to eliminate redundant filter parameters and dense convolutions. Model complexity is further reduced by separating temporal and spatial feature extraction and using cost-effective global spatial convolutions. This separation of tasks not only reduces model complexity but also mirrors the approach used by human experts in sleep stage scoring. We evaluated both small and large configurations of MSA-CNN against nine state-of-the-art baseline models across three public datasets, treating univariate and multivariate models separately. Our evaluation, based on repeated cross-validation and re-evaluation of all baseline models, demonstrated that the large MSA-CNN outperformed all baseline models on all three datasets in terms of accuracy and Cohen's kappa, despite its significantly reduced parameter count. Lastly, we explored various model variants and conducted an in-depth analysis of the key modules and techniques, providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. The code for our models, baselines, and evaluation procedures is available at https://github.com/sgoerttler/MSA-CNN.</description>

      <title>Online Collaborative Resource Allocation and Task Offloading for Multi-access Edge Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide flexible computing services close to user devices (UDs). However, meeting the computation-hungry and delay-sensitive demands of UDs faces several challenges, including the resource constraints of MEC servers, inherent dynamic and complex features in the MEC system, and difficulty in dealing with the time-coupled and decision-coupled optimization. In this work, we first present an edge-cloud collaborative MEC architecture, where the MEC servers and cloud collaboratively provide offloading services for UDs. Moreover, we formulate an energy-efficient and delay-aware optimization problem (EEDAOP) to minimize the energy consumption of UDs under the constraints of task deadlines and long-term queuing delays. Since the problem is proved to be non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose an online joint communication resource allocation and task offloading approach (OJCTA). Specifically, we transform EEDAOP into a real-time optimization problem by employing the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, to solve the real-time optimization problem, we propose a communication resource allocation and task offloading optimization method by employing the Tammer decomposition mechanism, convex optimization method, bilateral matching mechanism, and dependent rounding method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OJCTA can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning strategies allow a collection of agents to learn efficiently from local data sets without the need for central aggregation or orchestration. Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.</description>

Abstract: This letter introduces a low-complexity beamforming approach for MU-MIMO systems with multiple data streams per user, minimizing inter-user interference and improving spectral efficiency (SE). The Interference-Optimized Singular Vector Beamforming (IOSVB) algorithm is developed by correlating inter-user interference with channel singular vectors. It blends interference minimization and SE maximization by identifying ideal singular vectors. Extensive simulations demonstrate that IOSVB provides near-optimal SE performance, closely matching exhaustive search results while reducing the computational overhead. This novel approach in MU-MIMO systems is a promising option for future 6G wireless communication networks due to its excellent performance and reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Array Synthesis in Terms of Characteristic Modes and Generalized Scattering Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02046v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of antenna arrays in presence of mutual coupling using generalized scattering matrices in terms of characteristic modes is proposed. For the synthesis, the array is built of synthetic elements that are described by their modal scattering and radiation behavior. In particular, the question of how to describe the degrees of freedom of such elements is addressed. The eigenvalues of the characteristic modes of the element geometry and the modal radiation behavior of the antenna are thereby selected as degrees of freedom for the model of the synthetic elements. Using this model and a modal coupling matrix, an approach to optimize the modal configuration of the elements within an array is proposed. Finally, a close to reality example shows how the proposed theory can be used to enhance the cross-polarization rejection of a circularly polarized patch antenna array with a fixed beam.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Movable-Antenna MIMO Systems Via Tensor Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the channel estimation problem for MIMO wireless communication systems with movable antennas (MAs) at both the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). To achieve high channel estimation accuracy with low pilot training overhead, we propose a tensor decomposition-based method for estimating the parameters of multi-path channel components, including their azimuth and elevation angles, as well as complex gain coefficients, thereby reconstructing the wireless channel between any pair of Tx and Rx MA positions in the Tx and Rx regions. First, we introduce a two-stage Tx-Rx successive antenna movement pattern for pilot training, such that the received pilot signals in both stages can be expressed as a third-order tensor. Then, we obtain the factor matrices of the tensor via the canonical polyadic decomposition, and thereby estimate the angle/gain parameters for enabling the channel reconstruction between arbitrary Tx/Rx MA positions. In addition, we analyze the uniqueness condition of the tensor decomposition, which ensures the complete channel reconstruction between the whole Tx and Rx regions based on the channel measurements at only a finite number of Tx/Rx MA positions. Finally, simulation results are presented to evaluate the proposed tensor decomposition-based method as compared to existing methods, in terms of channel estimation accuracy and pilot overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After nearly a century of specialized applications in optics, remote sensing, and acoustics, the near-field (NF) electromagnetic propagation zone is experiencing a resurgence in research interest. This renewed attention is fueled by the emergence of promising applications in various fields such as wireless communications, holography, medical imaging, and quantum-inspired systems. Signal processing within NF sensing and wireless communications environments entails addressing issues related to extended scatterers, range-dependent beampatterns, spherical wavefronts, mutual coupling effects, and the presence of both reactive and radiative fields. Recent investigations have focused on these aspects in the context of extremely large arrays and wide bandwidths, giving rise to novel challenges in channel estimation, beamforming, beam training, sensing, and localization. While NF optics has a longstanding history, advancements in NF phase retrieval techniques and their applications have lately garnered significant research attention. Similarly, utilizing NF localization with acoustic arrays represents a contemporary extension of established principles in NF acoustic array signal processing. This article aims to provide an overview of state-of-the-art signal processing techniques within the NF domain, offering a comprehensive perspective on recent advances in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>A Homogeneous Graph Neural Network for Precoding and Power Allocation in Scalable Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning is widely used in wireless communications but struggles with fixed neural network sizes, which limit their adaptability in environments where the number of users and antennas varies. To overcome this, this paper introduced a generalization strategy for precoding and power allocation in scalable wireless networks. Initially, we employ an innovative approach to abstract the wireless network into a homogeneous graph. This primarily focuses on bypassing the heterogeneous features between transmitter (TX) and user entities to construct a virtual homogeneous graph serving optimization objectives, thereby enabling all nodes in the virtual graph to share the same neural network. This ``TX entity'' is known as a base station (BS) in cellular networks and an access point (AP) in cell-free networks. Subsequently, we design a universal graph neural network, termed the information carrying graph neural network (ICGNN), to capture and integrate information from this graph, maintaining permutation invariance. Lastly, using ICGNN as the core algorithm, we tailor the neural network's input and output for specific problem requirements and validate its performance in two scenarios: 1) in cellular networks, we develop a matrix-inverse-free multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) precoding scheme using the conjugate gradient (CG) method, adaptable to varying user and antenna numbers; 2) in a cell-free network, facing dynamic variations in the number of users served by APs, the number of APs serving each user, and the number of antennas per AP, we propose a universal power allocation scheme. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach not only significantly reduces computational complexity but also achieves, and potentially exceeds, the spectral efficiency (SE) of conventional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sensing and Mitigation of Multi-Scatterer Self-Interference for Full-Duplex MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes the joint use of digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC) and spatial suppression to mitigate far-field self-interference (SI) in full-duplex multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Far-field SI, caused by echoes from environmental scatterers, is modeled based on the scatterers' angle and delay parameters, stored in a scatterer map. For each scatterer, the most suitable action regarding communication is selected from transmit beamforming, receive beamforming, DSIC, and no-action. This selection is based on simple metrics that show the expected uplink and downlink communication performance. In addition, emerging scatterers that deteriorate the communication are detected, and their delay and angles are acquired, providing an up-to-date scatterer map and presenting a \emph{sensing for communication} case. The proposed selection policy is compared with the individual implementations of DSIC and spatial suppression, highlighting the failure cases for each. It is shown that the proposed policy stays unaffected in these problematic cases and achieves SI-free performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aperiodic autocorrelation is an important indicator of performance of sequences used in communications, remote sensing, and scientific instrumentation. Knowing a sequence's autocorrelation function, which reports the autocorrelation at every possible translation, is equivalent to knowing the magnitude of the sequence's Fourier transform. The phase problem is the difficulty in resolving this lack of phase information. We say that two sequences are equicorrelational to mean that they have the same aperiodic autocorrelation function. Sequences used in technological applications often have restrictions on their terms: they are not arbitrary complex numbers, but come from a more restricted alphabet. For example, binary sequences involve terms equal to only $+1$ and $-1$. We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be equicorrelational, where we take their alphabet into consideration. There are trivial forms of equicorrelationality arising from modifications that predictably preserve the autocorrelation, for example, negating a binary sequence or reversing the order of its terms. By a search of binary sequences up to length $44$, we find that nontrivial equicorrelationality among binary sequences does occur, but is rare. An integer $n$ is said to be equivocal when there are binary sequences of length $n$ that are nontrivially equicorrelational; otherwise $n$ is unequivocal. For $n \leq 44$, we found that the unequivocal lengths are $1$--$8$, $10$, $11$, $13$, $14$, $19$, $22$, $23$, $26$, $29$, $37$, and $38$. We pose open questions about the finitude of unequivocal numbers and the probability of nontrivial equicorrelationality occurring among binary sequences.</description>

Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is a novel technology which enables the full-space coverage. In this letter, a multi-active STAR-RIS-aided system using non-orthogonal multiple access in an uplink transmission is considered, where the second-order reflections among multiple active STAR-RISs assist the transmission from the single-antenna users to the multi-antenna base station. Specifically, the total sum rate maximization problem is solved by jointly optimizing the active beamforming, power allocation, transmission and reflection beamforming at the active STAR-RISs, and user-active STAR-RIS assignment. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed which integrates Meta-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), denoted by Meta-DDPG. Numerical results reveal that our proposed Meta-DDPG algorithm outperforms the DDPG algorithm with $19\%$ improvement, while second-order reflections among multi-active STAR-RISs provide $74.1\%$ enhancement in the total data rate.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Flow-based Differentiable Particle Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01499</link>

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in incorporating neural networks into particle filters, e.g. differentiable particle filters, to perform joint sequential state estimation and model learning for non-linear non-Gaussian state-space models in complex environments. Existing differentiable particle filters are mostly constructed with vanilla neural networks that do not allow density estimation. As a result, they are either restricted to a bootstrap particle filtering framework or employ predefined distribution families (e.g. Gaussian distributions), limiting their performance in more complex real-world scenarios. In this paper we present a differentiable particle filtering framework that uses (conditional) normalizing flows to build its dynamic model, proposal distribution, and measurement model. This not only enables valid probability densities but also allows the proposed method to adaptively learn these modules in a flexible way, without being restricted to predefined distribution families. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed filters and evaluate the proposed normalizing flow-based differentiable particle filters' performance through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Hybrid Precoding in Millimeter Wave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hybrid analog/digital architecture that connects a limited number of RF chains to multiple antennas through phase shifters could effectively address the energy consumption issues in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the main challenges in hybrid precoding lie in the coupling between analog and digital precoders and the constant modulus constraint. Generally, traditional optimization algorithms for this problem typically suffer from high computational complexity or suboptimal performance, while deep learning based solutions exhibit poor scalability and robustness. This paper proposes a plug and play, free of pre-training solution that leverages gradient guided meta learning (GGML) framework to maximize the spectral efficiency of MIMO systems through hybrid precoding. Specifically, GGML utilizes gradient information as network input to facilitate the sharing of gradient information flow. We retain the iterative process of traditional algorithms and leverage meta learning to alternately optimize the precoder. Simulation results show that this method outperforms existing methods, demonstrates robustness to variations in system parameters, and can even exceed the performance of fully digital weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) precoding with the same number of antennas.</description>

      <title>AI-powered Digital Twin of the Ocean: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Real-time Wave Height Prediction with Deep Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion have prompted the need for renewable energy-based power generation. However, its stability is often challenged by low energy density and non-stationary conditions. Wave energy converters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height prediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can lead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we propose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with deep ensemble (DE) for robust uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To further enhance the reliability, uncertainty calibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality of the quantified uncertainty. Using real operational data from an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, the model achieves notable accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.9), while increasing uncertainty quality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model hyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational scenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period. These results demonstrate the model's capability to deliver reliable predictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.</description>

Abstract: With the growing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) communication networks has emerged as a transformative paradigm. By embedding AI capabilities across various network layers, this integration enables optimized resource allocation, improved efficiency, and enhanced system robust performance, particularly in intricate and dynamic environments. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, with a focus on emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We first review the integration of AI and communications in the context of 6G, exploring the driving factors behind incorporating AI into wireless communications, as well as the vision for the convergence of AI and 6G. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The first stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The second stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, such as digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services, supporting application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the critical challenges faced by the integration of AI and communications in 6G. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that are expected to drive the development and refinement of AI and 6G communications.</description>

      <title>Joint Task Offloading and Routing in Wireless Multi-hop Networks Using Biased Backpressure Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge for computation offloading in wireless multi-hop networks is the complex interaction among traffic flows in the presence of interference. Existing approaches often ignore these key effects and/or rely on outdated queueing and channel state information. To fill these gaps, we reformulate joint offloading and routing as a routing problem on an extended graph with physical and virtual links. We adopt the state-of-the-art shortest path-biased Backpressure routing algorithm, which allows the destination and the route of a job to be dynamically adjusted at every time step based on network-wide long-term information and real-time states of local neighborhoods. In large networks, our approach achieves smaller makespan than existing approaches, such as separated Backpressure offloading and joint offloading and routing based on linear programming.</description>
