      <title>Scaling the human niche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human niche represents the intersection of biological, ecological, cultural, and technological processes that have co-evolved to shape human adaptation and societal complexity. This paper explores the human niche through the lens of macroecological scaling theory, seeking to define and quantify the dimensions along which human ecological strategies have diversified. By leveraging concepts from classic niche theory, niche construction, and complex adaptive systems, I develop a framework for understanding human ecology as both predictable within mammalian scaling relationships and uniquely divergent due to social, cognitive, and technological factors. Key dimensions of the human niche-metabolism, cognition, sociality, and computation-are examined through scaling laws that structure human interactions with the environment and each other. The paper demonstrates how human niche expansion over evolutionary time has been characterized by increasing metabolic consumption, information processing capacity, and the formation of larger, more interconnected social networks. This cumulative trajectory has led to the unprecedented scale of contemporary human societies, with implications for sustainability, economic development, and future niche expansion, including into space. The study underscores the need for an integrative, quantitative approach to human ecology that situates human adaptability within broader ecological and evolutionary constraints.</description>

      <title>Evolution of boundedly rational learning in games</title>

Abstract: People make strategic decisions multiple times a day. We act strategically in negotiations, when we coordinate our actions with others, or when we choose with whom to cooperate. The resulting dynamics can be studied with evolutionary game theory. This framework explores how people adapt their decisions over time, in light of how effective their strategies have proven to be. A crucial quantity in respective models is the strength of selection. This quantity regulates how likely individuals switch to a better strategy when given the choice. The larger the selection strength, the more biased is the learning process in favor of strategies with large payoffs. Therefore, this quantity is often interpreted as a measure of rationality. Traditionally, most models take selection strength to be a fixed parameter. Instead, here we allow the individuals' strategies and their selection strength to co-evolve. The endpoints of this co-evolutionary process depend on the strategic interaction in place. In many prisoner's dilemmas, selection strength increases indefinitely, as one may expect. However, in snowdrift or stag-hunt games, it can either converge to a finite value, or we observe evolutionary branching altogether - such that different individuals arrive at different selection strengths. Overall, this work sheds light on how evolution might shape learning mechanisms for social behavior. It suggests that boundedly rational learning is not only a by-product of cognitive constraints. Instead it might also evolve as a means to gain strategic advantages.</description>

      <title>Balancing the cellular budget: lessons in metabolism from microbes to cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer cells are often seen to prefer glycolytic metabolism over oxidative phosphorylation even in the presence of oxygen-a phenomenon termed the Warburg effect. Despite significant strides in the decades since its discovery, a clear basis is yet to be established for the Warburg effect and why cancer cells show such a preference for aerobic glycolysis. In this review, we draw on what is known about similar metabolic shifts both in normal mammalian physiology and overflow metabolism in microbes to shed new light on whether aerobic glycolysis in cancer represents some form of optimisation of cellular metabolism. From microbes to cancer, we find that metabolic shifts favouring glycolysis are sometimes driven by the need for faster growth, but the growth rate is by no means a universal goal of optimal metabolism. Instead, optimisation goals at the cellular level are often multi-faceted and any given metabolic state must be considered in the context of both its energetic costs and benefits over a range of environmental contexts. For this purpose, we identify the conceptual framework of resource allocation as a potential testbed for the investigation of the cost-benefit balance of cellular metabolic strategies. Such a framework is also readily integrated with dynamical systems modelling, making it a promising avenue for new answers to the age-old question of why cells, from cancers to microbes, choose the metabolic strategies they do.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector-Based Sensitivity Analysis of Contact Patterns in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how age-specific social contact patterns and susceptibility influence infectious disease transmission is crucial for accurate epidemic modeling. This study presents an eigenvector-based sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the impact of age-structured interactions on disease spread. By applying perturbation analysis to the Next Generation Matrix, we reformulate the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, as a generalized eigenproblem, enabling the identification of key age group interactions that drive transmission. Using real-world COVID-19 contact data from Hungary, we demonstrate the framework's ability to highlight critical transmission pathways. We compare these findings with results obtained earlier using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we extend the analysis to contact structures in the UK and British Columbia, Canada, providing broader epidemiological insights. This work enhances our understanding of demographic interactions in epidemic propagation and offers a robust methodological foundation for improving infectious disease modeling and informing public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Structural causal influence (SCI) captures the forces of social inequality in models of disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling has played a central role in understanding how infectious disease transmission manifests in populations. These models have demonstrated the importance of key community-level factors in structuring epidemic risk, and are now routinely used in public health for decision support. One barrier to their broader utility is that the existing canon does not often accommodate social inequalities as distinct formal drivers of variability in transmission dynamics. Given decades of evidence supporting the organizational effects of inequalities in structuring society more generally, and infectious disease risk more specifically, addressing this modeling gap is of critical importance. In this study, we build on previous efforts to integrate social forces into computational epidemiology by introducing a metric, the structural causal influence (SCI). The SCI uses causal analysis to provide a measure of the relative vulnerability of sub-communities within a susceptible population, shaped by differences in characteristics such as access to therapy, exposure to disease, and other determinants driven by social forces. We develop our metric in a simple case and apply it to a context of public health importance: Hepatitis C virus in a population of persons who inject drugs. In addition, we demonstrate the flexibility of the SCI using an agent-based model of an infectious disease. Our use of the SCI reveals that, under specific parameters in a multi-community model, the "less vulnerable" community may achieve a basic reproduction number below one, ensuring disease extinction. However, even minimal transmission between communities can increase this number, leading to sustained epidemics within both communities.</description>
