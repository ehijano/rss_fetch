      <title>A mechanism for ice growth on the surface of a spherical water droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and growth of ice particles, particularly on the surfaces of spherical water droplets, bear profound implications for localized weather systems and global climate. Herein, we develop a theoretical framework for ice nucleation on minuscule water droplets, establishing that $10\sim5000\rm\ nm$ droplets can considerably increase in volume, making a substantial contribution to ice formation within mist, fog, or even cloud systems. We reveal that the Casimir-Lifshitz (van der Waals) interaction within these systems is robust enough to stimulate both water and ice growth on the surfaces of ice-cold spherical water droplets. The significant impacts and possible detectable phenomena from the curvature are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Compositionally Grading Alloy Stacking Fault Energy using Autonomous Path Planning and Additive Manufacturing with Elemental Powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionally graded alloys (CGAs) are often proposed for use in structural components where the combination of two or more alloys within a single part can yield substantial enhancement in performance and functionality. For these applications, numerous design methodologies have been developed, one of the most sophisticated being the application of path planning algorithms originally designed for robotics to solve CGA design problems. In addition to the traditional application to structural components, this work proposes and demonstrates the application of this CGA design framework to rapid alloy design, synthesis, and characterization. A composition gradient in the CoCrFeNi alloy space was planned between the maximum and minimum stacking fault energy (SFE) as predicted by a previously developed model in a face-centered cubic (FCC) high entropy alloy (HEA) space. The path was designed to be monotonic in SFE and avoid regions that did not meet FCC phase fraction and solidification range constraints predicted by CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD). Compositions from the path were selected to produce a linear gradient in SFE, and the CGA was built using laser directed energy deposition (L-DED). The resulting gradient was characterized for microstructure and mechanical properties, including hardness, elastic modulus, and strain rate sensitivity. Despite being predicted to contain a single FCC phase throughout the gradient, part of the CGA underwent a martensitic transformation, thereby demonstrating a limitation of using equilibrium CALPHAD calculations for phase stability predictions. More broadly, this demonstrates the ability of the methods employed to bring attention to blind spots in alloy models.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Fatigue Strength Prediction via Additive Manufactured Functionally Graded Materials and High-Throughput Plasticity Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent improvements in additive manufacturing and high-throughput material synthesis have enabled the discovery of novel metallic materials for extreme environments. However, high-fidelity testing of advanced mechanical properties such as fatigue strength, has often been the most time-consuming and resource-intensive step of material discovery, thereby slowing down the adoption of novel materials. This work presents a new method for rapid characterization of the fatigue properties of many compositions while only testing a single specimen. The approach utilizes high-resolution digital image correlation along with a computer vision model to extract the relationship between localized plastic deformation events and associated mechanical properties. The approach is initially validated on an additive manufactured 316L dataset, then applied to a functionally graded additive manufactured specimen with a composition gradient across the gauge length. This allows for the characterization of multiple compositions, orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Cove-edged Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons with Chirality-Dependent Bandgap and Carrier Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have garnered significant interest due to their highly customizable physicochemical properties and potential utility in nanoelectronics. Besides controlling widths and edge structures, the inclusion of chirality in GNRs brings another dimension for fine-tuning their optoelectronic properties, but related studies remain elusive owing to the absence of feasible synthetic strategies. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of cove-edged chiral GNRs (CcGNRs) with a tunable chiral vector (n,m). Notably, the bandgap and effective mass of (n,2)- CcGNR show a distinct positive correlation with the increasing value of n, as indicated by theory. Within this GNR family, two representative members, namely, (4,2)- CcGNR and (6,2)-CcGNR, are successfully synthesized. Both CcGNRs exhibit prominently curved geometries arising from the incorporated [4]helicene motifs along their peripheries, as also evidenced by the single-crystal structures of the two respective model compounds (1 and 2). The chemical identities and optoelectronic properties of (4,2)- and (6,2)-CcGNRs are comprehensively investigated via a combination of IR, Raman, solid-state NMR, UV-vis, and THz spectroscopies as well as theoretical calculations. In line with theoretical expectation, the obtained (6,2)-CcGNR possesses a low optical bandgap of 1.37 eV along with charge carrier mobility of 8 cm2/Vs, whereas (4,2)-CcGNR exhibits a narrower bandgap of 1.26 eV with increased mobility of 14 cm2/Vs. This work opens up a new avenue to precisely engineer the bandgap and carrier mobility of GNRs by manipulating their chiral vector.</description>

      <title>Probing Structural Dynamics in Photocatalytic Water Splitting: X-ray vs. Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting represents a pivotal pathway for converting solar energy into chemical energy, with the core challenge lying in the design and optimization of photocatalysts [1] . TiO2, as a quintessential photocatalytic material, undergoes significant alterations in its electronic and crystalline structures under intense light irradiation, which may directly impacts its photocatalytic efficiency [2] . To gain a profound understanding of these transformations, in situ characterization techniques such as X-ray scattering and neutron scattering have emerged as crucial tools. This paper, from a combined perspective of theoretical computation and experimental characterization, explores the differential capabilities of X-ray scattering and neutron scattering in characterizing the pair distribution function (PDF) of materials during photocatalytic water splitting. Furthermore, through simulation calculations, it aims to unveil the changes in the electronic and crystalline structures under intense light irradiation. This initial draft of the paper is subject to subsequent revisions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Water Contamination on the Aging of a Dual-Carbon Lithium-Ion Capacitor Employing LiFSI-Based Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabricating electrochemical energy storage devices demands significant energy for drying cell components to ensure optimal performance. The development of new, water-tolerant materials would represent a tremendous advance in cost savings and sustainability. Although it is generally established that water deteriorates cell performance, there are few systematic studies on the maximum amount of tolerable water contamination, and most of the studies employed the electrolyte salt $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$, which inevitably decomposes upon exposure to humidity. In this work, the potential of using the non-hydrolyzing salt LiFSI is explored with respect to its performance in Li-ion capacitor cells based on activated carbon (AC) and pre-lithiated graphite (Gr). Water is deliberately added in various amounts (950, 2300, and 6000 ppm), and its effect on the electrochemical performance and aging of AC and Gr electrodes is systematically studied. While the addition of 950 ppm water has no evident impact on capacity retention (96% after 2000 cycles), the addition of 2300 ppm water or 6000 ppm water shows a distinct capacity fade, attributed to a significant loss of lithium inventory and increased resistivity due to irreversible reactions of the water with lithiated Gr. Post-mortem analysis reveals that water promotes the oxidative and reductive decomposition of LiFSI on AC and lithiated Gr, respectively. A significant thickening of the SEI on Gr is observed as the water concentration is increased.</description>

      <title>Giant Topological Hall Effect Across Wide Temperature in Pt/NiCo2O4 Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Hall effect (THE), a quantum phenomenon arising from emergent magnetic field generated by topological spin texture, is a key method for detecting non-coplanar spin structures like skyrmions in magnetic materials. Here, we investigate a bilayer structure of Pt and conducting ferrimagnet NiCo2O4 (NCO) of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate giant THE across a temperature range 2 - 350 K. The absence of THE in single-layer Pt and NCO, as well as in Pt/Cu/NCO, suggests its interfacial origin. The maximum THE occurring just before the NCO coercive field indicates its connection to magnetic nucleation centers, which are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. The large normalized THE, based on the emergent-field model, points to a high population density of small nucleation centers. This aligns with the unresolvable domain structures during magnetization reversal, even though clear domain structures are detected after zero-field cooling. These results establish heavy metal/NCO as a promising system for exploring topological spin structures.</description>

      <title>Carbon in GaN as a nonradiative recombination center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trap-assisted nonradiative recombination has been shown to limit the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. While substitutional carbon ($\mathrm{C_N}$) has been suggested to be a nonradiative recombination center in GaN devices, a complete recombination cycle including the two charge-state transition levels has not been previously described. In this work, we investigate the trap-assisted recombination process due to $\mathrm{C_N}$ in GaN, including multiphonon emission (MPE), radiative recombination, trap-assisted Auger-Meitner (TAAM) recombination, as well as thermal emission of holes. Our study shows the key role of TAAM processes at the high carrier densities relevant for devices. We also reveal the carrier-density regimes where thermal emission and radiative recombination are expected to play an observable role. Our results highlight that carbon concentrations exceeding $\sim$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ can have a noticeable impact on device efficiency, not just in GaN active layers but also in InGaN and AlGaN. Our comprehensive formalism not only offers detailed results for carbon but provides a general framework for assessing the multiple processes that participate in trap-assisted recombination in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Bright hybrid excitons in molecularly tunable bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, built by stacking crystalline monolayers, generate interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by fixed covalent lattices and orientations. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as diverse functional groups enable tunable molecular lattices and interlayer potentials, tailoring a wide range of excitonic properties. Here, we report hybrid excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), directly synthesized with single-crystalline perylene diimide (PDI) molecular crystal atop WS2 monolayers. These excitons arise from a hybridized bilayer band structure, revealed by lattice-scale first-principles calculations, inheriting properties from both monolayers. They exhibit bright photoluminescence with near-unity polarization above and below the WS2 bandgap, along with spectral signatures of exciton delocalization, supported by theory, while their energies and intensities are tuned by modifying the HBC composition by synthesis. Our work introduces a molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform for bottom-up design and control of optoelectronic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic insulating garnet films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) are of great importance for the applications in spintronics. Tm3Fe5O12 (TmIG) with magnetoelastic anisotropy has been proven to exhibit PMA more easily than Y3Fe5O12. Here, magnetic parameters of TmIG films with various thicknesses are investigated by ferromagnetic resonance. The relationship between effective magnetic magnetization, surface perpendicular anisotropy field, magnetic anisotropy constants and film thickness is established. The parameters of spin Hall angle, spin diffusion length, and real part of the spin mixing conductance are obtained from the measurements of angular dependent magnetoresistance of TmIG/Pt heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Self-ion irradiation effects on nanoindentation-induced plasticity of crystalline iron: A joint experimental and computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, experimental work is supported by multi-scale numerical modeling to investigate nanomechanical response of pristine and ion irradiated with Fe2+ ions with energy 5 MeV high purity iron specimens by nanoindentation and Electron Backscatter Diffraction. The appearance of a sudden displacement burst that is observed during the loading process in the load-displacement curves is connected with increased shear stress in a small subsurface volume due to dislocation slip activation and mobilization of pre-existing dislocations by irradiation. The molecular dynamics (MD) and 3D-discrete dislocation dynamics (3D-DDD) simulations are applied to model geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) nucleation mechanisms at early stages of nanoindentation test; providing an insight to the mechanical response of the material and its plastic instability and are in a qualitative agreement with GNDs density mapping images. Finally, we noted that dislocations and defects nucleated are responsible the material hardness increase, as observed in recorded load-displacement curves and pop-ins analysis.</description>

      <title>Giant Uncompensated Magnon Spin Currents in X-type Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon spin currents in insulating magnets are useful for low-power spintronics. However, in magnets stacked by antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange coupling, which have recently aroused significant interest for potential applications in spintronics, these currents are largely counteracted by opposite magnetic sublattices, thus suppressing their net effect. Contrary to this common observation, here, we show that magnets with X-type AFM stacking, where opposite magnetic sublattices form orthogonal intersecting chains, support giant magnon spin currents with minimal compensation. Our model Hamiltonian calculations predict magnetic chain locking of magnon spin currents in these X-type magnets, significantly reducing their compensation ratio. In addition, the one-dimensional nature of the chain-like magnetic sublattices enhances magnon spin conductivities surpassing those of two-dimensional ferromagnets and canonical altermagnets. Notably, uncompensated X-type magnets, such as odd-layer antiferromagnets and ferrimagnets, can exhibit magnon spin currents polarized opposite to those expected by their net magnetization. These unprecedented properties of X-type magnets, combined with their inherent advantages resulting from AFM coupling, offer a promising new path for low-power high-performance spintronics.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the influence of shell thickness in organic functionalized Cu2O nanoparticles on C2+ products distribution in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu-based electrocatalysts exhibits enormous potential for electrochemical CO2 conversion to added-value products. However, high selectivity, specially towards C2+ products, remains a critical challenge for its implementation in commercial applications. Herein, we report the preparation of a series of electrocatalysts based on octadecyl amine (ODA) coated Cu2O nanoparticles. HRTEM images show ODA coatings with thickness from 1.2 to 4 nm. DFT calculations predict that at low surface coverage, ODA tends to lay on the Cu2O surface, leaving hydrophilic regions. Oppositely, at high surface coverage, the ODA molecules are densely packed, being detrimental for both mass and charge transfer. These changes in ODA molecular arrangement explain differences in product selectivity. In situ Raman spectroscopy has revealed that the optimum ODA thickness contributes to the stabilization of key intermediates in the formation of C2+ products, especially ethanol. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and pulse voltammetry measurements confirm that the thicker ODA shells increase charge transfer resistance, while the lowest ODA content promotes faster intermediate desorption rates. At the optimum thickness, the intermediates desorption rates are the slowest, in agreement with the maximum concentration of intermediates observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, thereby resulting in a Faradaic efficiency to ethanol and ethylene over 73 %.</description>

Abstract: Ammonia, a versatile compound that can be used as a fertilizer, chemical or fuel, has since long been produced through the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. Recently, the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) using electricity generated from renewable sources has attracted widespread attention. However, the complex reaction pathway of NO3RR leads to the formation of many undesirable by-products. Herein we successfully prepared a mixed (FeMo)2C catalyst with good electrocatalytic NO3RR, having a NH3 yield of 14.66 mg h-1 cm-2 and an FE of 94.35 % at low potential -0.3 V vs RHE. DFT calculations show that the presence of Fe in Mo2C lattice changes the reaction mechanism, decreasing the potential barrier to be overcome from 1.36 to 0.89 eV. In addition, mixed Fe-Mo carbide facilitates the adsorption of intermediates and promotes NH3 desorption, facilitating NO3- reduction to NH3. In addition, (FeMo)2C was used as cathode for Zn-NO3 battery to generate electricity, producing ammonia at the same time, with a power density of 3.8 mWcm-2 and an NH3 FE of 88 %. This work describes a new synthesis method for mixed metal carbides and provides a promising strategy for NH3 production.</description>

      <title>Photogalvanic Shift Currents in BiFeO3 --LaFeO3 Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing materials with controlled photovoltaic response may lead to improved solar cells or photosensors. In this regard, ferroelectric superlattices have emerged as a rich platform to engineer functional properties. In addition, ferroelectrics are naturally endowed with a bulk photovoltaic response stemming from non-thermalized photoexcited carriers, which can overcome the fundamental limits of current solar cells. Yet, their photovoltaic output has been limited by poor optical absorption and poor charge collection or photo-excited carrier mean free path. We use Density Functional Theory and Wannierization to compute the so-called Bulk Photovoltaic shift current and the optical properties of BiFeO3/LaFeO3 superlattices. We show that, by stacking these two materials, not only the optical absorption is improved at larger wavelengths (due to LaFeO3 smaller bandgap), but the photovolgavanic shift current is also enhanced compared to that of pure BiFeO3 , by suppressing the destructive interferences occurring between different wavelengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit characteristics akin to antiferromagnets, with spin-split anisotropic bands in momentum space. RuO$_2$ has been considered as a prototype altermagnet; however, recent reports have questioned altermagnetic ground state in this material. In this study, we provide direct experimental evidence of altermagnetic characteristics in RuO$_2$ films by demonstrating spin-dependent tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in RuO$_2$-based magnetic tunnel junctions. Our results show the spin-splitted anisotropic band structure of RuO$_2$, with the observed TMR determined by the direction of the N\'eel vector of RuO$_2$. These results reflect the altermagnetic nature of RuO$_2$ and highlight its potential for spintronic applications, leveraging the combined strengths of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Nanodomain Superlattices in Halide Perovskites Giving Picosecond Quantum Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high optoelectronic quality of halide perovskites lends them to be utilized in optoelectronic devices and recently in emerging quantum emission applications. Advancements in perovskite nanomaterials have led to the discovery of processes in which luminescence decay times are sub-100 picoseconds, stimulating the exploration of even faster radiative rates for advanced quantum applications, which have only been prominently realised in III-V materials grown through costly epitaxial growth methods. Here, we discovered ultrafast quantum transients of time scales ~2 picoseconds at low temperature in bulk formamidinium lead iodide films grown through scalable solution or vapour approaches. Using a multimodal strategy, combining ultrafast spectroscopy, optical and electron microscopy, we show that these transients originate from quantum tunnelling in nanodomain superlattices. The outcome of the transient decays, photoluminescence, mirrors the photoabsorption of the states, with an ultra-narrow linewidth at low temperature as low as &lt;2 nm (~4 meV). Localized correlation of the emission and structure reveals that the nanodomain superlattices are formed by alternating ordered layers of corner sharing and face sharing octahedra. This discovery opens new applications leveraging intrinsic quantum properties and demonstrates powerful multimodal approaches for quantum investigations.</description>

      <title>Promising High Temperature Thermoelectric Performance of Alkali Metal-based Zintl phases X$_2$AgY (X = Na, K; Y = Sb, Bi): Insights from First-Principles Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest for novel thermoelectric materials to harvest waste environmental heat, we investigate alkali metal-based Zintl phases X$_2$AgY (X = Na, K, and Y = Sb, Bi) utilizing first-principles methods. We obtain significantly low lattice thermal conductivity values ranging 0.9-0.5 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 300~K, challenging established thermoelectric materials such as SnSe, PbTe, Bi$_2$Te$_3$ as well as other Zintl phases. We trace such astonishingly low values to lattice anharmonicity, large phonon scattering phase space, low phonon velocities, and lifetimes. In K-based materials, the low phonon velocities are further linked to flattened phonon modes arising from the gap in the optical spectrum. Furthermore, the existence of bonding heterogeneity could hamper heat conduction in these materials. In addition, an avoided crossing in the phonon dispersions suggesting rattling behavior, observed in all materials except Na$_2$AgSb, suppresses the dispersion of acoustic modes, further reducing the phonon velocities. When combined with electrical transport calculations, the materials exhibit high figure of merit values at 700~K, i.e., $ZT\sim2.1$ for Na$_2$AgSb, $1.7$ for Na$_2$AgBi, $0.9$ for K$_2$AgSb, and $1.0$ for K$_2$AgBi. Our predicted $ZT$ values are competitive with state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials such as Mg$_3$Sb$_2$, ZrCoBi, PbTe, SnSe, and as well as with contemporary Zintl phases. Our findings underscore the potential of light alkali metal atoms combined with Ag-Bi/Sb type frameworks to achieve superior thermoelectric performance, paving the way for material design for specific operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Interfacial Reconstruction Mechanism Enabling Stable Growth of the Delafossite PdCoO2 on Al2O3 and LaAlO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delafossites, comprised of noble metal (A+) and strongly correlated sublayers (BO2-), form natural superlattices with highly anisotropic properties. These properties hold significant promise for various applications, but their exploitation hinges on the successful growth of high-quality thin films on suitable substrates. Unfortunately, the unique lattice geometry of delafossites presents a significant challenge to thin-film fabrication. Different delafossites grow differently, even when deposited on the same substrate, ranging from successful epitaxy to complete growth suppression. These variations often lack a clear correlation to obvious causes like lattice mismatch. Unidentified stabilization mechanisms appear to enable growth in certain cases, allowing these materials to form stable thin films or act as buffer layers for subsequent delafossite growth. This study employs advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques to investigate the nucleation mechanism underlying the stable growth of PdCoO2 films on Al2O3 and LaAlO3 substrates, grown via molecular-beam epitaxy. Our findings reveal the presence of a secondary phase within the substrate surface that stabilizes the films. This mechanism deviates from the conventional understanding of strain relief mechanisms at oxide heterostructure interfaces and differs significantly from those observed for Cu-based delafossites.</description>

      <title>The link between Microstructural Heterogeneity, Diffusivity, and Hydrogen Embrittlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green hydrogen is likely to play a major role in decarbonising the aviation industry. It is crucial to understand the effects of microstructure on hydrogen redistribution, which may be implicated in the embrittlement of candidate fuel system metals. We have developed a stochastic multiscale finite element modelling framework that integrates micromechanical and hydrogen transport models, such that the dominant microstructural effects can be efficiently accounted for at millimetre length scales. Our results show that microstructure has a significant effect on hydrogen localisation in elastically anisotropic materials, which exhibit an interesting interplay between microstructure and millimetre-scale hydrogen redistribution at various loading rates. Considering 316L stainless steel and nickel, a direct comparison of model predictions against experimental hydrogen embrittlement data reveals that the reported sensitivity to loading rate is strongly linked with rate-dependent grain scale diffusion. These findings highlight the need to incorporate microstructural characteristics in the design of hydrogen resistant materials.</description>

      <title>Interplay of carrier density and mobility in Al-Rich (Al,Ga)N-Channel HEMTs: Impact on high-power device performance potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite considerable advancements, high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) based on gallium nitride (GaN) channels remain largely limited to power applications below 650 V. For higher power demands, the ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor alloy aluminium gallium nitride, (Al,Ga)N, has emerged as a key contender for next-generation HEMTs. In this theoretical study, we show that Al-rich Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N-channel HEMTs (with $x \geq 0.5$) outperform the GaN-channel counterparts at and above room temperature, across all Al compositions, $x$. This contrasts with recent theory reports which suggest that only Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N HEMTs with high Al content ($x \geq 0.85$) offer comparable performance to GaN-channel devices. Unlike previous assumptions of a constant two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density across the entire composition range $x$, we show that the 2DEG density is highly sensitive to both the Al content and thickness of the individual layers in a HEMT structure. We demonstrate that the superior performance of Al-rich (Al,Ga)N-channel HEMTs is driven by a competing effect between 2DEG density and electron mobility. This work challenges the assumptions of prior studies, which can result in a significant under or overestimation of the potential of high Al content HEMTs. The insights gained from our work provide a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between device and material parameters, thus help to guide the design of future Al-rich ($x = 0.5-1.0$) Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N-channel HEMTs for high-power applications.</description>

      <title>Elastically Buckled Film-Substrate System as a Two-dimensional Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressive mechanical stress exceeding a critical value leads to the formation of periodic surface buckling patterns in film-substrate systems. A comprehensive understanding of this buckling phenomenon is desired in applications where the surface topologies are modulated to achieve multifunctionalities. Here we reformulate the finite-deformation elastic theory of a film-substrate system by treating the compliant substrate as a nonlinear elastic solid. The resulting elastic free energy functional of the deflection field is shown to be equivalent to a minimal density functional of phase-field crystal theory plus a Gaussian curvature-related term. The proposed elastic model constructs a phase diagram based on free energy minimization, quantitatively agreeing with the buckling transitions observed in former experiments. The emerging hexagonal buckling system is shown to be equivalent to a two-dimensional crystal with proper scalings. We further conducted simulations of repeated buckling under cyclic stress to demonstrate a dynamically modulated structural adhesive, which resembles the physical process of repeated crystallization and melting near a critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of transition group metals in electric batteries requires extensive usage of critical elements like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which poses significant environmental challenges. Replacing these metals with redox-active organic materials offers a promising alternative, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of batteries by one order of magnitude. However, this approach faces critical obstacles, including the limited availability of suitable redox-active organic materials and issues such as lower electronic conductivity, voltage, specific capacity, and long-term stability. To overcome the limitations for lower voltage and specific capacity, a machine learning (ML) driven battery informatics framework is developed and implemented. This framework utilizes an extensive battery dataset and advanced ML techniques to accelerate and enhance the identification, optimization, and design of redox-active organic materials. In this contribution, a data-fusion ML coupled meta learning model capable of predicting the battery properties, voltage and specific capacity, for various organic negative electrodes and charge carriers (positive electrode materials) combinations is presented. The ML models accelerate experimentation, facilitate the inverse design of battery materials, and identify suitable candidates from three extensive material libraries to advance sustainable energy-storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Generative Topology Optimization: Exploring Diverse Solutions in Structural Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a family of computational methods that derive near-optimal geometries from formal problem descriptions. Despite their success, established TO methods are limited to generating single solutions, restricting the exploration of alternative designs. To address this limitation, we introduce Generative Topology Optimization (GenTO) - a data-free method that trains a neural network to generate structurally compliant shapes and explores diverse solutions through an explicit diversity constraint. The network is trained with a solver-in-the-loop, optimizing the material distribution in each iteration. The trained model produces diverse shapes that closely adhere to the design requirements. We validate GenTO on 2D and 3D TO problems. Our results demonstrate that GenTO produces more diverse solutions than any prior method while maintaining near-optimality and being an order of magnitude faster due to inherent parallelism. These findings open new avenues for engineering and design, offering enhanced flexibility and innovation in structural optimization.</description>

      <title>Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, both $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ QAH states have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG) arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism, driven by the interplay between trigonal warping and staggered layer order under an applied displacement field. Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands into a central touching point and three "leg" Dirac cones. In the presence of staggered layer order, this splitting enables mass inversions driven by the displacement field to occur asynchronously at the central touching point and the "leg" Dirac cones, potentially leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal multilayer graphene systems, predicting the existence of additional QAH states beyond $C = \pm N, \pm 2N$ for $N$-layer graphene.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electrical Properties of Selectively Grown In-Plane InAs Nanowires using InGaAs Buffer and Capping Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Elucidating balling mechanism in laser melting of tantalum using in-situ X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the laser welding and additive manufacturing (AM) communities, the balling defect is primarily attributed to the action of fluid instabilities with a few authors suggesting other mechanisms. Without commenting on the validity of the fluid instability driven \textit{mechanism} of balling in AM, this work intends to present the most realistic analytical discussion of the balling defect driven purely by fluid instabilities. Synchrotron-based X-ray radiography of thin samples indicate that fluid instability growth rates and solidification can be comparable in magnitude and thus compete. Neglecting the action of fluid flows and heat transport, this work presents an analytical formalism which accounts for fluid instabilities and solidification competition, giving a continuous transition from balling to non-balling which is lacking in current literature. We adapt a Rivulet instability model from the fluid physics community to account for the stabilizing effects of the substrate which the Plateau-Rayleigh instability model does not account for, and estimate the instability growth rate. Our model predicts instability growth at higher wavelengths and shallower melt pool depths relative to width, as well as strong sensitivity to the solidification front curvature. Deviations between model predictions and our experimental results demonstrate the importance of fluid flows and heat transport in the balling process. Our experiments further demonstrate at least one mechanism by which the melt pool length and balling wavelength are not equivalent, as commonly claimed.</description>

      <title>Origin of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points in monoclinic trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity was recently found in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure with a phase transition from the monoclinic P2$_1$/a structure to the tetragonal I4/mmm structure. Previous experimental works have confirmed the existence of a tiny energy gap formed with Ni 3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Here we investigate the physical origin of this gap by analyzing symmetry properties of energy bands based on the group theory. The tiny gap comes from energy bands with opposite parity at the Brillouin zone center. In addition, we also find previously unknown Dirac points in some momentum directions around the Fermi level. An effective Hamiltonian is constructed to describe low energy physics of the tiny energy gap and Dirac points. Due to the low crystal symmetry of monoclinic La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, its energy bands display strong anisotropic properties.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconducting diode effect in higher-harmonic InSb nanosheet interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, characterized by the nonreciprocal supercurrent flow, have gained significant attention for their potential in dissipationless electronics. This study presents a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) composed of two Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions. Utilizing prepatterned local backgates, we achieve a gate- and flux-tunable superconducting diode with controllable efficiency in both amplitude and sign. Numerical simulations attribute the diode effect to higher harmonics in the current-phase relation. Crucially, fractional Shapiro step experiments provide direct insights into the evolution of these higher harmonics with flux tuning, showcasing significant enhancements in the second-harmonic signatures of the SQUID near half-integer flux quanta. Furthermore, we investigate the microwave-assisted diode response and experimentally show that the polarity of the diode effect can be switched by the microwave power. These results demonstrate the potential of InSb nanosheet-based hybrid devices as highly tunable elements for use in dissipationless electronics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Machine Learning Potentials through Transfer Learning across Chemical Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Potentials (MLPs) can enable simulations of ab initio accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. However, their effectiveness hinges on the availability of considerable datasets to ensure robust generalization across chemical space and thermodynamic conditions. The generation of such datasets can be labor-intensive, highlighting the need for innovative methods to train MLPs in data-scarce scenarios. Here, we introduce transfer learning of potential energy surfaces between chemically similar elements. Specifically, we leverage the trained MLP for silicon to initialize and expedite the training of an MLP for germanium. Utilizing classical force field and ab initio datasets, we demonstrate that transfer learning surpasses traditional training from scratch in force prediction, leading to more stable simulations and improved temperature transferability. These advantages become even more pronounced as the training dataset size decreases. The out-of-target property analysis shows that transfer learning leads to beneficial but sometimes adversarial effects. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning across chemical elements is a promising technique for developing accurate and numerically stable MLPs, particularly in a data-scarce regime.</description>

      <title>Unusual Red Light Emission from Nonmetallic Cu$_2$Te Microdisk for Laser and SERS Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical characteristics of Cu$_2$Te are poorly investigated due to limited Te sources available and unclear atomic positions of crystal structure. Herein, hexagonal Cu$_2$Te microdisks are successfully prepared via chemical vapor deposition procedure using GaTe as Te source. The epitaxial growth mechanism of the Cu$_2$Te hexagonal structures with the orthorhombic phase are rationalized by proposed layer-over-layer growth model. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of Cu$_2$Te microdisks shows a new red emission band in addition to usual infrared light emission due to Cu deficiency. Single Cu$_2$Te microdisk operates as an optical microcavity supporting whispering gallery modes for red lasing around 627.5 nm. This Cu$_2$Te microdisk microcavity exhibits a high quality factor of 1568 and a low lasing threshold of 125 kW cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Meanwhile, Cu$_2$Te microdisks have been exhibited as an ideal platform for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) eliminating drawbacks of noble metal substrates with detection limitation to nanomolar level and an enhancement factor of $\sim$1.95$\times$10$^5$. Hexagonal Cu$_2$Te microdisks turn out to be an efficient microcavity for red lasing and low-cost nonmetallic SERS substrates, opening potential applications in photonics and biological detection of aromatic molecules.</description>

      <title>Probing the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) in two-dimensional (2D) heterointerfaces is of paramount importance for assessing heat dissipation in 2D-based nanoelectronics. Using graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (Gr/$h$-BN), a structurally isomorphous heterostructure with minimal mass contrast, as a prototype, we develop an accurate yet highly efficient machine-learned potential (MLP) model, which drives nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations on a realistically large system with over 300,000 atoms, enabling us to report the ideal limit range of ITC for 2D heterostructures at room temperature. We further unveil an intriguing stacking-sequence-dependent ITC hierarchy in the Gr/$h$-BN heterostructure, which can be connected to moir\'e patterns and is likely universal in van der Waals layered materials. The underlying atomic-level mechanisms can be succinctly summarized as energy-favorable stacking sequences facilitating out-of-plane phonon energy transmission. This work demonstrates that MLP-driven MD simulations can serve as a new paradigm for probing and understanding thermal transport mechanisms in 2D heterostructures and other layered materials.</description>

      <title>AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome superconductors: a review with transport measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome systems have garnered considerable attention due to the unique features of the sublattice structure and band topology. The recently discovered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A = K, Rb, Cs) host a rich array of symmetry-breaking phases, including exotic charge density waves (CDW), electronic nematicity, pair density waves (PDW) and superconductivity. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations into the diverse phases, several key issues remain contentious, such as a solid clarification of the time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRS-breaking) in the CDW order and its implications for the nature of superconducting (SC) pairing symmetry. This review aims to shed light on the transport properties of these intertwined phases, emphasizing the pivotal role that transport measurements play in uncovering the non-trivial quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench. Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale silicate dust particles are the most abundant refractory component observed in the interstellar medium and thought to play a key role in catalysing the formation of complex organic molecules in the star forming regions of space. We present a method to synthesise a laboratory analogue of nanoscale silicate dust particles on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrates by co-deposition of the atomic constituents. The resulting nanoparticulate films are sufficiently thin and conducting to allow for surface science investigations, and are characterised here, in situ under UHV, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption atomic fine spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy, and, ex situ, using scanning electron microscopy. We compare SiO$_{x}$ film growth with and without the use of atomic O beams during synthesis and conclude that exposure of the sample to atomic O leads to homogeneous films of interconnected nanoparticle networks. The networks covers the graphite substrate and demonstrate superior thermal stability, up to 1073 K, when compared to oxides produced without exposure to atomic O. In addition, control over the flux of atomic O during growth allows for control of the average oxidation state of the film produced. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that fully oxidised films have an SiO$_{2}$ stoichiometry very close to bulk SiO$_{2}$ and scanning tunnelling microscopy images show the basic cluster building unit to have a radius of approximately 2.5 nm. The synthesis of SiO$_{x}$ films with adjustable stoichiometry and suitable for surface science experiments that require conducting substrates will be of great interest to the astrochemistry community, and will allow for nanoscale-investigation of the chemical processes thought to be catalysed at the surface of dust grains in space.</description>

      <title>Restriction of macroscopic structural superlubricity due to structure relaxation by the example of twisted graphene bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of structure relaxation on the potential energy surface (PES) of interlayer interaction of twisted graphene bilayer is studied for a set of commensurate moir\'e systems using the registry-dependent empirical potential of Kolmogorov and Crespi. It is found that the influence of structure relaxation on the amplitude of PES corrugations (determining static friction) depends on the unit cell size (or related twist angle) of the moir\'e system. For moir\'e systems with the smallest unit cells, the amplitudes of PES corrugations calculated with and without account of structure relaxation are approximately the same. However, for large unit cell sizes, the structure relaxation can lead to an increase of PES corrugations by orders of magnitude. This means that structure relaxation can provide the main contribution into the static friction of a superlubric system under certain conditions (such as the contact size and twist angle). Moreover, the change of the PES type because of structure relaxation from a trigonal lattice of maxima to a trigonal lattice of minima is observed for the systems with the moir\'e patterns (5,1) and (5,3). Based on the results obtained, possible crossovers between static friction modes taking place upon changing the twist angle in a macroscopic superlubric system consisting of identical layers are discussed. Additionally it is shown that the PES for relaxed structures can still be approximated by the first Fourier harmonics compatible with symmetries of twisted layers analogously to the PES for rigid layers.</description>

      <title>On determining the energy dispersion of spin excitations with scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional methods to measure the dispersion relations of collective spin excitations involve probing bulk samples with particles such as neutrons, photons or electrons, which carry a well-defined momentum. Open-ended finite-size spin chains, on the contrary, do not have a well-defined momentum due to the lack of translation symmetry, and their spin excitations are measured with an eminently local probe, using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Here we discuss under what conditions STM-IETS spectra can be Fourier-transformed to yield dispersion relations in these systems. We relate the success of this approach to the degree to which spin excitations form standing waves. We show that STM-IETS can reveal the energy dispersion of magnons in ferromagnets and triplons in valence bond crystals, but not that of spinons, the spin excitations in Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains. We compare our theoretical predictions with state-of-the-art measurements on nanographene chains that realize the relevant spin Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: The Berry curvature of phonons is an active subject of research in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a model in which phonons acquire a Berry curvature through their coupling to electrons in crystals with time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate this effect for BaMnSb$_2$, a quasi two-dimensional Dirac insulator, whose low-energy massive Dirac fermions generate a phonon Berry curvature that is proportional to the electronic valley Chern number.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherent Transport of 1D ballistic states in second order topological insulator Bi$_4$Br$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in micrometer-sized single crystals of Bi$_4$Br$_4$, a material predicted to be a second-order topological insulator. 1D topological states with long phase coherence times are revealed via the modulation of quantum interferences with magnetic field and gate voltage. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of Aharanov-Bohm interference between 1D ballistic states several micrometers long, that we identify as phase-coherent hinge modes on neighbouring step edges at the crystal surface. These Aharanov-Bohm interferences are made possible by a disordered phase-coherent contact region, the existence of which is confirmed by STEM/EDX imaging of FIB lamellae. Their coherent nature modulates the transmission of the 1D edge states, leading to weak antilocalization and universal conductance fluctuations with surprisingly large characteristic fields and a strongly anisotropic behavior. These complementary experimental results provide a comprehensive, coherent description of quantum transport in Bi$_4$Br$_4$, and establishes the material as belonging to the class of second-order topological insulators with topologically protected 1D ballistic states.</description>

      <title>Combined Light Excitation and Scanning Gate Microscopy on Heterostructure Nanowire Photovoltaic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale optoelectronic components achieve functionality via spatial variation in electronic structure induced by composition, defects, and dopants. To dynamically change the local band alignment and influence defect states, a scanning gate electrode is highly useful. However, this technique is rarely combined with photoexcitation by a controlled external light source. We explore a setup that combines several types of light excitation with high resolution scanning gate and atomic force microscopy (SGM/AFM). We apply the technique to InAs nanowires with an atomic scale defined InP segment, that have attracted considerable attention for studies of hot carrier devices. Using AFM we image the topography of the nanowire device. SGM measurements without light excitation show how current profiles can be influenced by local gating near the InP segment. Modelling of the tip and nanowire can well predict the results based on the axial band structure variation and an asymmetric tip. SGM studies including light excitation are then performed using both a white light LED and laser diodes at 515 and 780nm. Both negative and positive photoconductance can be observed and the combined effect of light excitation and local gating is observed. SGM can then be used to discriminate between effects related to the wire axial compositional structure and surface states. The setup explored in the current work has significant advantages to study optoelectronics at realistic conditions and with rapid turnover.</description>

      <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-strong coupling (USC) is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths that substantially exceed the threshold for strong coupling. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric nanophotonic platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, we demonstrate ultra-strong coupling to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO$_2$ layer. Our approach leverages a dielectric dual-gradient metasurface supporting quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum (qBIC) consisting of two tapered bars in each unit cell that generate strong out-of-plane electric fields which overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode. Using dual gradients to encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space, we track the anticrossing behaviour of this coupled system with high experimental precision, revealing a mode splitting equivalent to 19% of the ENZ mode energy; a four-to-five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, varying the position of the SiO$_2$ layer allows for deliberate control of the mode overlap and the coupling between the qBIC and either the ENZ mode or the transverse optical (TO) phonon can be selectively tuned. This allows us to experimentally create an USC three-resonator system, opening new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices for sensing and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional composite magnet realizing record-high transverse thermoelectric generation</title>

Abstract: Permanent magnets are used in various products and essential for human society. If omnipresent permanent magnets could directly convert heat into electricity, they would lead to innovative energy harvesting and thermal management technologies. However, achieving such "multifunctionality" has been difficult due to poor thermoelectric performance of conventional magnets. In this work, we develop a multifunctional composite magnet (MCM) that enables giant transverse thermoelectric conversion while possessing permanent magnet features. MCM comprising alternately and obliquely stacked SmCo$_{5}$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_{3}$ multilayers exhibits an excellent transverse thermoelectric performance at room temperature by optimizing its anisotropic structure. Owing to the extremely low interfacial electrical and thermal resistivities, the experimentally determined figure of merit $z_{\rm xy}T$ reaches 0.20 close to the analytically calculated ideal value. The MCM-based thermopile module generates 204 mW in maximum at a temperature difference of 152 K, whose power density normalized by heat transfer area and temperature gradient is not only record-high among transverse thermoelectric modules but also comparable to that of commercial thermoelectric modules utilizing the Seebeck effect. The multifunctionality of our MCM provides unprecedented opportunities for energy harvesting and thermal management everywhere permanent magnets are currently used.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Phase Transitions of Nematic Order in Magnetic Helices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nematic phase lacks translation order but possesses orientational order. Nematic phases have been discovered in a variety of systems, including liquid crystals, correlated materials, and superconductors. Here, we report on a magnetic nematic phase, where the basis components are comprised of magnetic helices. We directly probed the order parameters associated with the magnetic helices using resonant soft X-ray scattering and find two distinct nematic phases with complex spatio-temporal signatures. Using X-ray correlation spectroscopy, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on multiple disparate timescales. Our micromagnetic simulations and density functional theory calculations show that the fluctuations occur concomitantly with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of new degrees of freedom. Our results provide a framework for characterizing exotic phases that can be extended to a broad class of physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a first-principles method to calculate the electron-phonon coupling for specific modes and q-points in the Brillouin Zone for crystalline organic semiconductors. Using the obtained coupling strengths, we propose an approach to compute the temperature-dependent mobilities of electrons and holes. This methodology is applied to both bulk and thin-film polymorphs of tetracene. To validate our treatment of the electronic structures and vibrational properties, we calculate the Raman spectra in the lattice-phonon region and compare them with experimental data. We then compare the computed mobilities with available data for single crystals, finding good agreement within the experimental range, especially when accounting for possible charged impurities. Finally, we discuss the observed differences between the polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Megahertz cycling of ultrafast structural dynamics enabled by nanosecond thermal dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Larger signals can most directly be obtained by higher repetition rates, which, however, are typically limited to a few kHz by the thermal relaxation of thin material films. Here, we combine nanometric electron-beam probing with sample support structures tailored to facilitate rapid specimen cooling. Optical cycling of a charge-density wave transformation enables quantifying the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the heat diffusion in different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to 200 $\mu W/\mu m^2$ within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of 2 MHz. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism is an emerging series of unconventional magnetic materials characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split bands in the momentum space with zero net magnetization. Metallic altermagnets offer unique advantages for exploring applications in spintronics as conductive metals allows for serving as electrode in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and/or manipulation of spincurrent through external field. Through density functional theory calculations, the 2D altermagnet Cr4B3N was predicted to be stable, resulting from a N atom substitution in the FeSe-like CrB bilayer. Both intra- and inter-layered magnetic exchanges between Cr atoms are in antiferromagnetic with the first three neighbours. Leveraging the anisotropic spin-splittings with momentum dependency revealed in band structure, we designed three edge dependent Cr4B3N/square/Cr4B3N in-plane MTJs with the 7 \AA vaccume the barrie. We found that the Cr-B vertical edge-assembled electrodes based MTJs exhibited giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of 91001% , by aligning the conduction channels of the electrodes in parallel and anti-parallel states in the momentum space. Our work deepens and generalizes understanding toward altermagnetic 2D metallic electrode with a newly established metal boride (MBene), and broadens applications of the nanoscale spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism has emerged as a third fundamental category of collinear magnetism, characterized by spin-splitting in symmetry-compensated collinear antiferromagnets, opening new frontiers in spintronics and condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a novel altermagnetic semiconductor, the asymmetric Janus V$_2$AsBrO monolayer, which exhibits a magnetic easy axis favoring the out-of-plane direction and a N\'{e}el temperature ($T_N$) exceeding room temperature. The system exhibits a strain-tunable piezovalley effect, generating valley polarization under uniaxial strain. Notably, hole doping under uniaxial strain generates a net magnetization ($M$) through a piezomagnetic mechanism. Additionally, the broken inversion symmetry endows the monolayer with a substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient $d_{31}$ (2.19 pm/V), presenting broad prospects for the development and design of novel piezoelectric devices. Our findings provide a promising candidate material for the advancement of 2D multifunctional devices in nanoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics, and piezoelectrics.</description>

Abstract: Antimony sulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$), a compound of earth-abundant elements with highly anisotropic, quasi-layered crystal structure, triggered growing interest as a solar absorber in photovoltaics and as a phase change material in memory devices, yet challenges remain in achieving high-quality thin films with controlled nucleation and growth for optimal performance. Here, we investigate the phase transformation, crystal structure and properties, growth and degradation of atomic layer deposited Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films using in situ TEM and correlative ex situ analysis. The as-deposited amorphous films crystallized at 243{\deg}C, forming grains with an [100] out-of-plane texture and developed into tens to hundreds of micrometer, leaves-shaped grains. Introducing an ultra-thin ZnS interfacial layer increased nucleation density, and resulted in a few micrometer-sized, more uniform grains while retaining the overall [100] texture. In situ observations and subsequent crystal orientation analysis with cutting-edge 4D-STEM and EBSD revealed that the grains grew faster along the [010] ribbon direction and that the bare films underwent early-stage degradation, forming holes in amorphous regions during annealing. The ZnS interlayer mitigated degradation, stabilizing the films and improving their uniformity. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films for applications both as solar cell materials and phase change materials.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we introduced the screened-exchange range-separated hybrid (SE-RSH) functional to account for spatially dependent dielectric screening in complex materials. The SE-RSH functional has shown good performance in predicting the electronic properties of a large variety of semiconductors and insulators, and of heterogeneous systems composed of building blocks with large dielectric mismatch. Here, we assess the performance of SE-RSH for oxide materials, including antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides. Through a comparison with other dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals, we demonstrate that SE-RSH yields improved predictions of dielectric constants and band gaps, bringing them into a closer agreement with experimental values. The functional also provides accurate values of magnetic moments of several oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a programmable photonic platform that integrates Thouless pumping and reconfigurable lasing in sliding bilayer photonic crystals. By engineering two periodic potentials -- a slowly moving photonic grating atop a stationary one -- we demonstrate how their interplay yields distinct topological phases characterized by either robust light transport (Thouless pumping) or localized spatial oscillation (trapping). A heterojunction between crystals in these two regimes supports an interface mode stemming from the topological phase transition across the boundary. This interface mode can be actively tuned via microelectromechanical systems or switched through the integration of phase-change materials. We further establish the feasibility of lasing action at this interface mode, offering a pathway toward topologically robust and reconfigurable lasers. Our findings provide a framework for exploring topological phase transitions and unify the fields of topological photonics and programmable photonic devices, opening avenues for multidimensionally tunable light sources.</description>

      <title>Origin of the density wave instability in trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ revealed by optical and ultrafast spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the intricate phase diagram of unconventional superconductors characterized by intertwined electronic orders and superconductivity, a key step in understanding the superconducting mechanism is to investigate the parent compounds from which superconductivity emerges through doping or pressure. In this study, we employed optical spectroscopy and ultrafast reflectivity measurements to examine the density wave instability in the trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which displays pressure-induced superconductivity up to 30 K. Our optical spectroscopy measurements reveal that La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ behaves as a metal with a high plasma frequency. Upon cooling, we observed a distinct formation of a density wave energy gap in both optical conductivity and pump-probe measurements. The gap feature is more pronounced compared to the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparison of the experimentally determined plasma frequency with first-principles calculations, we classify La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ as a moderately electron-correlated material, resembling the parent compound of iron-based superconductors but exhibiting weaker correlation than the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. The enhanced gap feature and weaker electronic correlation in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ may explain its lower superconductivity transition temperature under high pressure. These findings significantly advance our comprehension of the density wave and superconductivity mechanisms in the trilayer nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.</description>

      <title>A Novel Constrained Sampling Method for Efficient Exploration in Materials and Chemical Mixture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient exploration of multicomponent material composition spaces is often limited by time and financial constraints, particularly when mixture and synthesis constraints exist. Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The software and case studies are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Topological Defects in Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes as Triplet Exciton Traps and Single-Photon Emitters</title>

Abstract: We investigate the role of topological defects in exciton behavior in (6,5) semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes using density functional theory. Our study identifies the helical Stone-Wales defect as a prominent trap for triplet excitons, characterized by a large zero-field splitting consistent with experimental data and a small singlet-triplet gap. The weak electron-phonon coupling, as evidenced by a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.74, renders it a promising single-photon emitter, with the zero-phonon line predicted at 1.6 $\mu$m, within the telecom range. These insights into defect-engineered electronic structure and exciton dynamics offer promising opportunities for improving the performance of carbon nanotube-based quantum light sources and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the crystal structure of the bilayer nickel oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and analysis of possible unconventional superconductivity</title>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</description>
