      <title>Binary craters on Ceres and Vesta and implications for binary asteroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Airless planetary objects have their surfaces covered by craters, and these can be used to study the characteristics of asteroid populations. Planetary surfaces present binary craters that are associated with the synchronous impact of binary asteroids. Aims. We identify binary craters on asteroids (1) Ceres and (4) Vesta, and aim to characterize the properties (size ratio and orbital plane) of the binary asteroids that might have formed them. Methods. We used global crater databases developed in previous studies and mosaics of images from the NASA DAWN mission high-altitude and low-altitude mapping orbits. We established selection criteria to identify craters that were most likely a product of the impact of a binary asteroid. We performed numerical simulations to predict the orientation of the binary craters assuming the population of impactors has mutual orbits coplanar with heliocentric orbits, as the current census of binary asteroids suggests. We compared our simulations with our survey of binary craters on Ceres and Vesta through a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results. We find geomorphological evidence of 39 and 18 synchronous impacts on the surfaces of Ceres and Vesta, respectively. The associated binary asteroids are widely separated and similar in diameter. The distributions of the orientation of these binary craters on both bodies are statistically different from numerical impact simulations that assume binary asteroids with coplanar mutual and heliocentric orbits. Conclusions. Although the identification of binary craters on both bodies and the sample size are limited, these findings are consistent with a population of well-separated and similarly sized binary asteroids with nonzero obliquity that remains to be observed, in agreement with the population of binary craters identified on Mars.</description>

      <title>Isotopic evidence of long-lived volcanism on Io</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's moon Io hosts extensive volcanism driven by tidal heating. The isotopic composition of Io's inventory of volatile elements, including sulfur and chlorine, reflects its outgassing and mass loss history and provides an avenue for exploring its evolution. We used millimeter observations of Io's atmosphere to measure sulfur isotopes in gaseous SO2 and SO, and chlorine isotopes in gaseous NaCl and KCl. We find $^{34}$S/$^{32}$S=0.0595$\pm$0.0038 ($\delta^{34}$S=+347$\pm$86 per mille), which is highly enriched compared to average Solar System values and indicates that Io has lost 94 to 99% of its available sulfur. Our measurement of $^{37}$Cl/$^{35}$Cl=0.403$\pm$0.028 ($\delta^{37}$Cl=+263$\pm$88 per mille) shows chlorine is similarly enriched. These measurements indicate that Io has been volcanically active for most or all of its history, with potentially higher outgassing and mass-loss rates at earlier times.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical thermal model for craters with application to the crater-induced YORP effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The YORP effect is the thermal torque generated by radiation from the surface of an asteroid. The effect is sensitive to surface topology, including small-scale roughness, boulders, and craters.
  Aims: The aim of this paper is to develop a computationally efficient semi-analytical model for the crater-induced YORP (CYORP) effect that can be used to investigate the functional dependence of this effect.
  Methods. This study obtains the temperature field in a crater over a rotational period in the form of a Fourier series, accounting for the effects of self-sheltering, self-radiation, and self-scattering.
  Results. We obtain the temperature field of a crater, accounting for the thermal inertia, crater shape, and crater location. We then find that the CYORP effect is negligible when the depth-to-diameter ratio is smaller than 0.05. In this case, it is reasonable to assume a convex shape for YORP calculations. Varying the thermal conductivity yields a consistent value of approximately 0.01 for the spin component of the CYORP coefficient, while the obliquity component is inversely related to thermal inertia, declining from 0.004 in basalt to 0.001 in metal. For a z-axis symmetric shape, the CYORP spin component vanishes, while the obliquity component persists. Our model confirms that the total YORP torque is damped by a few tens of percent by uniformly distributed small-scale surface roughness. Furthermore, for the first time, we calculate the change in the YORP torque at each impact on the surface of an asteroid explicitly and compute the resulting stochastic spin evolution more precisely.
  Conclusions. The semi-analytical method that we developed, which benefits from fast computation, offers new perspectives for future investigations of the YORP modeling of real asteroids and for the complete rotational and orbital evolution of asteroids accounting for collisions.</description>

      <title>Computing low-thrust transfers in the asteroid belt, a comparison between astrodynamical manipulations and a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-thrust trajectories play a crucial role in optimizing scientific output and cost efficiency in asteroid belt missions. Unlike high-thrust transfers, low-thrust trajectories require solving complex optimal control problems. This complexity grows exponentially with the number of asteroids visited due to orbital mechanics intricacies. In the literature, methods for approximating low-thrust transfers without full optimization have been proposed, including analytical and machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose new analytical approximations and compare their accuracy and performance to machine learning methods. While analytical approximations leverage orbit theory to estimate trajectory costs, machine learning employs a more black-box approach, utilizing neural networks to predict optimal transfers based on various attributes. We build a dataset of about 3 million transfers, found by solving the time and fuel optimal control problems, for different time of flights, which we also release open-source. Comparison between the two methods on this database reveals the superiority of machine learning, especially for longer transfers. Despite challenges such as multi revolution transfers, both approaches maintain accuracy within a few percent in the final mass errors, on a database of trajectories involving numerous asteroids. This work contributes to the efficient exploration of mission opportunities in the asteroid belt, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of different approximation strategies.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG. LVII. TOI-5076b: A warm sub-Neptune planet orbiting a thin-to-thick-disk transition star in a wide binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We report the confirmation of a new transiting exoplanet orbiting the star TOI-5076. Methods. We present our vetting procedure and follow-up observations which led to the confirmation of the exoplanet TOI-5076b. In particular, we employed high-precision {\it TESS} photometry, high-angular-resolution imaging from several telescopes, and high-precision radial velocities from HARPS-N. Results. From the HARPS-N spectroscopy, we determined the spectroscopic parameters of the host star: T$\rm_{eff}$=(5070$\pm$143) K, log~g=(4.6$\pm$0.3), [Fe/H]=(+0.20$\pm$0.08), and [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.05$\pm$0.06. The transiting planet is a warm sub-Neptune with a mass m$\rm_p=$(16$\pm$2) M$\rm_{\oplus}$, a radius r$\rm_p=$(3.2$\pm$0.1)~R$\rm_{\oplus}$ yielding a density $\rho_p$=(2.8$\pm$0.5) g cm$^{-3}$. It revolves around its star approximately every 23.445 days. Conclusions. The host star is a metal-rich, K2V dwarf, located at about 82 pc from the Sun with a radius of R$_{\star}$=(0.78$\pm$0.01) R$_{\odot}$ and a mass of M$_{\star}$=(0.80$\pm$0.07) M$_{\odot}$. It forms a common proper motion pair with an M-dwarf companion star located at a projected separation of 2178 au. The chemical analysis of the host-star and the Galactic-space velocities indicate that TOI-5076 belongs to the old population of thin-to-thick-disk transition stars. The density of TOI-5076b suggests the presence of a large fraction by volume of volatiles overlying a massive core. We found that a circular orbit solution is marginally favored with respect to an eccentric orbit solution for TOI-5076b.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric characterisation of exoplanet host stars in preparation of the Ariel mission. Magnetic environment of HD 63433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of the stellar magnetism of planetary host stars has been gaining momentum, especially in the context of transmission spectroscopy investigations of exoplanets. Indeed, the magnetic field regulates the amount of energetic radiation and stellar wind impinging on planets, as well as the presence of inhomogeneities on the stellar surface that hinder the precise extraction of the planetary atmospheric absorption signal. We initiated a spectropolarimetric campaign to unveil the magnetic field properties of known exoplanet hosting stars included in the current list of potential Ariel targets. In this work, we focus on HD 63433, a young solar-like star hosting two sub-Neptunes and an Earth-sized planet. These exoplanets orbit within 0.15 au from the host star and have likely experienced different atmospheric evolutionary paths. We analysed optical spectropolarimetric data collected with ESPaDOnS, HARPSpol, and Neo-Narval to compute the magnetic activity indices (log R'_HK , H$\alpha$, and Ca ii infrared triplet), measure the longitudinal magnetic field, and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology via Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). The magnetic field map was then employed to simulate the space environment in which the exoplanets orbit. The reconstructed stellar magnetic field has an average strength of 24 G and it features a complex topology with a dominant toroidal component, in agreement with other stars of a similar spectral type and age. Our simulations of the stellar environment locate 10% of the innermost planetary orbit inside the Alfv\'en surface and, thus, brief magnetic connections between the planet and the star can occur. The outer planets are outside the Alfv\'en surface and a bow shock between the stellar wind and the planetary magnetosphere could potentially form.</description>

      <title>MHD simulations of the space weather in Proxima b: Habitability conditions and radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The habitability of exoplanets hosted by M-dwarf stars dramatically depends on their space weather. We present 3D magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to characterise the magneto-plasma environment and thus the habitability of the Earth-like planet Proxima b when it is subject to both calm and extreme (CME-like) space weather conditions. We study the role of the stellar wind and planetary magnetic field, and determine the radio emission arising from the interaction between the stellar wind of Proxima and the magnetosphere of its planet Proxima b. We find that if Prox b has a magnetic field similar to that of the Earth ($B_{\rm p} = B_\oplus \approx 0.32$ G) or larger, the magnetopause standoff distance is large enough to shield the surface from the stellar wind for essentially any planetary tilt but the most extreme values (close to $90^{\circ} $), under a calm space weather. Even if Proxima b is subject to more extreme space weather conditions, the planet is well shielded by an Earth-like magnetosphere ($B_{\rm p} \approx B_\oplus$; $ \approx 23.5^{\circ}$), or if it has tilt smaller than that of the Earth. For calm space weather conditions, the radio emission caused by the day-side reconnection regions can be as high as 7$\times10^{19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the super-Alfv\'enic regime, and is on average almost an order of magnitude larger than the radio emission in the sub-Alfv\'enic cases, due to the much larger contribution of the bow shock. We also find that the energy dissipation at the bow shock is independent of the angle between the planet's magnetic dipole and the incident stellar wind flow. If Prox b is subject to extreme space weather conditions, the radio emission is more than two orders of magnitude larger than under calm space weather conditions. This result yields expectations for a direct detection--from Earth--in radio of giant planets in close-in orbits.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Aeronomy: A Case Study of WASP-69b's Variable Thermosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aeronomy, the study of Earth's upper atmosphere and its interaction with the local space environment, has long traced changes in the thermospheres of Earth and other solar system planets to solar variability in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (collectively, "XUV") bands. Extending comparative aeronomy to the short-period extrasolar planets may illuminate whether stellar XUV irradiation powers atmospheric outflows that change planetary radii on astronomical timescales. In recent years, near-infrared transit spectroscopy of metastable HeI has been a prolific tracer of high-altitude planetary gas. We present a case study of exoplanet aeronomy using metastable HeI transit observations from Palomar/WIRC and follow-up high-energy data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory that were taken within one month of the WASP-69 system, a K-type main sequence star with a well-studied hot Jupiter companion. Supplemented by archival data, we find that WASP-69's X-ray flux in 2023 was less than 50% of what was recorded in 2016 and that the metastable HeI absorption from WASP-69b was lower in 2023 versus past epochs from 2017-2019. Via atmospheric modeling, we show that this time-variable metastable HeI signal is in the expected direction given the observed change in stellar XUV, possibly stemming from WASP-69's magnetic activity cycle. Our results underscore the ability of multi-epoch, multi-wavelength observations to paint a cohesive picture of the interaction between an exoplanet's atmosphere and its host star.</description>

      <title>Observation of Significant Photosynthesis in Garden Cress and Cyanobacteria under Simulated Illumination from a K Dwarf Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars with about 45 to 80% the mass of the Sun, so-called K dwarf stars, have previously been proposed as optimal host stars in the search for habitable extrasolar worlds. These stars are abundant, have stable luminosities over billions of years longer than Sun-like stars, and offer favorable space environmental conditions. So far, the theoretical and experimental focus on exoplanet habitability has been on even less massive, though potentially less hospitable red dwarf stars. Here we present the first experimental data on the responses of photosynthetic organisms to a simulated K dwarf spectrum. We find that garden cress Lepidium sativum under K-dwarf radiation exhibits comparable growth and photosynthetic efficiency as under solar illumination on Earth. The cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 exhibits significantly higher photosynthetic efficiency and culture growth under K dwarf radiation compared to solar conditions. Our findings of the affirmative responses of these two photosynthetic organisms to K dwarf radiation suggest that exoplanets in the habitable zones around such stars deserve high priority in the search for extrasolar life.</description>

      <title>Seasonal and longitudinal variability in Io's SO2 atmosphere from 22 years of IRTF/TEXES observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between 2001 and 2023, we obtained high spectral resolution mid-infrared observations of Io using the TEXES instrument at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. These observations were centered at 529.8 cm-1 (18.88 {\mu}m) and include several SO2 absorption lines. By modeling the shapes and strengths of these absorption lines, we are able to determine how Io's SO2 atmospheric density varies over the 22-year time period, covering nearly two Jovian years. Previous analysis has shown that the density of Io's atmosphere on the anti-Jovian hemisphere exhibits clear seasonal temporal variability, which can be modeled as the sum of a seasonally-varying frost sublimation component and a constant component, assumed to be volcanic. The new data show that the seasonal pattern repeats during the second Jovian year, confirming the importance of sublimation support. The considerable longitudinal variability in Io's atmospheric density found in previous work is also stable over the second Jovian year with the SO2 column density on the Jupiter-facing hemisphere being 5--8 times lower than the anti-Jovian hemisphere. For the first time, we detect seasonal variability on the Jupiter-facing hemisphere as well. This can also be modeled as a combination of sublimation and a small constant source. The lower atmospheric density on the Jupiter-facing hemisphere can plausibly be explained by the daily Jupiter eclipses, which decrease the surface temperature and therefore reduce the sublimation-driven component of the atmosphere, combined with a lower level of volcanic activity directly emitting SO2 into the atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: In Patil et. al 2024a, we developed a multitaper power spectrum estimation method, mtNUFFT, for analyzing time-series with quasi-regular spacing, and showed that it not only improves upon the statistical issues of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, but also provides a factor of three speed up in some applications. In this paper, we combine mtNUFFT with the harmonic F-test to test the hypothesis that a strictly periodic signal or its harmonic (as opposed to e.g. a quasi-periodic signal) is present at a given frequency. This mtNUFFT/F-test combination shows that multitapering allows detection of periodic signals and precise estimation of their frequencies, thereby improving both power spectrum estimation and harmonic analysis. Using asteroseismic time-series data for the Kepler-91 red giant, we show that the F-test automatically picks up the harmonics of its transiting exoplanet as well as certain dipole ($l=1$) mixed modes. We use this example to highlight that we can distinguish between different types of stellar oscillations, e.g., transient (damped, stochastically-excited) and strictly periodic (undamped, heat-driven). We also illustrate the technique of dividing a time-series into chunks to further examine the transient versus periodic nature of stellar oscillations. The harmonic F-test combined with mtNUFFT is implemented in the public Python package tapify (https://github.com/aaryapatil/tapify), which opens opportunities to perform detailed investigations of periodic signals in time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Near-Infrared Gatherer of Helium Transits (NIGHT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the subsystems of the NIGHT instrument. NIGHT (the Near Infrared Gatherer of Helium Transits) is a narrowband, high-resolution spectrograph, marking the first dedicated survey instrument for exoplanetary atmosphere observations. Developed through a collaboration between the Observatory of Geneva and the Universite de Montreal, NIGHT aims to conduct an extensive statistical survey of helium atmospheres around 100+ exoplanets over several years. The instrument will report new detections of helium in exoplanet atmospheres and perform temporal monitoring of a subset of these.
  NIGHT measures absorption from the metastable helium state during exoplanet transits, observable in a triplet of lines around 1083nm. The instrument comprises a vacuum enclosure housing the spectrograph, a front end unit for fiber injection at the telescope's focal plane, and a calibration and control rack containing calibration light sources and control hardware.
  The spectrograph is optimized for efficiency, achieving a uniform throughput of approximately 71%. The primary disperser employs a VPH grating in a unique double-pass configuration, enabling a spectral resolution of 75,000 while maintaining high throughput. The detector is a HAWAII-1 infrared array, cooled to 85K, with the spectrograph operating at room temperature. Thanks to its relatively high throughput, NIGHT on a 2m class telescope is predicted to be as sensitive as existing instruments on 4m class telescopes.
  The front end unit injects starlight and sky background into two separate fibers leading to the spectrograph. It also performs near-infrared guiding and includes a mechanism for injecting calibration light.
  The assembly and optical alignment of NIGHT's spectrograph and front end unit are scheduled for July to September 2024, with the first light anticipated before early 2025.</description>

      <title>PT and anti-PT symmetries for astrophysical waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Discrete symmetries have found numerous applications in photonics and quantum mechanics, but remain little studied in fluid mechanics, particularly in astrophysics. Aims: We aim to show how PT and anti-PT symmetries determine the behaviour of linear perturbations in a wide class of astrophysical problems. They set the location of Exceptional Points in the parameter space and the associated transitions to instability, and are associated to the conservation of quadratic quantities that can be determined explicitly. Methods: We study several classical local problems: the gravitational instability of isothermal spheres and thin discs, the Schwarzschild instability, the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability and acoustic waves in dust-gas mixtures. We calculate the locations and the order of the Exceptional Points with a method of resultant, as well as the conserved quantities in the different regions of the parameter space using Krein theory. Results: All problems studied here exhibit discrete symmetries, even though Hermiticity is broken by different physical processes (self-gravity, buoyancy, diffusion, drag). This analysis provides genuine explanations for certain instabilities, and for the existence of regions in the parameter space where waves do not propagate. Those correspond to breaking of PT and anti-PT symmetries respectively. Not all instabilities are associated to symmetry breaking (e.g. the Rayleigh-Benard instability).</description>

      <title>Calibration of MAJIS (Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer): III. Spectral Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer (MAJIS) is the visible and near-infrared imaging spectrometer onboard ESA s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission. Before its integration into the spacecraft, the instrument undergoes an extensive ground calibration to establish its baseline performances. This process prepares the imaging spectrometer for flight operations by characterizing the behavior of the instrument under various operative conditions and uncovering instrumental distortions that may depend on instrumental commands. Two steps of the on-ground calibration campaigns were held at the instrument level to produce the data. Additional in-flight measurements have recently been obtained after launch during the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase. In this article, we present the analyses of these datasets, focusing on the characterization of the spectral performances. First, we describe and analyze the spectral calibration datasets obtained using both monochromatic sources and polychromatic sources coupled with solid and gas samples. Then, we derive the spectral sampling and the spectral response function over the entire field of view. These spectral characteristics are quantified for various operational parameters of MAJIS, such as temperature and spectral binning. The derived on-ground performances are then compared with in-flight measurements obtained after launch and presented in the framework of the MAJIS performance requirements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunneling Could Enable Proton Transfer Reactions on Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is rich in organics and is often suggested to model early Earth environments. Titan's surface is cold, at a temperature of approximately 90 K, which prohibits most thermally activated chemical reactions. However, quantum effects become more important at low temperatures and reactions that are classically prohibited can often proceed through quantum mechanical pathways. Using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate nuclear quantum effects on the thermodynamics of model proton transfer reactions in liquid ethane. We find that proton transfer can occur at Titan surface conditions through quantum tunneling. Consequently, we estimate that nuclear quantum effects can enhance reaction rates by many orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that nuclear quantum effects could facilitate prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and quantum effects should be considered in future investigations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Stellar and Planetary Properties of the 51 Eridani System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to study exoplanets, a comprehensive characterization of the fundamental properties of the host stars, such as angular diameter, temperature, luminosity, and age, is essential, as the formation and evolution of exoplanets are directly influenced by the host stars at various points in time. In this paper, we present interferometric observations taken of directly imaged planet host 51 Eridani at the CHARA Array. We measure the limb-darkened angular diameter of HD 29391 to be $\theta_{\rm LD} = 0.450\pm 0.006 \rm ~mas$ and combining with the Gaia zero-point corrected parallax, we get a stellar radius of $1.45 \pm 0.02 \rm~R_{\odot}$. We use the PARSEC isochrones to estimate an age of $23.2^{+1.7}_{-2.0} \rm ~Myr$ and a mass of $1.550^{+0.006}_{-0.005}\rm ~M_{\odot}$. The age and mass agree well with values in the literature, determined through a variety of methods ranging from dynamical age trace-backs to lithium depletion boundary methods. We derive a mass of $4.1 \pm 0.4\rm ~M_{Jup}$ for 51 Eri b using the Sonora Bobcat models, which further supports the possibility of 51 Eri b forming under either the hot-start formation model or the warm-start formation model.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous multicolour transit photometry of hot Jupiters HAT-P-19b, HAT-P-51b, HAT-P-55b, and HAT-P-65b</title>

Abstract: Accurate physical parameters of exoplanet systems are essential for further exploration of planetary internal structure, atmospheres, and formation history. We aim to use simultaneous multicolour transit photometry to improve the estimation of transit parameters, to search for transit timing variations (TTVs), and to establish which of our targets should be prioritised for follow-up transmission spectroscopy. We performed time series photometric observations of 12 transits for the hot Jupiters HAT-P-19b, HAT-P-51b, HAT-P-55b, and HAT-P-65b using the simultaneous four-colour camera MuSCAT2 on the Telescopio Carlos S\'anchez. We collected 56 additional transit light curves from TESS photometry. To derive transit parameters, we modelled the MuSCAT2 light curves with Gaussian processes to account for correlated noise. To derive physical parameters, we performed EXOFASTv2 global fits to the available transit and radial velocity data sets, together with the Gaia DR3 parallax, isochrones, and spectral energy distributions. To assess the potential for atmospheric characterisation, we compared the multicolour transit depths with a flat line and a clear atmosphere model. We consistently refined the transit and physical parameters. We improved the orbital period and ephemeris estimates, and found no evidence for TTVs or orbital decay. The MuSCAT2 broadband transmission spectra of HAT-P-19b and HAT-P-65b are consistent with previously published low-resolution transmission spectra. We also found that, except for HAT-P-65b, the assumption of a planetary atmosphere can improve the fit to the MuSCAT2 data. In particular, we identified HAT-P-55b as a priority target among these four planets for further atmospheric studies using transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Giant branch planetary systems: Dynamical and radiative evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In seven billion years, the Sun will be dead. As stars like the Sun pass from their present state to that of a dead white dwarf star, they undergo two phases of extremely high luminosity and radius -- the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch -- during which they will lose half or more of their mass. These changes to the star have a significant impact on orbiting planets, asteroids and comets. The large stellar radius (beyond the current orbit of the Earth) leads to the engulfment of bodies entering the stellar envelope, a process enhanced by strong tidal interactions. The high luminosity affects bodies' orbits and physical properties, while mass loss can later trigger the destabilisation of bodies around white dwarfs. It is necessary to understand these processes to understand both the future of our Solar System, and to interpret growing observations of planetary systems around evolved stars.</description>

      <title>Improving Power Spectrum Estimation using Multitapering: Efficient asteroseismic analyses for understanding stars, the Milky Way, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismic time-series data have imprints of stellar oscillation modes, whose detection and characterization through time-series analysis allows us to probe stellar interior physics. Such analyses usually occur in the Fourier domain by computing the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, an estimator of the power spectrum underlying unevenly-sampled time-series data. However, the LS periodogram suffers from the statistical problems of (1) inconsistency (or noise) and (2) bias due to high spectral leakage. Here, we develop a multitaper power spectrum estimator using the Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (mtNUFFT) to tackle the inconsistency and bias problems of the LS periodogram. Using a simulated light curve, we show that the mtNUFFT power spectrum estimate of solar-like oscillations has lower variance and bias than the LS estimate. We also apply our method to the Kepler-91 red giant, and combine it with PBjam peakbagging to obtain mode parameters and a derived age estimate of $3.97 \pm 0.52$ Gyr. PBjam allows the improvement of age precision relative to the $4.27 \pm 0.75$ Gyr APOKASC-2 (uncorrected) estimate, whereas partnering mtNUFFT with PBjam speeds up peakbagging thrice as much as LS. This increase in efficiency has promising implications for Galactic archaeology, in addition to stellar structure and evolution studies. Our new method generally applies to time-domain astronomy and is implemented in the public Python package tapify, available at https://github.com/aaryapatil/tapify.</description>
