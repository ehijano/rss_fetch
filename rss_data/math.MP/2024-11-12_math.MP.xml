      <title>Causal Fermion Systems: An Introduction to Fundamental Structures, Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This textbook introduces the basic concepts of the theory of causal fermion systems, a recent approach to the description of fundamental physics. The theory yields quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory as limiting cases and is therefore a candidate for a unified physical theory. From the mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a general framework for describing and analyzing non-smooth geometries and "quantum geometries." The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, the causal action principle.
  The book includes a detailed summary of the mathematical and physical preliminaries. It explains the physical concepts behind the causal fermion system approach from the basics. Moreover, all the mathematical objects and structures are introduced step by step. The mathematical methods used for the analysis of causal fermion systems and the causal action principle are introduced in depth. Many examples and applications are worked out.
  The textbook is addressed to master and graduate students in mathematics or physics. Furthermore, it serves as a reference work for researchers working in the field.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>

      <title>Families of Kuramoto models and bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the families of Kuramoto models (KM) related to bounded symmetric domains. The families include the Lohe unitary model and the spherical models as special cases. Our approach is based on the construction proposed by Watanabe and Strogats WS. We replace the Poincare disc and its $S^1$ boundary in the WS construction on the bounded symmetric domains and on the its Bergman-Shilov (BS) boundaries. In Cartan classifications there are four classical domains of types I-IV. Here we consider the domains of types I,II and III. For a fixed domain there is a decreasing chain of the BS boundaries components. This leads to the KM families we described here.</description>

      <title>Exact linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states (NEASS) approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_H$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance.
  A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</description>

      <title>The Ground State Energy of Heavy Atoms: Leading and Subleading Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study atomic ground state energies for neutral atoms as the nuclear charge $Z$ is large in the no-pair formalism. We show that for a large class of projections defining the underlying Dirac sea -- covering not only the physical reasonable cases but also ``weird'' ones -- the corresponding no-pair ground state energy does not exceed the one of the Furry energy up to subleading order. An essential tool is the use and extension of S\'er\'e's results on atomic Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Maxwell-Schr\"odinger and Vlasov-Maxwell Equations from Non-Relativistic QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spinless Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in a semiclassical mean-field limit of many fermions. For appropriate initial conditions, we prove, in the trace norm topology of reduced density matrices, that the many-body quantum state converges to a tensor product of a semiclassically structured Slater determinant and a coherent photon state. These evolve according to a fermionic variant of the Maxwell-Schr\"odinger equations. By combining this result with [arXiv:2308.16074] through a suitable regularization of the initial data, we further show that, in the limit of large particle number, the dynamics of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian can be approximately described by the non-relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system for extended charges.</description>

      <title>Generalized Airy polynomials, Hankel determinants and asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further study the orthogonal polynomials with respect to the generalized Airy weight based on the work of Clarkson and Jordaan [{\em J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.} {\bf 54} ({2021}) {185202}]. We prove the ladder operator equations and associated compatibility conditions for orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Laguerre-type weight of the form $w(x)=x^\lambda w_0(x),\;\la&gt;-1, x\in\mathbb{R}^+$. By applying them to the generalized Airy polynomials, we are able to derive a discrete system for the recurrence coefficients. Combining with the Toda evolution, we establish the relation between the recurrence coefficients, the sub-leading coefficient of the monic generalized Airy polynomials and the associated Hankel determinant. Using Dyson's Coulomb fluid approach and with the aid of the discrete system for the recurrence coefficients, we obtain the large $n$ asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients and the sub-leading coefficient of the monic generalized Airy polynomials. The large $n$ asymptotics (including the constant term) of the Hankel determinant has been derived by using a recent result in the literature. The long-time asymptotics of these quantities have also been discussed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Conservation Law and Trace Anomaly for the Stress Energy Tensor of a Self-Interacting Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a self-interacting, massive, real scalar field on a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime and the associated stress-energy tensor. Using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theory, we study the associated, Wick-ordered, quantum observable. In particular we generalize a construction, first developed in the free field theory scenario by Moretti in [Mor03], aimed at exploiting the existing freedoms in the definition of the classical stress-energy tensor, in order to define a quantum counterpart which is divergence free. We prove that this procedure can be adapted also to cubic or quartic self-interactions, at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^3)$ in perturbation theory. As in the free field scenario, the price to pay for ensuring that the quantum stress-energy tensor is divergence free is the emergence of a trace anomaly, which is here computed for a quartic self-interaction.</description>

Abstract: In these lectures we review two approaches to constructing particle actions from coset spaces of symmetry groups: non-linear realisations and coadjoint orbits. At the level of particle actions, we observe that they coincide. We also provide an introduction to symplectic geometry and we sketch the theory of coadjoint orbits for the Poincar\'e group.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study eigenfunction localization for higher dimensional cat maps, a popular model of quantum chaos. These maps are given by linear symplectic maps in ${\mathrm Sp}(2g,\mathbb Z)$, which we take to be ergodic. Under some natural assumptions, we show that there is a density one sequence of integers $N$ so that as $N$ tends to infinity along this sequence, all eigenfunctions of the quantized map at the inverse Planck constant $N$ are uniformly distributed. For the two-dimensional case ($g=1$), this was proved by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). The higher dimensional case offers several new features and requires a completely different set of tools, including from additive combinatorics, in particular Bourgain's bound (2005) for Mordell sums, and a study of tensor product structures for the cat map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06047v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to construct 1D Hamiltonians, that is, Jacobi matrices, that realize perfect quantum state transfer and also have the property that the overlap of the time evolved state with the initial state is zero for some time before the transfer time. If the latter takes place we call it an early exclusion state. We also show that in some case early state exclusion is impossible. The proofs rely on properties of Krawtchouk and Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Crystallographic Orientation Effects on Tunneling Magnetoresistance via Transfer Matrix and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer matrix method (TMM) is widely used to analyze the transport properties of one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional systems, such as nanostructures and layered materials in spintronics. However, its application in quantifying the influence of different crystallographic orientations on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) remains underexplored [1, 2]. This study employs the transfer matrix method to construct orientation-specific matrices, enabling a systematic investigation of conductance variations under different magnetic and crystallographic conditions. This approach offers a deeper understanding of how crystallographic orientation modulates TMR by developing a framework that adapts the TMM to account for orientation-dependent electronic states and interfacial characteristics [3]. Fundamentally, the TMM represents the partition function for systems with interactions limited to nearest neighbors. It is particularly well-suited for modeling spin-dependent electron tunneling in oriented magnetic tunnel junctions [4, 5].</description>

      <title>A Fluid-Membrane Description of the BTZ Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2+1 dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has proved to be a remarkably efficient tool to test ideas about quantum aspects of gravity and holography. Here, we provide a classical fluid-membrane description of this geometry, both in static and rotating versions, that defines a dynamical viscous Newtonian fluid with non-trivial transport coefficients, mimicking the black hole. The membrane paradigm for black holes in four or more dimensions usually yields fluids with a negative bulk viscosity, which is a problem because it yields decreasing total entropy in thermal processes according to Stokes' hypothesis. However, the (rotating) BTZ black hole has a zero bulk viscosity and is amenable to a physically viable fluid membrane description at thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physics literature about supersymmetry, many authors refer to \emph{super Minkowski spaces}. These spaces are affine supermanifolds with certain distinguished spin structures. In these notes, we make the notion of such spin structures precise and generalise the setup to curved supermanifolds. This leads to the more general notion of \emph{spinorial superspaces}. By working in a suitable geometric and coordinate-free setting, many explicit coordinate computations appearing in physics literature can be replaced by more conceptual methods. As an application of the rather general framework of spinorial superspaces, we formulate $\mathcal N = 1$ super Yang-Mills theories on curved superspaces of spacetime dimensions $d=3$ and $d=4$ and show how to reduce the theory to field theories defined on an underlying ordinary spacetime manifold.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating formulas and bounds in oscillating backgrounds II: Constraints on the spectral index and gravitational dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe's evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</description>

      <title>One-point restricted conformal blocks and the fusion rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-point restriction of the conformal blocks on $(\mathbb{P}^1,\infty, w,0)$ defined by modules over a vertex operator algebra. By restricting the module attached to the point $\infty$ to its bottom degree, we obtain a new formula to calculate fusion rules using a module over the degree-zero Borcherds' Lie algebra. This formula holds under more general assumptions than Frenkel-Zhu's fusion rules theorem. By restricting the module attached to the point $w$ to its bottom degree, we obtain a more general version of Li's nuclear democracy theorem for vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Adding the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula to the algebraic reconstruction theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06361v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A huge progress in studying holographic theories is that holography can be interpreted via the quantum error correction, which makes equal the entanglement wedge reconstruction, the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh formula, the radial commutativity and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We call the equivalence the reconstruction theorem, whose infinite-dimensional generalization via algebraic language was believed to exclude the algebraic version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. However, recent developments regarding gravitational algebras have shown that the inclusion of the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula is plausible. In this letter, we prove that such inclusion holds for the cases of type I/II factors, which are expected to describe holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions to Dirichlet boundary value problems of the stationary relativistic Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Dirichlet boundary value problem of steady-state relativistic Boltzmann equation in half-line with hard potential model, given the data for the outgoing particles at the boundary and a relativistic global Maxwellian with nonzero macroscopic velocities at the far field. We first explicitly address the sound speed for the relativistic Maxwellian in the far field, according to the eigenvalues of an operator based on macro-micro decomposition. Then we demonstrate that the solvability of the problem varies with the Mach number $\mathcal{M}^\infty$. If $\mathcal{M}^\infty&lt;-1$, a unique solution exists connecting the Dirichlet data and the far field Maxwellian when the boundary data is sufficiently close to the Maxwellian. If $\mathcal{M}^\infty&gt;-1$, such a solution exists only if the outgoing boundary data is small and satisfies certain solvability conditions. The proof is based on the macro-micro decomposition of solutions combined with an artificial damping term. A singular in velocity (at $p_1=0$ and $|p|\gg 1$) and spatially exponential decay weight is chosen to carry out the energy estimates. The result extends the previous work [Ukai, Yang, Yu, Comm. Math. Phys. 236, 373-393, 2003] to the relativistic problem.</description>

      <title>Few measurement shots challenge generalization in learning to classify entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to extract general laws from a few known examples depends on the complexity of the problem and on the amount of training data. In the quantum setting, the learner's generalization performance is further challenged by the destructive nature of quantum measurements that, together with the no-cloning theorem, limits the amount of information that can be extracted from each training sample. In this paper we focus on hybrid quantum learning techniques where classical machine-learning methods are paired with quantum algorithms and show that, in some settings, the uncertainty coming from a few measurement shots can be the dominant source of errors. We identify an instance of this possibly general issue by focusing on the classification of maximally entangled vs. separable states, showing that this toy problem becomes challenging for learners unaware of entanglement theory. Finally, we introduce an estimator based on classical shadows that performs better in the big data, few copy regime. Our results show that the naive application of classical machine-learning methods to the quantum setting is problematic, and that a better theoretical foundation of quantum learning is required.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of the geometry in the electronic states of a quantum ripple surface. We have considered an electron governed by the spinless stationary Schr\"{o}dinger equation constrained to move on the ripple surface due to a confining potential from which the Da Costa potential emerges. We investigate the role played by the geometry and orbital angular momentum on the electronic states of the system.</description>

      <title>Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness and long-time behavior of the general Ericksen--Leslie system in 2D under a magnetic field. The PDE system consists of Navier--Stokes equations and kinematic transport equations for the orientations of liquid crystal molecules. For liquid crystal molecules with fixed modulus in torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, we prove the well-posedness of steady-state solutions in order to prove that there exist global strong solutions to the general Ericksen--Leslie system, which are smooth away from the initial time, and the long-time behavior of the solutions is classified according to the $\mathbb{T}^2$ boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Complexity measure of extreme events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity is an important metric for appropriate characterization of different classes of irregular signals, observed in the laboratory or in nature. The literature is already rich in the description of such measures using a variety of entropy and disequilibrium measures, separately or in combination. Chaotic signal was given prime importance in such studies while no such measure was proposed so far, how complex were the extreme events when compared to non-extreme chaos. We address here this question of complexity in extreme events and investigate if we can distinguish them from non-extreme chaotic signal. The normalized Shannon entropy in combination with disequlibrium is used for our study and it is able to distinguish between extreme chaos and non-extreme chaos and moreover, it depicts the transition points from periodic to extremes via Pomeau-Manneville intermittency and, from small amplitude to large amplitude chaos and its transition to extremes via interior crisis. We report a general trend of complexity against a system parameter that increases during a transition to extreme events, reaches a maximum, and then starts decreasing. We employ three models, a nonautonomous Lienard system, 2-dimensional Ikeda map and a 6-dimensional coupled Hindmarh-Rose system to validate our proposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an open quantum system linearly coupled to a bosonic reservoir. We show that, in the ultrastrong coupling limit, the system undergoes a nonselective measurement and then evolves unitarily according to an effective Zeno Hamiltonian. This dynamical process is largely independent of the reservoir state. We examine the entanglement breaking effect of the ultrastrong coupling on the system. We also derive the evolution equation for systems in contact with several reservoirs when one coupling is ultrastrong. The effective system dynamics displays a rich structure and, contrarily to the single reservoir case, it is generally non-Markovian. Our approach is based on a Dyson series expansion, in which we can take the ultrastrong limit termwise, and a subsequent resummation of the series. Our derivation is mathematically rigorous and uncomplicated.</description>

Abstract: Many paintings from the 19th century have exhibited signs of fading and discoloration, often linked to cadmium yellow, a pigment widely used by artists during that time. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of the cadmium sulfide photocatalytic reaction responsible for these damages. By employing non-local integral operators, we capture the interplay between chemical processes and environmental factors, offering a detailed representation of the degradation mechanisms. Furthermore, we present a second order positivity-preserving numerical method designed to accurately simulate the phenomenon and ensure reliable predictions across different scenarios, along with a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the model.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the sine-Gordon kink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the full asymptotic stability of the sine-Gordon kink outside symmetry under small perturbations in weighted Sobolev norms. Our proof consists of a space-time resonances approach based on the distorted Fourier transform to capture modified scattering effects combined with modulation techniques to take into account the invariance under Lorentz transformations and under spatial translations. A major challenge is the slow local decay of the radiation term caused by the threshold resonances of the non-selfadjoint linearized matrix operator around the moving kink. Our analysis crucially relies on two remarkable null structures in the quadratic nonlinearities of the evolution equation for the radiation term and of the modulation equations.
  The entire framework of our proof, including the systematic development of the distorted Fourier theory, is not specific to the sine-Gordon model and extends to many other asymptotic stability problems for moving solitons in relativistic scalar field theories on the line.</description>

      <title>Quantum steering and entanglement for coupled systems: exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Wigner function in phase space, we study quantum steering and entanglement between two coupled harmonic oscillators. We derive expressions for purity and quantum steering in both directions and identify several important selection rules. Our results extend the work reported in {\color{blue} [Phys. Rev. E 97, 042203 (2018)]} focused on the weak coupling regime, revealing significant deviations in the ultra-strong coupling regime. In particular, Makarov's prediction of a separable ground state contrasts with our exact calculations, highlighting the limitations of his approach under strong coupling conditions. We show that quantum steering between excited oscillators is completely absent even in the ultra-strong coupling regime. Similarly, resonant oscillators have no steering, and ground states cannot steer any receiver state. We find that quantum steering becomes notably more pronounced as the system approaches resonance and within specific ranges of ultra-strong coupling. This behavior is marked by a clear asymmetry, where steering is present in only one direction, highlighting the delicate balance of interaction strengths that govern the emergence of quantum correlations. These results advance our understanding of how excitation levels and coupling strengths influence quantum steering and entanglement in coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space over the plane with the maximum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $p$-Wasserstein spaces over the branching spaces $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $[0,1]^2$ equipped with the maximum norm metric. We show that these spaces are isometrically rigid for all $p\geq1,$ meaning that all isometries of these spaces are induced by isometries of the underlying space via the push-forward operation. This is in contrast to the case of the Euclidean metric since with that distance the $2$-Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not rigid. Also, we highlight that $1$-Wasserstein space is not rigid over the interval $[0,1]$, while according to our result, its two-dimensional analog with the more complicated geodesic structure is rigid. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first ones concerning the structure of isometries of Wasserstein spaces over branching spaces. Accordingly, our proof techniques substantially deviate from those used for non-branching underlying spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use operators from generalized equiangular measurements to construct positive maps. Their positivity follows from the inequality for indices of coincidence corresponding to few equiangular tight frames. These maps give rise to entanglement witnesses, which include as special cases many important classes considered in the literature. Additionally, we introduce separability criteria based on the correlation matrix and analyze them for various types of measurements.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Circulating Currents in Electric Machines: Positive Impact of The End Windings Length on Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circulating currents occurring in windings of electric machines received rising interest recent years. Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length. The aim of this paper is to mathematically prove this property and present a case study application in an electric machine.</description>

      <title>A matrix model of a non-Hermitian $\beta$-ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first random matrix model of a complex $\beta$-ensemble. The matrices are tridiagonal and can be thought of as the non-Hermitian analogue of the Hermite $\beta$-ensembles discovered by Dumitriu and Edelman (J. Math. Phys., Vol. 43, 5830 (2002)). The main feature of the model is that the exponent $\beta$ of the Vandermonde determinant in the joint probability density function (j.p.d.f.) of the eigenvalues can take any value in $\mathbb{R}_+$. However, when $\beta=2$, the j.p.d.f. does not reduce to that of the Ginibre ensemble, but it contains an extra factor expressed as a multidimensional integral over the space of the eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Some exact Green function solutions for non-linear classical field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider some non-linear non-homogeneous partial differential equations (PDEs) and derive their exact Green function solution as a functional Taylor expansion in powers of the source. The kind of PDEs we consider are dispersive ones where the exact solution of the corresponding homogeneous equations can have some known shape. The technique has a formal similarity with the Dyson--Schwinger set of equations to solve quantum field theories. However, there are no physical constraints. Indeed, we show that a complete coincidence with the statistical field model of a quartic scalar theory can be achieved in the Gaussian expansion of the cumulants of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Baker-Akhiezer function for the deformed root system $BC(l,1)$ and bispectrality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a Sergeev-Veselov difference operator of rational Macdonald-Ruijsenaars (MR) type for the deformed root system $BC(l,1)$ preserves a ring of quasi-invariants in the case of non-negative integer values of the multiplicity parameters. We prove that in this case the operator admits a (multidimensional) Baker-Akhiezer eigenfunction, which depends on spectral parameters and which is, moreover, as a function of the spectral variables an eigenfunction for the (trigonometric) generalised Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) Hamiltonian for $BC(l,1)$. By an analytic continuation argument, we generalise this eigenfunction also to the case of more general complex values of the multiplicities. This leads to a bispectral duality statement for the corresponding MR and CMS systems of type $BC(l,1)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a third order operator under the three-point Dirichlet condition. Its spectrum is the so-called auxiliary spectrum for the good Boussinesq equation, as well as the Dirichlet spectrum for the Schr\"odinger operator on the unit interval is the auxiliary spectrum for the periodic KdV equation. The auxiliary spectrum is formed by projections of the points of the divisor onto the spectral plane. We estimate the spectrum and the corresponding norming constants in terms of small operator coefficients. This work is the first in a series of papers devoted to solving the inverse problem for the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>CLT for real beta-ensembles at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem for the fluctuations of the linear statistics in the $\beta$-ensemble of dimension $N$ at a temperature proportional to $N$ and with confining smooth potential. In this regime, the particles do not accumulate in a compact set as in the fixed $\beta&gt;0$ case which results in an equilibrium measure supported on the whole real line. The space of test functions for which the CLT holds includes bounded $C^2$ functions. The method that we use is based on a change of variables in the partition function introduced in Johansson [1998] and allows to deduce the convergence of the Laplace transform of the recentred linear statistics towards the Laplace transform of the normal distribution. It is obtained by the inversion of the master operator, which is the main contribution of the present paper, by following the scheme developed in Hardy, Lambert [2019] in the compact case. In the high-temperature regime, the master operator contains an additional differential term due to entropic effects which makes it an unbounded operator. The techniques used in this article involve Schr\"odinger operators theory as well as concentration of measure.</description>

Abstract: We use methods from algebra and discrete geometry to study the irreducibility of the dispersion polynomial of a discrete periodic operator associated to a periodic graph after changing the period lattice. We provide numerous applications of these results to discrete periodic operators associated to families of graphs which include dense periodic graphs, and a family containing the hexagonal and diamond lattices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological phases, conformal criticalities, and duality in exactly solvable SO($n$) spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of SO($n$)-symmetric spin chains which generalize the transverse-field Ising chain for $n=1$. These spin chains are defined with Gamma matrices and can be exactly solved by mapping to $n$ species of itinerant Majorana fermions coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Their phase diagrams include a critical point described by the $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_{1}$ conformal field theory as well as two distinct gapped phases. We show that one of the gapped phases is a trivial phase and the other realizes a symmetry-protected topological phase when $n \geq 2$. These two gapped phases are proved to be related to each other by a Kramers-Wannier duality. Furthermore, other elegant structures in the transverse-field Ising chain, such as the infinite-dimensional Onsager algebra, also carry over to our models.</description>

      <title>SLE partition functions via conformal welding of random surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SLE curves describe the scaling limit of interfaces from many 2D lattice models. Heuristically speaking, the SLE partition function is the continuum counterpart of the partition function of the corresponding discrete model. It is well known that conformally welding of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces gives SLE curves as the interfaces. In this paper, we demonstrate in several settings how the SLE partition function arises from conformal welding of LQG surfaces. The common theme is that we conformally weld a collection of canonical LQG surfaces which produces a topological configuration with more than one conformal structure. Conditioning on the conformal moduli, the surface after welding is described by Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT), and the density of the random moduli contains the SLE partition function for the interfaces as a multiplicative factor. The settings we treat includes the multiple SLE for $\kappa\in (0,4)$, the flow lines of imaginary geometry on the disk with boundary marked points, and the boundary Green function. These results demonstrate an alternative approach to construct and study the SLE partition function, which complements the traditional method based on stochastic calculus and differential equation.</description>

      <title>Mean Values and Quantum Variance for Degenerate Eisenstein Series of Higher Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mean value of the inner product of squared $\mathrm{GL}_{n}$ degenerate maximal parabolic Eisenstein series against a smooth compactly supported function lying in a restricted space of incomplete Eisenstein series induced from a $\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ Hecke-Maass cusp form $\varphi$. Our result breaks the fundamental threshold with a polynomial power-saving beyond the pointwise implications of the generalised Lindel\"{o}f hypothesis for $L$-functions attached to $\varphi$. Furthermore, we evaluate the archimedean quantum variance and establish approximate orthogonality, expanding upon Zhang's (2019) work on quantum unique ergodicity for $\mathrm{GL}_{n}$ degenerate maximal parabolic Eisenstein series as well as Huang's (2021) work on quantum variance for $\mathrm{GL}_{2}$ Eisenstein series. Despite the theoretical strength of these manifestations, our argument relies exclusively on the Watson-Ichino-type formula for incomplete Eisenstein series of type $(2, 1, \ldots, 1)$ and Jutila's (1996) asymptotic formula for the second moment of $L$-functions attached to $\varphi$ in long intervals, supplemented by a standard analytical toolbox.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of KPZ limits arising from directed random walk models in random media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalized model of random walk in dynamical random environment, and we show that the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation (SHE) describes the fluctuations of the quenched density at a certain precise location in the tail. The distribution of transition kernels is fixed rather than changing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time, i.e., there is no critical tuning of the model parameters when scaling to the stochastic PDE limit. The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279, arXiv 2311.09151] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise in a wide variety of random walk models in random media. In particular we are able to get rid of conditions such as nearest-neighbor interaction as well as spatial independence of quenched transition kernels. Moreover, we observe an entire hierarchy of moderate deviation exponents at which the SHE can be found, confirming a physics prediction of J. Hass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extension of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle to ensemble states $\rho_{\mathbf{w}}\equiv\sum_k w_k |\Psi_k\rangle \langle\Psi_k|$ with fixed weights $w_k$ lies ultimately at the heart of several recent methodological developments for targeting excitation energies by variational means. Prominent examples are density and density matrix functional theory, Monte Carlo sampling, state-average complete active space self-consistent field methods and variational quantum eigensolvers. In order to provide a sound basis for all these methods and to improve their current implementations, we prove the validity of the underlying critical hypothesis: Whenever the ensemble energy is well-converged, the same holds true for the ensemble state $\rho_{\mathbf{w}}$ as well as the individual eigenstates $|\Psi_k\rangle$ and eigenenergies $E_k$. To be more specific, we derive linear bounds $d_-\Delta{E}_{\mathbf{w}} \leq \Delta Q \leq d_+ \Delta{E}_{\mathbf{w}}$ on the errors $\Delta Q $ of these sought-after quantities. A subsequent analytical analysis and numerical illustration proves the tightness of our universal inequalities. Our results and particularly the explicit form of $d_{\pm}\equiv d_{\pm}^{(Q)}(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{E})$ provide valuable insights into the optimal choice of the auxiliary weights $w_k$ in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A uniqueness theory on determining the nonlinear energy potential in phase-field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase-field system is a nonlinear model that has significant applications in material sciences. In this paper, we are concerned with the uniqueness of determining the nonlinear energy potential in a phase-field system consisting of Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations. This system finds widespread applications in the development of alloys engineered to withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. The goal is to reconstruct the nonlinear energy potential through the measurements of concentration fields. We establish the local well-posedness of the phase-field system based on the implicit function theorem in Banach spaces. Both of the uniqueness results for recovering time-independent and time-dependent energy potential functions are provided through the higher order linearization technique.</description>

      <title>Stability of slow Hamiltonian dynamics from Lieb-Robinson bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <title>Inevitable Negativity: Additivity Commands Negative Quantum Channel Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channels represent a broad spectrum of operations crucial to quantum information theory, encompassing everything from the transmission of quantum information to the manipulation of various resources. In the domain of states, the concept of majorization serves as a fundamental tool for comparing the uncertainty inherent in both classical and quantum systems. This paper establishes a rigorous framework for assessing the uncertainty in both classical and quantum channels. By employing a specific class of superchannels, we introduce and elucidate three distinct approaches to channel majorization: constructive, axiomatic, and operational. Intriguingly, these methodologies converge to a consistent ordering. This convergence not only provides a robust basis for defining entropy functions for channels but also clarifies the interpretation of entropy in this broader context. Most notably, our findings reveal that any viable entropy function for quantum channels must assume negative values, thereby challenging traditional notions of entropy.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal theory of linear instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion, and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation with Space Contributions Embedded in a Quantum-Corrected Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac equation is considered with the recently proposed generalized gravitational interaction (Kepler or Coulomb), which includes post-Newtonian (relativistic) and quantum corrections to the classical potential. The general idea in choosing the metric is that the spacetime contributions are contained in an external potential or in an electromagnetic potential which can be considered as a good basis for future studies of quantum physics in space. The forms considered for the scalar potential and the so-called vector (magnetic) potential, can be viewed as the multipole expansion of these terms and therefore the approach includes a simultaneous study of multipole expansions to both fields. We also discuss several known generalizations of the Coulomb potential within this formulation in terms of certain Heun functions. The impossibility of solving our equation for the quantum-corrected Coulomb terms using known exact or quasi-exact nonperturbative analytical techniques is discussed, and finally the Bethe-ansatz approach is proposed to overcome this challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Optical response of alternating twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the optical response of the alternating twisted trilayer graphene by making use of a unitary transformation for the trilayer Hamiltonian and the Kubo formulation of linear response theory. The layer-resolved optical conductivities are expressed in terms of contributions from effective twisted bilayer and single-layer systems along with their coupling. We show that the in-plane magnetic response is proportional to this coupling between the twisted bilayer and single-layer systems; and, due to the different energy scales, the in-plane magnetic response is negligibly small. We also formulate a local electro-magnetic response that involves the vertical gradients of the magnetic field and moment.</description>

      <title>On the Limit of the Tridiagonal Model for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, a description of the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E random matrix is provided by Edelman and Dumitriu. The resulting tridiagonal ensemble makes sense for all $\beta&gt;0$, and has spectrum given by the $\beta$-ensemble for all $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, the tridiagonal model has useful stochastic operator limits which was introduced and analyzed in subsequent studies.
  In this work, we analogously study the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E process which has eigenvalues governed by $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion. We propose an explicit limit of the upper left $k \times k$ minor of the $n \times n$ tridiagonal process as $n \to \infty$ and $k$ remains fixed. We prove the result for $\beta=1$, and also provide numerical evidence for $\beta=1,2,4$. This leads us to conjecture the form of a dynamical $\beta$-stochastic Airy operator with smallest $k$ eigenvalues evolving according to the $n \to \infty$ limit of the largest, centered and re-scaled, $k$ eigenvalues of $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>On properties of Schmidt Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schmidt decomposition is a powerful tool in quantum information. While Schmidt decomposition is universal for bipartite states, its not for multipartite states. In this article, we review properties of bipartite Schmidt decompositions and study which of them extend to multipartite states. In particular, Schmidt number (the number of non-zero terms in Schmidt decomposition) define an equivalence class using separable unitary transforms. We show that it is NP-complete to partition a multipartite state that attains the highest Schmidt number. In addition, we observe that purifications of a density matrix of a composite system preserves Schmidt decomposability.</description>
