      <title>Exploration of Embodied Space Experience through Umbilical Interaction: A Grounded Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper critiques the limits of human-centered design in HCI, proposing a shift toward Interface-Centered Design. Drawing on Hookway's philosophy of interfaces, phenomenology, and embodied interaction, we created Umbilink, an umbilical interaction device simulating a uterine environment with tactile sensors and rhythmic feedback to induce a pre-subjectivized state of sensory reduction. Participants' experiences were captured through semi-structured interviews and analyzed with grounded theory. Our contributions are: (1) introducing the novel interface type of Umbilical Interaction; (2) demonstrating the cognitive value of materialized interfaces in a human-interface-environment relation; (3) highlighting the design role of wearing rituals as liminal experiences. As a pilot study, this design suggests imaginative applications in healing, meditation, and sleep, while offering a speculative tool for future interface research.</description>

      <title>Expanding detection bandwidth via a photonic reservoir for ultrafast optical sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of ultrafast optical and radio-frequency (RF) signals is crucial for applications ranging from high-speed communications to advanced sensing. However, conventional detectors are fundamentally constrained by their intrinsic bandwidth, limiting accurate broadband signal measurement. Here, we show that a neuromorphic photonic processing approach can overcome this limitation, enabling accurate broadband signal detection beyond the detector bandwidth. The key idea lies in the spatiotemporal encoding of input waveforms within a photonic reservoir network, which reconstructs high-frequency components otherwise inaccessible to individual detectors. We experimentally demonstrate the detection of high-speed optical phase signals with more than an eightfold effective bandwidth expansion using an on-chip silicon photonic reservoir. This approach provides a scalable and integrable platform for high-speed optical and RF signal processing, opening new opportunities in ultrafast photonics and next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Role of Communication in Modular Multi-Core Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalability of quantum computing is constrained by the physical and architectural limitations of monolithic quantum processors. Modular multi-core quantum architectures, which interconnect multiple quantum cores (QCs) via classical and quantum-coherent links, offer a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, transitioning to a modular architecture introduces communication overhead, where classical communication plays a crucial role in executing quantum algorithms by transmitting measurement outcomes and synchronizing operations across QCs. Understanding the impact of classical communication on execution time is therefore essential for optimizing system performance.
  In this work, we introduce \qcomm, an open-source simulator designed to evaluate the role of classical communication in modular quantum computing architectures. \qcomm{} provides a high-level execution and timing model that captures the interplay between quantum gate execution, entanglement distribution, teleportation protocols, and classical communication latency. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis to quantify the impact of classical communication bandwidth, interconnect types, and quantum circuit mapping strategies on overall execution time. Furthermore, we assess classical communication overhead when executing real quantum benchmarks mapped onto a cryogenically-controlled multi-core quantum system. Our results show that, while classical communication is generally not the dominant contributor to execution time, its impact becomes increasingly relevant in optimized scenarios -- such as improved quantum technology, large-scale interconnects, or communication-aware circuit mappings. These findings provide useful insights for the design of scalable modular quantum architectures and highlight the importance of evaluating classical communication as a performance-limiting factor in future systems.</description>

      <title>Large-Area Fabrication-Aware Computational Diffractive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable optics, as an emerging paradigm that jointly optimizes optics and (optional) image processing algorithms, has made innovative optical designs possible across a broad range of applications. Many of these systems utilize diffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or wavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited to laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and manufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to the practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we propose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated by direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication, which is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs. We propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately predict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process. This model can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable optics frameworks, enabling fabrication-aware, end-to-end optimization of computational optical systems. To tackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute framework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many GPUs. As such, we demonstrate large scale diffractive optics designs up to 32.16 mm $\times$ 21.44 mm, simulated on grids of up to 128,640 by 85,760 feature points. We find adequate agreement between simulation and fabricated prototypes for applications such as holography and PSF engineering. We also achieve high image quality from an imaging system comprised only of a single DOE, with images processed only by a Wiener filter utilizing the simulation PSF. We believe our findings lift the fabrication limitations for real-world applications of diffractive optics and differentiable optical design.</description>

      <title>A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization.
  We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Learned Display Radiance Fields with Lensless Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibrating displays is a basic and regular task that content creators must perform to maintain optimal visual experience, yet it remains a troublesome issue. Measuring display characteristics from different viewpoints often requires specialized equipment and a dark room, making it inaccessible to most users. To avoid specialized hardware requirements in display calibrations, our work co-designs a lensless camera and an Implicit Neural Representation based algorithm for capturing display characteristics from various viewpoints. More specifically, our pipeline enables efficient reconstruction of light fields emitted from a display from a viewing cone of 46.6{\deg} X 37.6{\deg}. Our emerging pipeline paves the initial steps towards effortless display calibration and characterization.</description>

      <title>Clustering Deposit and Withdrawal Activity in Tornado Cash: A Cross-Chain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tornado Cash is a decentralised mixer that uses cryptographic techniques to sever the on-chain trail between depositors and withdrawers. In practice, however, its anonymity can be undermined by user behaviour and operational quirks. We conduct the first cross-chain empirical study of Tornado Cash activity on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon, introducing three clustering heuristics-(i) address-reuse, (ii) transactional-linkage, and (iii) a novel first-in-first-out (FIFO) temporal-matching rule. Together, these heuristics reconnect deposits to withdrawals and deanonymise a substantial share of recipients. Our analysis shows that 5.1 - 12.6% of withdrawals can already be traced to their originating deposits through address reuse and transactional linkage heuristics. Adding our novel First-In-First-Out (FIFO) temporal-matching heuristic lifts the linkage rate by a further 15 - 22 percentage points. Statistical tests confirm that these FIFO matches are highly unlikely to occur by chance. Comparable leakage across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon indicates chain-agnostic user misbehaviour, rather than chain-specific protocol flaws. These results expose how quickly cryptographic guarantees can unravel in everyday use, underscoring the need for both disciplined user behaviour and privacy-aware protocol design. In total, our heuristics link over $2.3 billion in Tornado Cash withdrawals to identifiable deposits, exposing significant cracks in practical anonymity.</description>
