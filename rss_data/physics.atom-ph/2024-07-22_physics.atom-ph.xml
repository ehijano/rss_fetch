      <title>Measurement of Casimir-Polder interaction for slow atoms through a material grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method utilizing atomic diffraction patterns and statistical analysis tools to infer the Casimir-Polder interaction between Argon atoms and a silicon nitride nanograting. The quantum model that supports the data is investigated in detail, as are the roles of nanograting geometry, finite size effects, slit width opening angles, and Lennard-Jones potentials. Our findings indicate that the atom-surface potential strength parameter is C3 = 6.87 $\pm$ 1.18 meV.nm3. This value is primarily constrained by the knowledge of the nanograting geometry. The high sensitivity of our method paves the way for precise determination of the Casimir-Polder potential and exploration of new short-distance forces.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dependence in multiphoton ionization and attosecond time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond ionization time-delays at photoelectron energies above typically 10 eV are usually interpreted using the so called asymptotic approximation as a sum of the atomic or molecular delays with a universal laser-induced contribution. Here, we employ a two-harmonic RABITT (Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating by Interference of Two-photon Transitions) configuration to isolate the multiphoton pathways and measure the ionization time delays as a function of the dressing field intensity. We show that the validity of the asymptotic theory can be extended to the threshold or to higher-order contributions by rigorously treating the angular-momentum dependence of the continuum-continuum transitions into universal and easily computable partial-wave-specific correction factors. Our asymptotic treatment is also valid for higher-order interfering amplitudes while significantly simplifying their evaluation and providing a transparent physical interpretation. The validity of the method for atomic and molecular targets in the vicinity of resonances, ionization thresholds, and for both the emission-integrated and angularly resolved signal is confirmed by comparison to ab initio calculations over a wide energy range.</description>

      <title>Circular Dichroism in Multiphoton Ionization of Resonantly Excited Helium Ions near Channel Closing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular dichroism (CD) of photoelectrons generated by near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses using multiphoton ionization of excited He^+ ions, which were prepared in the (3p,m=+1) state by circularly polarized extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses, is examined experimentally and theoretically. A complex variation of the CD is observed as a result of intensity- and polarization-dependent Freeman resonances for circularly polarized NIR pulses co- and counter-rotating relative to the polarization of the XUV pulse, with and without additional dichroic AC-Stark shifts. The experimental results are compared with numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to identify and interpret the pronounced variation of the experimentally observed CD.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global Magnetometer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis method to search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated during large energy astrophysical events such as supernovae, binary black hole or binary neutron star mergers, and fast radio bursts using the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME). In our model, the associated gravitational waves or electromagnetic signals herald the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts via coupling to the spin of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multi-messenger astronomy. The algorithm employs a model-agnostic excess-power method to identify network-wide candidate events to be subjected to a model-dependent generalized likelihood-ratio test to determine their statistical significance. We perform the first search with this technique on GNOME data coincident with the binary black hole merger S200311bg detected by LIGO/Virgo on the 11th of March 2020 and find no significant events. We place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimized surface ion trap design for tight confinement and separation of ion chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit systems based on trapped ultracold ions win one of the leading positions in the quantum computing field, demonstrating quantum algorithms with the highest complexity to date. Surface Paul traps for ion confinement open the opportunity to scale quantum processors to hundreds of qubits and enable high-connectivity manipulations on ions. To fabricate such a system with certain characteristics, the special design of a surface electrode structure is required. The depth of the trapping potential, the stability parameter, the secular frequency and the distance between an ion and the trap surface should be optimized for better performance. Here we present the optimized design of a relatively simple surface trap that allows several important high-fidelity primitives: tight ion confinement, laser cooling, and wide optical access. The suggested trap design also allows to perform an important basic operation, namely, splitting an ion chain into two parts.</description>

      <title>Pseudoatom Molecular Dynamics Plasma Microfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral line profiles are powerful diagnostic tools for both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, as their shape is sensitive to the plasma environment. The low-frequency component of the electric microfield is an important input for analytic line broadening codes. In this paper we detail a new method of calculating plasma microfields using configuration-resolved pseudoatom molecular dynamics. This approach accounts for both quantum atomic structure and N-body effects, similar to density functional theory molecular dynamics, but with less computational cost. We present pseudoatom microfields at conditions relevant for recent laboratory experiments. Compared to established microfield codes we find moderate deviations at solid density conditions and strong agreement at lower plasma densities.</description>

      <title>Simulations of evaporation to deep Fermi degeneracy in microwave-shielded molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest toward realizing novel quantum matter in ultracold molecular gases, we perform a numerical study of evaporative cooling in ultracold gases of microwave-shielded polar fermionic molecules. Our Monte Carlo simulations incorporate accurate two-body elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections, realistic modeling of the optical dipole trap, and the influence of Pauli blocking at low temperatures. The simulations are benchmarked against data from evaporation studies performed with ultracold NaK molecules, showing excellent agreement. We further explore the prospects for optimizing the evaporation efficiency by varying the ramp rate and duration of the evaporation trajectory. Our simulation shows that it is possible to reach $&lt; 10\%$ of the Fermi temperature under optimal conditions even in the presence of two-body molecular losses.</description>

      <title>Interferometry of non-Abelian band singularities and Euler class topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems with a real Bloch Hamiltonian band nodes can be characterised by a non-Abelian frame-rotation charge. The ability of these band nodes to annihilate pairwise is path dependent, since by braiding nodes in adjacent gaps the sign of their charges can be changed. Here, we theoretically construct and numerically confirm two concrete methods to experimentally probe these non-Abelian braiding processes and charges in ultracold atomic systems. We consider a coherent superposition of two bands that can be created by moving atoms through the band singularities at some angle in momentum space. Analyzing the dependency of excitations on the frame charges, we demonstrate an interferometry scheme passing through two band nodes, which reveals the relative frame charges and allows for measuring the multi-gap topological invariant. The second method relies on a single wavepacket probing two nodes sequentially, where the frame charges can be determined from the band populations. Our results present a feasible avenue for measuring non-Abelian charges of band nodes and the direct experimental verification of braiding procedures, which can be applied in a variety of settings including the recently discovered anomalous non-Abelian phases arising under periodic driving.</description>

      <title>Creation of a tweezer array for cold atoms utilizing a generative neural network</title>

Abstract: Optical tweezers have become essential tools for dynamically manipulating objects, ranging from microspheres or biological molecules to neutral atoms. In this study, we demonstrate the creation of tweezer arrays using a generative neural network, which allows for the trapping of neutral atoms with tunable atom arrays. We have successfully loaded cold strontium atoms into various optical tweezer patterns generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) integrated with generative models. Our approach shortens the process time to control the SLM wtih minimal time delay, eliminating the need for repeated re-optimization of the hologram for the SLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency dependence of (nonsequential) double ionization is studied in fully quantum mechanical calculations using a (1+1)-dimensional model atom. Other time-dependent effects such as the influence of the number of field cycles are also investigated. We present ionization yields and momentum distributions. The results are consistent with experimental and semi-classical data available in the literature, thus complementing them with a quantum mechanical description.</description>
