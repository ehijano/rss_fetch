      <title>Bridging DNP and MAS NMR dipolar recoupling -- from static single crystal to spinning powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17288v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin engineering of advanced pulse sequences has had a transformative impact on the development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, to an extending degree also electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and the hybrid between the two, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Based on a simple formalism, we demonstrate that (i) single-crystal static-sample optimisations may tremendously ease design of experiments for rotating powders and (ii) pulse sequences may readily be exchanged between these distinct spectroscopies. Specifically, we design broadband heteronuclear solid-state NMR magic-angle-spinning (MAS) dipolar recoupling experiments based on the recently developed PLATO (PoLarizAtion Transfer via non-linear Optimization) microwave (MW) pulse sequence optimized on a single crystal for powder static-sample DNP. Using this concept, we demonstrate design of ultra-broadband 13C-15N and 2H-13C cross-polarization experiments, using PLATO on the 13C radio-frequency (RF) channel and square/ramped or RESPIRATION (Rotor Echo Short Pulse IRrAdiaTION) RF irradiation on the 15N and 2H RF channels, respectively.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-motion internally contracted multireference unitary coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate computation of excited states remains a challenge in electronic structure theory, especially for systems with a ground state that requires a multireference treatment. In this work, we introduce a novel equation-of-motion (EOM) extension of the internally contracted multireference unitary coupled-cluster framework (ic-MRUCC), termed EOM-ic-MRUCC. EOM-ic-MRUCC follows the transform-then-diagonalize approach, in analogy to its non-unitary counterpart [Datta and Nooijen, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 204107 (2012)]. By employing a projective approach to optimize the ground state, the method retains additive separability and proper scaling with system size. We show that excitation energies are size intensive if the EOM operator satisfies the "killer" and the projective conditions. Furthermore, we propose to represent changes in reference state upon electron excitation via projected many-body operators that span active orbitals and show that the EOM equations formulated in this way are invariant with respect to active orbital rotations. We test the EOM-ic-MRUCC method truncated to single and double excitations by computing the potential energy curves for several excited states of a BeH$_2$ model system, the HF molecule, and water undergoing symmetric dissociation. Across these systems, our method delivers accurate excitation energies and potential energy curves within 5 m$E_\mathrm{h}$ (ca. 0.14 eV) from full configuration interaction. We find that truncating the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series to four-fold commutators contributes negligible errors (on the order of $10^{-5}$ $E_\mathrm{h}$ or less), offering a practical route to highly accurate excited-state calculations with reduced computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Phase-Incremented, Steady-State Solution NMR: Maximizing Spectral Sensitivity Without Compromising Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NMR acquisitions based on Ernst-angle excitations are widely used in analytical spectroscopy, as for over half a century they have been considered the optimal way for maximizing spectral sensitivity without compromising bandwidth or peak resolution. However, if as often happens in liquid state NMR relaxation times T1, T2 are long and similar, steady-state free-precession (SSFP) experiments can actually provide higher signal-to-noise ratios per square root of acquisition time (SNRt) than Ernst-angle-based counterparts. Although a strong offset dependence and a requirement for pulsing at repetition times TR &lt;&lt; T2 leading to poor spectral resolution have impeded widespread analytical applications of SSFP, phase-incremented (PI) SSFP schemes could overcome these drawbacks. The present study explores if, when and how, can this approach to high resolution NMR improve SNRt over the performance afforded by Ernst-angle-based FT acquisitions. It is found that PI-SSFP can indeed often provide a superior SNRt than FT-NMR, but that achieving this requires implementing the acquisitions using relatively large flip angles. As also explained, however, this can restrict PI-SSFP's spectral resolution, and lead to distorted line shapes. To deal with this problem we introduce here a new outlook on SSFP experiments that can overcome this dichotomy, and lead to high spectral resolution even when utilizing relatively the large flip angles that provide optimal sensitivity. This new outlook also leads to a processing pipeline for PI-SSFP acquisitions, which is here introduced and exemplified. The enhanced SNRt that the ensuing method can provide over FT-based NMR counterparts collected under Ernst-angle excitation conditions, is examined with a series of 13C and 15N natural abundance investigations on organic compounds.</description>

      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>

      <title>Ion-kinetic-energy sampling in a 22-pole trap using ring-electrode evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental method for the characterization of the kinetic energies of ions confined in a 22-pole radio frequency trap by inducing a small potential barrier using the surrounding ring electrodes, allowing the selective extraction of ions. Energy sampling experiments have been performed on buffer gas thermalized He$^+$ ions at trap temperatures between 10-180 K, resulting in distinct extraction curves as a function of the potential barrier, and a differentiated behavior depending on the escape time from the trap. The experiments are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations of the ion trajectories inside the calculated trap potential and allow us to investigate the properties of the sampling method, the role of ion motion coupling, and the impact of residual buffer gas collisions on the observed results. The technique has also been successfully applied to identify energetic H$_3^+$ ions produced in an exothermic reaction inside the trap. Upon calibration, this method can provide relative kinetic energy distributions or be used to filter the maximum desired kinetic energy of the ions inside the trap.</description>

      <title>Intermittent molecular motion and first passage statistics for the NMR relaxation of confined water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of fluids confined in nanoporous media differ from those in bulk, which can be probed using NMR relaxation measurements. We here show, using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of water in a slit nanopore, that the behavior of the NMR relaxation rate, R1, with varying surface interaction and confinement strength can be estimated from the exchange statistics of fluid molecules between the adsorbed surface layer and the bulk region, where molecules undergo intermittent dynamics. We employ first return passage time calculations to quantify the molecular exchange statistics, thereby linking microscopic parameters of the confined fluid-such as adsorption time, pore size, and diffusion coefficient-to the NMR relaxation rate. This approach allows to predict and interpret the molecular relaxation of fluids at interfaces using merely concepts of statistical mechanics and can be generalized to closed and open geometries.</description>

      <title>MACE-OFF: Transferable Short Range Machine Learning Force Fields for Organic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical empirical force fields have dominated biomolecular simulation for over 50 years. Although widely used in drug discovery, crystal structure prediction, and biomolecular dynamics, they generally lack the accuracy and transferability required for first-principles predictive modeling. In this paper, we introduce MACE-OFF, a series of short range transferable force fields for organic molecules created using state-of-the-art machine learning technology and first-principles reference data computed with a high level of quantum mechanical theory. MACE-OFF demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of short range models by accurately predicting a wide variety of gas and condensed phase properties of molecular systems. It produces accurate, easy-to-converge dihedral torsion scans of unseen molecules, as well as reliable descriptions of molecular crystals and liquids, including quantum nuclear effects. We further demonstrate the capabilities of MACE-OFF by determining free energy surfaces in explicit solvent, as well as the folding dynamics of peptides.Finally, we simulate a fully solvated small protein, observing accurate secondary structure and vibrational spectrum. These developments enable first-principles simulations of molecular systems for the broader chemistry community at high accuracy and relatively low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Beyond CCSD(T) accuracy at lower scaling with auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a black-box auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach to perform highly accurate electronic structure calculations using configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) trial states. This method consistently provides more accurate energy estimates than coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), often regarded as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. This level of precision is achieved at a lower asymptotic computational cost, scaling as $O(N^6)$ compared to the $O(N^7)$ scaling of CCSD(T). We provide numerical evidence supporting these findings through results for challenging main group and transition metal-containing molecules.</description>

      <title>Generalizable, Fast, and Accurate DeepQSPR with fastprop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02058v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Structure Property Relationship studies aim to define a mapping between molecular structure and arbitrary quantities of interest. This was historically accomplished via the development of descriptors which requires significant domain expertise and struggles to generalize. Thus the field has morphed into Molecular Property Prediction and been given over to learned representations which are highly generalizable. The paper introduces fastprop, a DeepQSPR framework which uses a cogent set of molecular level descriptors to meet and exceed the performance of learned representations on diverse datasets in dramatically less time. fastprop is freely available on github at github.com/JacksonBurns/fastprop.</description>

      <title>Machine learning Hubbard parameters with equivariant neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$) provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.</description>

      <title>Temporal reversibility of reactive systems out of equilibrium: Molecular dynamics simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy production in macroscopic systems is non-negative, reaching zero only at thermodynamic equilibrium. As a corollary, this implies that the state trajectory of macroscopic systems is inherently time-irreversible under out-of-equilibrium conditions. However, over the past half-century, various studies have shown that this principle does not universally apply to the composition sample paths of certain isothermal reactive systems. Theoretical frameworks leading to this surprising observation primarily focus on perfectly homogeneous systems (often referred to as zero-dimensional systems), which inherently exclude the effects of local fluctuations. This oversimplification may account for the paradoxical theoretical predictions. In the absence of relevant experimental data, this paper seeks to explore this phenomenon through microscopic simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Metal-Support Interaction Dictates Cu Nanoparticle Sintering on Al$_2$O$_3$ Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticle sintering remains a critical challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we present a unified deep potential (DP) model for Cu nanoparticles on three Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces ($\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100), $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110), and $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001)). Using DP-accelerated simulations, we reveal striking facet-dependent nanoparticle stability and mobility patterns across the three surfaces. The nanoparticles diffuse several times faster on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) than on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) at 800 K while expected to be more sluggish based on their larger binding energy at 0 K. Diffusion is facilitated by dynamic metal-support interaction (MSI), where the Al atoms switch out of the surface plane to optimize contact with the nanoparticle and relax back to the plane as the nanoparticle moves away. In contrast, the MSI on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) and on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110) is dominated by more stable and directional Cu-O bonds, consistent with the limited diffusion observed on these surfaces. Our extended long-time MD simulations provide quantitative insights into the sintering processes, showing that the dispersity of nanoparticles (the initial inter-nanoparticle distance) strongly influences coalescence driven by nanoparticle diffusion. We observed that the coalescence of Cu$_{13}$ nanoparticles on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) can occur in a short time (10 ns) at 800 K even with an initial inter-nanoparticle distance increased to 30 \r{A}, while the coalescence on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) is inhibited significantly by increasing the initial inter-nanoparticle distance from 15 \r{A} to 30 \r{A}. These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of the supporting surface is crucial to understanding the sintering mechanism and offer guidance for designing sinter-resistant catalysts by engineering the support morphology.</description>

      <title>Protecting Intercavity Polaritons in Strongly Coupled Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</description>
