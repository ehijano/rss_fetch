      <title>Impact Evaluation on the European Privacy Laws governing generative-AI models -- Evidence in Relation between Internet Censorship and the Ban of ChatGPT in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proceed an impact evaluation on the European Privacy Laws governing generative-AI models, especially, focusing on the effects of the Ban of ChatGPT in Italy. We investigate on the causal relationship between Internet Censorship Data and the Ban of ChatGPT in Italy during the period from March 27, 2023 to April 11, 2023. We analyze the relation based on the hidden Markov model with Poisson emissions. We find out that the HTTP Invalid Requests, which decreased during those period, can be explained with seven-state model. Our findings shows the apparent inability for the users in the internet accesses as a result of EU regulations on the generative-AI.</description>

      <title>Gentrification, Mobility, and Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of localized housing price hikes on renters' mobility, consumption, and credit outcomes. Consistent with a spatial equilibrium model, we find that the consumption responses vary greatly for movers and stayers. While movers increase their consumption, purchase homes, and cars, stayers are relatively unaffected.</description>

      <title>Credit and Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a tight connection between credit access and voting. We show that uncertainty in access to credit pushes voters toward more conservative candidates in US elections. Using a 1% sample of the US population with valid credit reports, we relate access to credit to voting outcomes in all county-by-congressional districts over the period 2004-2016. Specifically, we construct exogenous measures of uncertainty to credit access, i.e. credit score values around which individual total credit amount jumps the most (e.g. around which uncertainty on access to credit is the highest). We then show that a 10pp increase in the share of marginal voters located just around these thresholds increases republican votes by 2.7pp, and reduces that of democrats by 2.6pp. Furthermore, winning candidates in more uncertain constituencies tend to follow a more conservative rhetoric.</description>

      <title>Robust Routing and Scheduling of Home Healthcare Workers: A Nested Branch-and-Price Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global home healthcare market is growing rapidly due to aging populations, advancements in healthcare technology, and patient preference for home-based care. In this paper, we study the multi-day planning problem of simultaneously deciding patient acceptance, assignment, routing, and scheduling under uncertain travel and service times. Our approach ensures cardinality-constrained robustness with respect to timely patient care and the prevention of overtime. We take into account a wide range of criteria including patient time windows, caregiver availability and compatibility, a minimum time interval between two visits of a patient, the total number of required visits, continuity of care, and profit. We use a novel systematic modeling scheme that prioritizes health-related criteria as hard constraints and optimizes cost and preference-related criteria as part of the objective function. We present a mixed-integer linear program formulation, along with a nested branch-and-price technique. Results from a case study in Austin, Texas demonstrate that instances of realistic size can be solved to optimality within reasonable runtimes. The price of robustness primarily results from reduced patient load per caregiver. Interestingly, the criterion of geographical proximity appears to be of secondary priority when selecting new patients and assigning them to caregivers.</description>

      <title>Non-Linearities in International Spillovers of the ECB$^\prime$s Monetary Policy. The Case of Non-ERM II Countries and Anti-Fragmentation Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of sign and size non-linearities in the impact of the European Central Bank$^\prime$s Anti-Fragmentation Policy on non-ERM II, EU countries. After identifying three orthogonal monetary policy shock using the method of Fanelli and Marsi [2022], we then select an optimal specification and estimate both linear and non linear impulse response functions using local projections (Dufour and Renault [1998], Goncalves et al. [2021]). The choice of non-linear transformations to separate sign and size effects is based on Caravello and Martinez-Bruera [Working Paper, 2024]. Lastly we compare the linear model to the non-linear ones using a battery of Wald tests and find significant evidence of sign non-linearities in the international spillovers of ECB policy.</description>
