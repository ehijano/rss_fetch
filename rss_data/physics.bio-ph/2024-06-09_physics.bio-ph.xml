      <title>Metasurfaces for infrared multi-modal microscopy: phase contrast and bright field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different imaging modalities are used to extract the diverse information carried in an optical field. Two prominent modalities include bright field and phase contrast microscopy that can visualize the amplitude and phase features of a sample, respectively. However, capturing both of these images on the same camera typically requires interchanging optical components. Metasurfaces are ultra-thin nanostructures that can merge both of these operations into a single miniaturized device. Here, a silicon-based metasurface that supports a Mie resonance is demonstrated to perform near-infrared phase contrast and bright field multi-modal microscopy that can be tuned by changing the polarization of the illumination. We performed experiments using optical fields with phase variations synthesized by a spatial light modulator and introduced by propagation through semi-transparent samples, including C. elegans, unstained human prostate cancer cells and breast tissue. The results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces for label-free point-of-care testing.</description>

      <title>A generic coupling between internal states and activity leads to activation fronts and criticality in active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the onset of collective motion, we investigate active systems where particles switch on and off their self-propulsion. We prove that even when the only possible transition is off$\to$on, an active 2-state system behaves as an effective 3-state system that exhibits a sharp phase transition in 1D, and critical behavior in 2D, with scale-invariant activity avalanches. The obtained results show how criticality can naturally emerge in active systems, providing insight into the way collectives distribute, process, and respond to local environmental cues.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Impact of Organic Molecules and Phosphate Ions on Biosilica Pattern Formation in Diatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid and complex patterning of biosilica in diatom frustules is of great interest in nanotechnology, although it remains incompletely understood. Specific organic molecules, including long-chain polyamines, silaffins, and silacidins are essential in this process. The molecular structure of the synthesized polyamines significantly affects the quantity, size, and shape of silica precipitates. Experimental findings show that silica precipitation occurs at specific phosphate ion concentrations. We focus on the hypothesis that pattern formation in diatom valve structures is driven by phase separation of species-specific organic molecules. The resulting organic structures serve as templates for silica precipitation. We investigate the role of phosphate ions in self-assembly of organic molecules and analyze how the reaction between them affects the morphology of the organic template. Using mathematical and computational techniques, we gain an understanding of the range of patterns that can arise in a phase-separating system. By varying the degree of dissociation and the initial concentrations of reacting components we demonstrate that the resulting geometric features are highly dependent on these factors. This approach provides insights into the parameters controlling patterning. Additionally, we consider the effects of prepatterns, mimicking silica ribs that preexist the pores, on the final patterns.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude against the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the drawback of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular activities.</description>
