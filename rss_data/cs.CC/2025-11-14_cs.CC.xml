      <title>Low-soundness direct-product testers and PCPs from Kaufman--Oppenheim complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kaufman--Oppenheim coset complexes (STOC 2018, Eur. J. Comb. 2023), which have an elementary and strongly explicit description. Answering an open question of Kaufman, Oppenheim, and Weinberger (STOC 2025), we show that they support sparse direct-product testers in the low soundness regime. Our proof relies on the HDX characterization of agreement testing by Bafna--Minzer and Dikstein--Dinur (both STOC 2024), the recent result of Kaufman. et al, and follows techniques from Bafna--Lifshitz--Minzer and Dikstein--Dinur--Lubotzky (both FOCS 2024). Ultimately, the task reduces to showing dimension-independent coboundary expansion of certain $2$-dimensional subcomplexes of the KO complex; following the ``Dehn method'' of Kaufman and Oppenheim (ICALP 2021), we do this by establishing efficient presentation bounds for certain matrix groups over polynomial rings.
  As shown by Bafna, Minzer, and Vyas (STOC 2025), a consequence of our direct-product testing result is that the Kaufman--Oppenheim complexes can also be used to obtain PCPs with arbitrarily small constant soundness and quasilinear length. Thus the use of sophisticated number theory and algebraic group-theoretic tools in the construction of these PCPs can be avoided.</description>

      <title>A measurement-driven quantum algorithm for SAT: Performance guarantees via spectral gaps and measurement parallelization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is of central importance in both theory and practice. Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Is nasty noise actually harder than malicious noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $\eta$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $\eta$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $\eta_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $\eta_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $\eta$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $\eta/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.</description>

      <title>Positive Univariate Polynomials: SOS certificates, algorithms, bit complexity, and T-systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study certificates of positivity for univariate polynomials with rational coefficients that are positive over (an interval of)~$\mathbb{R}$, given as weighted sums of squares (SOS) of rational polynomials. We build on the algorithm of Chevillard, Harrison, Joldes, and Lauter~\cite{chml-usos-alg-11}, which we call \usos. For a polynomial of degree~$d$ and coefficient bitsize~$\tau$, we show that a rational weighted SOS representation can be computed in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_B(d^3 + d^2 \tau)$ bit operations, and the certificate has bitsize $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2 \tau)$. This improves the best-known bounds by a factor~$d$ and completes previous analyses. We also extend the method to positivity over arbitrary rational intervals, again saving a factor~$d$. For univariate rational polynomials we further introduce \emph{perturbed SOS certificates}. These consist of a sum of two rational squares approximating the input polynomial so that nonnegativity of the approximation implies that of the original. Their computation has the same bit complexity and certificate size as in the weighted SOS case. We also investigate structural properties of these SOS decompositions. Using the classical fact that any nonnegative univariate real polynomial is a sum of two real squares, we prove that the summands form an interlacing pair. Their real roots correspond to the Karlin points of the original polynomial, linking our construction to the T-systems of Karlin~\cite{Karlin-repr-pos-63}. This enables explicit computation of such decompositions, whereas only existential results were previously known. We obtain analogous results for positivity over $(0,\infty)$ and thus over arbitrary real intervals. Finally, we present an open-source Maple implementation of \usos and report experiments on diverse inputs that demonstrate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Datalog-Expressibility for Monadic and Guarded Second-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the sentences in Monadic Second-order Logic (MSO) that are over finite structures equivalent to a Datalog program, in terms of an existential pebble game. We also show that for every class C of finite structures that can be expressed in MSO and is closed under homomorphisms, and for all integers l,k, there exists a canonical Datalog program Pi of width (l,k) in the sense of Feder and Verdi. The same characterisations also hold for Guarded Second-order Logic (GSO), which properly extends MSO. To prove our results, we show that every class C in GSO whose complement is closed under homomorphisms is a finite union of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) of countably categorical structures. The intersection of MSO and Datalog is known to contain the class of nested monadically defined queries (Nemodeq); likewise, we show that the intersection of GSO and Datalog contains all problems that can be expressed by the more expressive language of nested guarded queries. Yet, by exploiting our results, we can show that neither of the two query languages can serve as a characterization, as we exhibit a query in the intersection of MSO and Datalog that is not expressible in nested guarded queries.</description>

      <title>Unique Hard Attention: A Tale of Two Sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the expressive power of transformers has recently attracted attention, as it offers insights into their abilities and limitations. Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention -- in that case, they correspond to a \emph{strictly weaker} fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to \emph{soft} attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity and underscore the role of attention directionality.</description>
