      <title>Lagrangian for Navier-Stokes equations of motion: SDPD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditions necessary and sufficient for the Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (SDPD) equations of motion to have a Lagrangian that can be used for deriving these equations of motion, the Helmholtz conditions, are obtained and analysed. They show that for a finite number of SDPD particles the conditions are not satisfied; hence, the SDPD equations of motion can not be obtained using the classical Euler-Lagrange equation approach. However, when the macroscopic limit is considered, that is when the number of particles tends to infinity, the conditions are satisfied, thus providing the conceptual possibility of obtaining the Navier-Stokes equations from the principle of least action.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Flow in Microtubule Tryptophan Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of aromatic amino acid residues within microtubules, particularly those formed by tryptophan, may serve as pathways for optical information flow. Ultraviolet excitation dynamics in these networks are typically modeled with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. By extending this approach to a Lindblad master equation that incorporates explicit site geometries and dipole orientations, we track how correlations are generated, routed, and dissipated, while capturing both energy dissipation and information propagation among coupled chromophores. We compare localized injections, fully delocalized preparations, and eigenmode-based initial states. To quantify the emerging quantum-informational structure, we evaluate the $L_1$ norm of coherence, the correlated coherence, and the logarithmic negativity within and between selected chromophore sub-networks. The results reveal a strong dependence of both the direction and persistence of information flow on the type of initial preparation. Superradiant components drive the rapid export of correlations to the environment, whereas subradiant components retain them and slow their leakage. Embedding single tubulin units into larger dimers and spirals reshapes pairwise correlation maps and enables site-selective routing. Scaling to larger ordered lattices strengthens both export and retention channels, whereas static energetic and structural disorder suppresses long-range transport and reduces overall correlation transfer. These findings provide a Lindbladian picture of information flow in cytoskeletal chromophore networks and identify structural and dynamical conditions that transiently preserve nonclassical correlations in microtubules.</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, unbalanced probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Based Heterogeneity Inference Reveals Non-Stationary Effects in Biohybrid Cell-Cargo Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is a ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and multistability in inducible three-gene toggle switch networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control of transcription presides over a vast array of biological processes, including those mediated by gene regulatory circuits that exhibit multistability. Within these circuits, two- and three-gene network motifs are particularly critical to the repertoire of metabolic and developmental pathways. Theoretical models of these circuits, however, often vary parameters such as dissociation constants, transcription rates, and degradation rates without specifying precisely how these parameters are controlled biologically. In this study, we examine the role of effector molecules, which can alter the concentrations of the active transcription factors that control regulation, and are ubiquitous in regulatory processes across many biological settings. We specifically consider allosteric regulation in the context of extending the standard bistable switch to three-gene networks, and explore the rich multistable dynamics exhibited in these architectures as a function of effector concentrations. We then analyze how the dynamics evolve under various interpretations of regulatory circuit mechanics, underlying inducer activity, and perturbations thereof. Notably, the biological mechanism by which we model effector control over dual-function proteins transforms not only the phenotypic trend of dynamic tuning but also the set of available dynamic regimes. In this way, we determine key parameters and regulatory features that drive phenotypic decisions, and offer an experimentally tunable structure for encoding inducible multistable behavior arising from both single and dual-function allosteric transcription factors.</description>
