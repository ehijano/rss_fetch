      <title>Comment on "Quantum coherence between mass eigenstates of a neutrino cannot be destroyed by its mass-momentum entanglement"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2410.21850, I proved that the quantum coherence between the mass eigenstates of a neutrino will be destroyed if they are correlated with different momenta. In arXiv:2411.01190, James M. Cline claimed that I had made the unrealistic assumption that the neutrino is always in a nearly exact energy eigenstate, and ignored the spatial dependence of the wavefunction in my paper. However, I did not assume that the neutrino is in a nearly exact eigenstate of energy anywhere in my paper, and the wavefunction I wrote in the position representation has a spatial dependence. The argumentation of arXiv:2411.01190 is based on misinterpreting my claim, and on ignoring the critical fact that the neutrino's wavepacket has a finite size and the detector has a large volume.</description>

      <title>Search for $K_{S,L}$ oscillations and invisible decays into the dark sector at NA64</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decays $K_{S,L}$ have never been experimentally tested. In the Standard Model their branching ratios for the decay into two neutrinos are predicted to be extremely small, $Br(K_{S,L} \to \nu \bar{\nu}) \lesssim 10^{-16}$. We consider several natural extensions of the SM, such as two-Higgs-doublet (2HDM), 2HDM and light scalar, and dark mirror sector models, that allow to enhance the $Br(K_{S,L})$ up to a measurable level. We briefly discuss the possible search for $K_{S,L}$ decays and $K_{S,L}$ oscillations into the dark sector at the NA64 experiment at CERN with the sensitivity to $Br(K_{S,L}) \lesssim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Systematic Spurion Matching between Low Energy EFT and Chiral Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic chiral Lagrangian can be matched from the low energy effective field theory (LEFT) operators at the quark level. Traditionally, as the mass dimension of the LEFT operators increases, more and more external sources are necessarily introduced in the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In this work, we present a systematic matching procedure with the single spurion field $\mathbf{T}$ of the flavor $SU(3)_V$ octet, without the need of external sources. We present the complete sets of the LEFT operators, which have been reformulated using the flavor $SU(3)_V$ symmetry up to dimension 9. At the same time, the ChPT Lagrangian is also reformulated using the single spurion and lepton fields, instead of external sources. The spurion matching can be performed between LEFT and ChPT operators with the same flavor $SU(3)_V$ and $CP$ structures, and the same leptonic currents, using the naive dimensional analysis at the quark and hadronic levels.</description>

      <title>Optical gravitational waves as signals of Gravitationally-Decaying Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived heavy particles present during the big bang could have a decay channel opened by gravitons. Such decays can produce gravitational waves with large enough abundance to be detectable, and a peculiar narrow spectrum peaked today around optical frequencies. We identify which particles can decay in one or two gravitons. The maximal gravitational wave abundance arises from theories with extra hidden strong gauge dynamics, such as a confining pure-glue group. An interesting abundance also arises in theories with perturbative couplings. Future observation might shed light on early cosmology and allow some spectroscopy of sub-Planckian gravitationally-decaying particles, plausibly present in a variety of theories such as gauge unification, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, strings.</description>

      <title>Drell-Yan constraints on charged scalars: a weak isospin perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged scalars appear in many motivated extensions beyond the Standard Model. We analyze the constraints on charged scalar pair production via the Drell-Yan process at the Large Hadron Collider and interpret them in terms of weak isospin quantum numbers. Leveraging the experimental limits from existing LHC data and phenomenological recast analyses, we place bounds on the branching ratio of the charged scalar, as a function of its mass, electric charge, and isospin. This approach enables to determine limits on the branching ratios directly from experimental data, without appealing to a specific model. We provide a detailed analysis for singly and doubly charged scalars across various weak isospin scenarios, focusing on decays into leptonic and bosonic final states, and validate this approach in extended Higgs sectors such as the Higgs triplet model and Georgi-Machacek model.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse phenomenological signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles, described by an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor, when coupled to fermionic matter. The latter is modelled by a tensor current coupled directly to the Kalb-Ramond field or by a pseudovector current coupled to the rank-1 dual of the field-strength tensor. We obtain limits on the coupling constants to fermions and mass of the Kalb-Ramond-like particles by investigating their impact on the spectroscopy of simple atomic systems, the tree-level unitarity of the $S$ matrix for $e^- + e^+ \rightarrow \ell^- + \ell^+$ scattering with $\ell \neq e$ and the differential cross section for Bhabha scattering. Assuming that the couplings to fermions are independent of the fermion species, the strongest $95\%$-CL bounds we find are from LEP data at $\sqrt{s} = 136.23$~GeV, namely $g_{\rm PV}/\Lambda \lesssim 6.3 \times 10^{-13} \, {\rm eV}^{-1}$ and $g_{\rm T} \lesssim 1.3 \times 10^{-12} \left( m/{\rm eV} \right)$, both for $m \ll \sqrt{s}$ (here $\Lambda$ is a characteristic energy scale). These limits can be improved in upcoming lepton colliders due to enhanced precision, as well as higher energies.</description>

      <title>Dirt/Detector/Dump: Complementary BSM production at Short-Baseline Neutrino Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-baseline neutrino (SBN) facilities are optimal for new-physics searches, including the possible production of new particles in and along the neutrino beamline. One such class of models considers states that are created by neutrino upscattering that then decay in the neutrino detector -- in the past, such upscattering has often been considered to occur in the detector itself (with a prompt decay) or in the dirt upstream of the detector. In this work, we highlight the importance of the beam dumps, situated even further upstream, for such searches. The Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, with its iron dump, provides one such possibility. We focus on sub-GeV heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) with a transition magnetic moment, which allows this upscattering to take advantage of the high-$Z$ iron. We observe that, in addition to increased sensitivity to this model at SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS, there exist distinct features in the signal events' kinematical properties when coming from production in the dump, dirt, and detector which can allow for enhanced signal-to-background separation. We highlight the complementarity of this approach to study parameter space relevant for the MiniBooNE low-energy excess, as well as in models in which the HNLs couple to a light scalar particle.</description>

      <title>Kaon-induced production of strange hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}$ from proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the kaon-induced production of strange hidden-charm pentaquark $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}$ states, including the $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4459)$ and $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$ observed by the LHCb collaboration. Coupled-channel interactions involving the channels $\bar{K}N$, $\Xi_c^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$, $\Xi'_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$, $\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s^{(*)}$, and $\Lambda J/\psi$ are studied using effective Lagrangians to describe these interactions. The potential kernels are constructed within the one-boson-exchange model and implemented into the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation to calculate the scattering amplitudes. From these amplitudes, the partial-wave cross sections for kaon-induced production are predicted alongside the poles corresponding to strange hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks. The analysis reveals complex structures in the cross sections due to molecular states. A structure near the $\Xi_c\bar{D}$ threshold is predicted in the $\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s$ channel, corresponding to $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$. Both molecular states near the $\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$ threshold with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $J^P = 3/2^-$, associated with $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4459)$, produce peaks in the $\Xi'_c\bar{D}$ channel, which vary significantly with the cutoff. Additionally, a molecular state with $J^P =3/2^-$ near the $\Xi_c^*\bar{D}$ threshold gives rise to a peak in the $\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$ channel. In the higher energy region, from 4350 to 4550 MeV, although the cross sections in the $\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s^{(*)}$ channels are substantial, no distinct structures corresponding to strange hidden-charm pentaquarks are identified, apart from some threshold-related cusps. These results provide valuable theoretical insights and serve as a foundation for future experimental studies of strange hidden-charm pentaquarks using kaon beams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar neutrinos, generated abundantly by thermonuclear reactions in the solar interior, offer a unique tool for studying astrophysics and particle physics. The observation of solar neutrinos has led to the discovery of neutrino oscillation, a topic currently under active research, and it has been recognized by two Nobel Prizes. In this pedagogical introduction to solar neutrino physics, we will guide readers through several key questions: How are solar neutrinos produced? How are they detected? What is the solar neutrino problem, and how is it resolved by neutrino oscillation? This article also presents a brief overview of the theory of solar neutrino oscillation, the experimental achievements, new physics relevant to solar neutrinos, and the prospects in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a pedagogical exploration of coupled-channel scattering in hadronic physics, focusing on theoretical methodologies, and practical applications. It covers key concepts such as the $N/D$ method, Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson poles, and the generalization of these techniques to coupled channels. The article also presents a parameterization for partial wave amplitudes, ensuring unitarity and analyticity, and addresses scattering near the threshold of dominant channels, with use also of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Additionally, it explores final-state interactions, Omn\`es and Muskhelishvily solutions, the Khuri-Treiman approach, and the two-potential model for resonant event distributions, highlighting the role of Riemann sheets in resonance behavior. These methods are also applicable to related fields like nuclear and atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Gluon skewed generalized parton distributions of proton from a light-front Hamiltonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate all leading-twist gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) inside the proton at nonzero skewness using the basis light-front quantization framework. The proton's light-front wave functions are derived from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian incorporating Quantum Chromodynamics inputs. Our results show that the qualitative behaviors of the GPDs are consistent with those from other theoretical calculations. Additionally, we analyze the GPDs in the boost-invariant longitudinal coordinate, $\sigma=\frac{1}{2} b^- P^+$, which serves as the Fourier conjugate of the skewness. The GPDs in $\sigma$-space exhibit diffraction patterns, reminiscent of optical wave diffraction.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis in the presence of density perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out a new effect on the freeze-out process of heavy particles induced by density perturbations in the early universe, which we call ``acoustically driven freeze-out.'' This beyond-linear effect is caused by the exponential decoupling of heavy particles from the thermal bath in the presence of density perturbations, and already at moderately large values $\delta T / \bar{T} = O (10^{-2})$ it cannot be captured by linear perturbation theory. We illustrate this effect with leptogenesis taking the decay and inverse decay of heavy neutrinos into account, and discuss its phenomenological implications. We found that perturbations always enhance the (spatially averaged) values of the final lepton asymmetry, and as a result, constraints on the mass of heavy neutrinos are found to be relaxed in the presence of perturbations.</description>

      <title>Scalar fully-charm and bottom tetraquarks under extreme temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature dependences of masses and current couplings of the ground state of the fully heavy tetraquarks $T_{4c}$ and $T_{4b}$, composed of charm $(c)$ and bottom $(b)$ quarks and antiquarks with spin-parities $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ are evaluated in the diquark antidiquark picture using Thermal QCD Sum Rules including vacuum condensates up to dimension four. The calculated values for $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$ and $bb\bar{b}\bar{b}$ tetraquark states at $T=0$ align well with the experimental data on the broad structures. Based on the numerical analyses around the critical temperature, the mass of the $T_{4c}$ state decreases by $8\%$ compared to its vacuum state, while for its b partner, this percentage is approximately $3.3\%$. For the decay constants, the reductions are approximately $71\%$ and $66.6\%$, respectively. The precise exploration of tetraquark states awaits future scrutiny in upcoming experiments, including Belle II, Super-B, PANDA, and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Binary superfluids: low-energy properties and dissipative processes from spontaneous emission of massive phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</description>

      <title>Pauli principle forbids $\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}$ bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice QCD studies have shown the attractive character of the $^1S_0$ $\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}$, $Q=s,c,b$, interaction, predicting deeply bound states as the mass of the heavy quark increases. This has led to the question of the possible existence of bound states of more than two $\Omega_{QQQ}$ baryons, in particular $\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}$ bound states. We discuss how these states might not exist in nature in any flavor sector. The reason would be due to the simultaneous action of two consequences of the Pauli principle in the different partial waves: one at the baryon level, affecting the $^1S_0$ partial wave, and the other due to the quark substructure, affecting the $^5S_2$ partial wave.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possible existence of bound states of three $\Omega_{bbb}$ baryons. We consider only $S$ wave interactions and we start from recent lattice QCD results which give a strongly attractive potential between two $\Omega_{bbb}$ baryons in the $^1S_0$ channel. We analyze different scenarios. At baryonic level, the $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ interaction could be understood to be basically spin-independent, so that the two contributing channels, $^1S_0$ and $^5S_2$, would have a very similar interaction. This baryonic analysis leads to the existence of bound states in the three-body system. At the quark level, repulsive effects would appear in the $^5S_2$ channel, making it more repulsive than the $^1S_0$ channel. We study the effect of such repulsion in terms of its range.</description>

      <title>Soft gluon resummation for gluon fusion $ZH$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effects of soft gluons on Higgs boson production in association with a $Z$ boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Utilizing the universal cusp anomalous dimensions and splitting kernels, we analyze effects of soft gluons on the gluon fusion $ZH$ process, focusing on the total production cross-section as well as the invariant mass distribution at the next-to-leading logarithmic level. Additionally, we estimate the next-to-soft effects on this subprocess to the same level of accuracy. A detailed phenomenological analysis is performed for the $13.6$ TeV LHC. Finally, combining these results with those from other subprocesses, we provide comprehensive predictions for the $ZH$ production cross-section and the invariant mass distribution that will be valuable for comparison with experimental data from the upcoming LHC run as well as the future hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Standard Model and Beyond from the Evidence of CE$\nu$NS with Reactor Antineutrinos in CONUS+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of the Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) process using reactor antineutrinos offers a unique opportunity to probe the Standard Model and explore Beyond the Standard Model scenarios. This study reports on the latest results from the CONUS+ experiment conducted at the Leibstadt nuclear power plant (KKL), Switzerland. The CONUS collaboration reports $395 \pm 106$ events detected from reactor antineutrinos with an exposure of 347 kg$\cdot$days, utilizing high-purity germanium detectors operated at sub-keV thresholds. A $\chi^2$-based statistical analysis was performed on these results, incorporating systematic uncertainties. This analysis was used to extract the weak mixing angle, establish a limit on the neutrino magnetic moment, and impose constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions using reactor antineutrinos. The results confirm the potential of CE$\nu$NS experiments in the study of fundamental neutrino properties and probing new physics.</description>

      <title>Parton distributions confront LHC Run II data: a quantitative appraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of theoretical predictions and various high-precision experimental measurements, specifically of differential cross sections performed by the LHC run II for Drell-Yan gauge boson, top-quark pair, single-inclusive jet and di-jet production, and by HERA for single-inclusive jet and di-jet production. Theoretical predictions are computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. The most widely employed sets of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) are used, and PDF, strong coupling, and missing higher order uncertainties are taken into account. We quantitatively assess the predictive power of each PDF set and the contribution of the different sources of experimental and theoretical uncertainty to the agreement between data and predictions. We show that control over all of these aspects is crucial to precision physics studies, such as the determination of Standard Model parameters at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in extreme mass ratio inspirals: perturbations to the environment in Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observatories open a unique avenue to study the environments surrounding black holes. Intermediate or extreme mass ratio inspirals will spend thousands to millions of cycles in the sensitivity range of detectors, allowing subtle environmental effects to accumulate in the gravitational waveform. Working in Lorenz gauge and considering equatorial circular orbits, we present the first self-consistent, fully relativistic calculation of a perturbation to a black hole environment due to an inspiraling secondary in the Kerr geometry. As an example case, we consider the environment to be that of a superradiantly grown scalar cloud, though our framework is generalizable to other scenarios. We demonstrate that the scalar field develops a rich wake structure induced by the secondary and compute scalar fluxes emitted to infinity and through the horizon. Relative differences in the fluxes compared to Schwarzschild are tens of percent on large intervals of parameter space, underscoring the importance of modeling in Kerr.</description>

      <title>More varieties of 4-d gauge theories: product representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we used methods of arithmetic geometry to study the anomaly-free irreducible representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra. Here we generalize to the case of products of irreducible representations, where it is again possible to give a complete description. A key result is that the projective variety corresponding to $m$-fold product representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_n$ is a rational variety for every $m$ and $n$. We study the simplest case of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ (corresponding to the strong interaction) in detail. We also describe the implications of a number-theoretic conjecture of Manin (and related theorems) for the number of chiral representations of bounded size $B$ (measured roughly by the Dynkin labels) compared to non-chiral ones, giving a precise meaning to the sense in which the former, which are those most relevant for phenomenology, are rare compared to the latter. As examples, we show that, for both irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}_5$ and once-reducible product representations of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ that are non-anomalous, the number of chiral representations is asymptotically between $B (\log B)^5$ and $B^\frac{4}{3}$, while the number of non-chiral representations is asymptotically $B^2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a manifold of a system with internal degrees of freedom, such as Lorentz symmetry or gauge symmetry, the ``curvature'' is defined for the manifold. If one defines the local vacuum in the tangent space of the manifold, one can define a local mapping in the vicinity of the contact point, which is nothing but the Bogoliubov transformation. The curvature of the electromagnetic field gives the Schwinger effect, and the curvature of the base space introduces the local Unruh effect, which realizes Hawking radiation if applied on the Black hole horizon. To show how the Bogoliubov transformation appears on the manifold and why the local calculation is crucial there, we consider the Schwinger effect with a slowly varying electric field. Then, we show what happens in the Unruh effect if the acceleration is not a constant parameter.</description>

      <title>Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field, which admits viable solutions of bouncing universe satisfying the following requirements: (i) absence of Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) instability, ghost and gradient instability, (ii) absence of superluminality, (iii) generation of nearly scale-invariant curvature perturbations and very small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and (iv) conventional asymptotics in the distant past and future, where gravity sector is described by General Relativity and the DHOST scalar has a canonical form of Lagrangian. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Nuclear equation of state at finite $\mu_B$ using deep learning assisted quasi-parton model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To accurately determine the nuclear equation of state (EoS) at finite baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) remains a challenging yet essential goal in the study of QCD matter under extreme conditions. In this study, we develop a deep learning assisted quasi-parton model, which utilizes three deep neural networks, to reconstruct the QCD EoS at zero $\mu_B$ and predict the EoS and transport coefficient $\eta/s$ at finite $\mu_B$. The EoS derived from our quasi-parton model shows excellent agreement with lattice QCD results obtained using Taylor expansion techniques. The minimum value of $\eta/s$ is found to be approximately 175 MeV and decreases with increasing chemical potential within the confidence interval. This model not only provides a robust framework for understanding the properties of the QCD EoS at finite $\mu_B$ but also offers critical input for relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of nuclear matter produced in heavy-ion collisions by the RHIC beam energy scan program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produce an intense, high-energy beam of neutrinos of all flavors, collimated in the forward direction. Recently two dedicated neutrino experiments, FASER and SND@LHC, have started operating to take advantage of the TeV energy LHC neutrino beam, with first results released in 2023 and further results released in 2024. The first detection of neutrinos produced at a particle collider opens up a new avenue of research, allowing to study the highest energy neutrinos produced in a controlled laboratory environment, with an associated broad and rich physics program. Neutrino measurements at the LHC will provide important contributions to QCD, neutrino and BSM physics, with impactful implications for astro-particle physics. This review article summarizes the physics motivation, status and plans of, present and future neutrino experiments at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework allowing to make an explicit connection between the phenomenology of QCD, namely the properties of the gluon correlator and Wilson loops, and a particular relativistic model for the description of nuclear matter and neutron stars, the chiral confining model. Starting with the Field Correlator Method, which incorporates explicitly and simultaneously confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, we describe how to obtain the response of the composite nucleon to the nuclear scalar field, the relative role of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in the in-medium nucleon mass evolution, generating the three-body forces needed for the saturation mechanism.</description>

      <title>DeepSSM: an emulator of gravitational wave spectra from sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DeepSSM, an open-source code powered by neural networks (NNs) to emulate gravitational wave (GW) spectra produced by sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions in the radiation-dominated era. The training data is obtained from an enhanced version of the Sound Shell Model (SSM), which accounts for the effects of cosmic expansion and yields more accurate spectra in the infrared regime. The emulator enables instantaneous predictions of GW spectra given the phase transition parameters, while achieving agreement with the enhanced SSM model within 10\% accuracy in the worst-case scenarios. The emulator is highly computationally efficient and fully differentiable, making it particularly suitable for direct Bayesian inference on phase transition parameters without relying on empirical templates, such as broken power-law models. We demonstrate this capability by successfully reconstructing phase transition parameters and their degeneracies from mock LISA observations using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. The code is available at: https://github.com/ctian282/DeepSSM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the momentum-space Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for structure functions measurable in deeply inelastic scattering. We construct a six-dimensional basis of structure functions that allows for a full three flavor structure and thereby provides a way to calculate perturbative predictions for physical cross sections directly without unobservable parton distribution functions (PDFs) and without the associated scheme dependence. We derive the DGLAP equations to first non-zero order in strong coupling $\alpha_s$, but the approach can be pursued to arbitrary order in perturbation theory. We also numerically check our equations against the conventional PDF formulation.</description>

      <title>A potential approach to the $X(3872)$ thermal behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the potential of $X(3872)$ at finite temperature in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation under the assumption that it is a tetraquark. We argue that, at large number of colors, it is a good approximation to assume that the potential consists in a real part plus a constant imaginary term. The real part is then computed adapting an approach by Rothkopf and Lafferty and using as input lattice QCD determinations of the potential for hybrids. This model allows us to qualitatively estimate at which temperature range the formation of a heavy tetraquark is possible, and to propose a qualitative picture for the dissociation of the state in a medium. Our approach can be applied to other suggested internal structures for the $X(3872)$ and to other exotic states.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Dirac from Majorana Heavy Neutrino at Future Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to identify whether a sterile neutrino is Dirac-type or Majorana-type by counting the peak of the rapidity distribution at lepton colliders. Our method requires only one charged-lepton tagging, and the nature of sterile neutrinos can be pinned down once they are confirmed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that a measurement of the Higgs boson self-coupling becomes particularly meaningful in a large and important class of theories when its sensitivity is within 40\% of its Standard Model value. This constitutes a target for a future impactful experimental achievement. It is derived from recently obtained results of how extreme the differences can be between effective field theory operator coefficients when their origins are from reasonable custodial-violating theories beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Holographic Schwinger effect in flavor-dependent systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14828v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic Schwinger effect is investigated in systems with $N_{f}=0$, $N_{f}=2$, and $N_{f}=2+1$ using the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) model, incorporating equation of state and baryon number susceptibility information from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is found that the critical electric field is smallest for $N_{f}=0$, indicating that the Schwinger effect is more likely to occur than in systems with $N_{f}=2$ and $N_{f}=2+1$. The critical electric field decreases with increasing chemical potential and temperature across all systems. Additionally, potential analysis confirms that the maximum total potential energy increases with the number of flavors, suggesting that existing particles may reduce the probability of particle pair production.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnetization and effective interactions in QGP at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quark-gluon plasma (QGP), at higher deconfinement temperatures $T \ge T_d$ the spontaneous generation of color magnetic fields, $b^3(T), b^8(T) \not = 0$ (3, 8 are color indexes), and usual magnetic field $b(T) \not = 0$ happens. Simultaneously, the Polyakov loop and/or algebraically related to it $A_0(T)$ condensate, which is solution to Yang-Mills imaginary time equations, are also created. Usually, in analytic quantum field theory these effects are investigated independently of each other within the effective potentials having different mathematical structures. The common generation of these condensates was detected in lattice Monte Carlo simulations.
  Recently, with the new type two-loop effective potential, which generalizes the known integral representation for the Bernoulli polynomials and takes into consideration the magnetic background, this effect has been derived analytically.
  The corresponding effective potential W(T, b^3, A_0 ) was investigated either in SU(2) gluodynamics or full QCD. The gauge fixing independence of it was proved within the Nielsen identity approach. The values of magnetic field strengths at different temperatures were calculated and the mechanism of stabilizing fields due to A_0(T) condensate has been discovered. In the present review, we describe this important phenomenon in more details, as well as a number of specific effects - induced color charges, effective photon-photon-gluon vertexes - happening due to vacuum polarization at this background. They could serve as the signals of the QGP creation in the heavy ion collision experiments.
  Key words: spontaneous magnetization, high temperature, asymptotic freedom, effective potential, A_0 condensate, effective charge, effective vertexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resum threshold double logarithms that appear in inclusive production of heavy quarkonium. This resolves the catastrophic failure of fixed-order perturbation theory where quarkonium cross sections at large transverse momentum can turn negative due to large radiative corrections. We find that resummation is imperative for describing measured prompt production rates of $J/\psi$ at large transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Gravitino Thermal Production, Dark Matter, and Reheating of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a full one-loop calculation of the gravitino thermal production rate, beyond the so-called hard thermal loop approximation, using the corresponding thermal spectral functions in numerical form on both sides of the light cone. This framework requires a full numerical evaluation. We interpret our results within the framework of a general supergravity-based model, remaining agnostic about the specifics of supersymmetry breaking. In this context, assuming that gravitinos constitute the entirety of the dark matter in the Universe imposes strict constraints on the reheating temperature. For example, with a gluino mass at the current LHC limit, a maximum reheating temperature of $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^9$ GeV is compatible with a gravitino mass of $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV. Additionally, with a reheating temperature an order of magnitude lower at $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^8$ GeV, the common gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$ can range from $2$ to $4 $ TeV within the same gravitino mass range. For much higher values of $M_{1/2}$, which are favored by current accelerator and cosmological data in the context of supersymmetric models, such as $M_{1/2} = 10$ TeV, and for $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV the reheating temperature compatible with the gravitino dark matter scenario is $ 10^7$ GeV. If other dark matter particles are considered, the reheating temperature could be much lower.</description>

      <title>Polarized and un-polarized $\mathcal{R}_{K^*}$ in and beyond the SM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) is lepton flavor universal, and the recent measurements of lepton flavor universality in $B \to (K,K^*)\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, for $\ell = \mu, \; e$, decays now lie close to the SM predictions. However, this is not the case for the $\tau$ to $\mu$ ratios in these decays, where there is still some window open for the new physics (NP), and to accommodate them various extensions to the SM are proposed. It will be interesting to identify some observables which are not only sensitive on the parametric space of such NP models but also have some discriminatory power. We find that the polarization of the $K^{*}$ may play an important role, therefore, we have computed the unpolarized and polarized lepton flavor universality ratios of $\tau$ to $\mu$ in $B\to K^{*}\ell^{+}\ell^{+}$, $\ell= \mu, \tau$ decays. The calculation shows that in most of the cases, the values of the various proposed observables fall within the current experimental sensitivity, and their study at some on going and future experiments will serve as a tool to segregate the variants of the NP models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both freeze-in of very weakly coupled dark matter and freeze-out of initially thermalized dark matter from the primordial heat bath provide interesting possibilities for dark matter creation in the early universe. Both scenarios allow for a calculation of baryon-dark matter coupling constants as a function of dark matter mass due to the constraint that freeze-in or freeze-out produce the observed dark matter abundance. Here we compare the resulting coupling constants in the two scenarios if dark matter couples to baryons through an antisymmetric tensor portal. The freeze-in scenario predicts much smaller coupling in agreement with the nonthermalization postulate. We find that the couplings as a function of mass behave very differently in the two scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the production of hypothetical vector particles, dark photons $\gamma^\prime$, with masses in the range 0.4--1.8 GeV via inelastic proton bremsstrahlung. We further develop the approach of arXiv:2409.11089 and refs. [2-3], where for the first time we considered the contributions to the cross section that are associated with the Pauli form factor in $pp\gamma^\prime$ vertex and obtained new splitting functions. We demonstrate numerically the importance of these corrections to full inelastic proton bremsstrahlung cross section and refine the sensitivity of the ongoing and future fixed-target experiments T2K, DUNE and SHiP to the parameters of dark photon model. A dedicated experiment on measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region below the proton-antiproton threshold, like those suggested in PANDA at FAIR, would help to obtain the robust predictions for the dark photon production by a proton beam at fixed target.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the top quark by the ATLAS and CMS experiments go beyond testing the Standard Model (SM) with high precision. Axion-like particles (ALPs), a potential SM extension involving new pseudoscalar particles, exhibit strong interactions with heavy SM fermions. Consequently, they can significantly affect the kinematic distributions of top quarks in top-antitop pair production. Moreover, such strong interactions can induce other ALP couplings at low energies, leading to a rich phenomenology. We summarize recent developments in probing the ALP-top coupling and use LHC data from run 2 to constrain the ALP parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use chiral perturbation theory to study the long distance regime of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs). Chiral corrections to the TMD PDFs are computed from proton to pion/baryon splittings. For consistent power counting, we find that the fraction of the proton's momentum that a pion may carry must be kept small. We make predictions for a $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry in the proton's TMD PDFs and find that the effective theory gives a natural exponential suppression of the TMD PDF at long distances. We then explore the effects that additional nonperturbative physics may have on the TMD $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the full system of canonical differential equations for all planar two-loop massless six-particle master integrals, and determine analytically the boundary conditions. This fully specifies the solutions, which may be written as Chen iterated integrals. We argue that this is sufficient information for evaluating any scattering amplitude in four dimensions up to the finite part. We support this claim by reducing, for the most complicated integral topologies, integrals with typical Yang-Mills numerators. We use the analytic solutions to the differential equations, together with dihedral symmetry, to provide the full solution space relevant for two-loop six-particle computations. This includes the relevant function alphabet, as well as the independent set of iterated integrals up to weight four. We also provide the answer for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals that can be readily evaluated numerically. As a proof of concept, we provide a numerical implementation that evaluates the integrals in part of the Euclidean region, and validate this against numerical evaluation of the Feynman integrals. Our result removes the bottleneck of Feynman integral evaluation, paving the way to future analytic evaluations of six-particle scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of instantons and anti-instantons. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we show that the dispersion relation for the dynamical modes of dislocations ("dislons") in solids is sensitive to the lattice symmetries. In particular, we show that in the IR, the dislon dispersion relation develops a logarithmic dependence on momenta for approximately isotropic lattices whereas for non-isotropic lattices, the linear term dominates. The renormalization group flows for dislocation tension are shown to be distinct for isotropic and anisotropic lattices.</description>

Abstract: Context. Star clusters constitute a significant part of the stellar population in our Galaxy. The feedback processes they exert on the interstellar medium impact multiple physical processes from the chemical to the dynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In addition, young and massive stellar clusters might act as efficient particle accelerators and contribute to the production of cosmic rays. Aims. We aim at evaluating the wind luminosity driven by the young (&lt; 30 Myr) Galactic open stellar clusters observed by the Gaia space mission. This is crucial for determining the energy channeled into accelerated particles. Methods. To do this, we developed a method relying on the number, magnitude, and line-of-sight extinction of the stars observed per cluster. Assuming that the stellar mass function follows a Kroupa mass distribution and accounting for the maximum stellar mass allowed by the age and mass of the parent cluster, we conservatively estimated the mass and wind luminosity of 387 local clusters within the second data release of Gaia. Results. We compared the results of our computation with recent estimates of young cluster masses. With respect to these, our sample is three times more abundant, particularly above a few thousand solar masses. This is of the utmost relevance for predicting the gamma-ray emission resulting from the interaction of accelerated particles. The cluster wind luminosity distribution we obtained extends up to 3x10^38 erg/s. This is a promising feature in terms of potential particle acceleration scenarios.</description>

Since Hawking evaporation is a quasi-thermal process, no GeV emission is predicted to be produced by black holes if they are part, or all, of the cosmological dark matter. However, black holes could be ``spawned'' at late times with masses that correspond to short lifetimes, and as such be significantly hotter and produce particles well in excess of the GeV. Here we investigate if such late-forming black holes could, at once, explain the tantalizing excesses found in the gamma radiation from the Galactic center, in the flux of cosmic-ray antiproton, and in the few tentative antihelium events reported by the anti-matter spectrometer AMS-02. We find that late-forming black holes cannot simultaneously explain all these excesses. We additionally compute accurate predictions for the anti-deuteron, high-energy neutrino, and positron fluxes if this scenario is realized in nature. We find that while the neutrino and positron fluxes are too small compared to the expected background, a significant number of anti-deuteron events is expected both at AMS-02 and at the future General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS).</description>

      <title>Prospects for the detection of Dark Matter with Long-lived Mediators in the Sun using the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The operation of the next generation of gamma-ray observatories will lead to a great advance in dark matter searches. In this paper, we use the hidden sectors hypothesis within the so-called secluded models to calculate the capabilities of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) to detect gamma-ray signatures produced by dark matter particles concentrated in the Sun. We assume the dark matter particle annihilates into metastable mediators which decay into $\gamma\gamma$, $e^+e^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $\bar{b}b$ outside the Sun. We found that the SWGO will be able to probe a spin-dependent cross-section of about $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for dark matter masses smaller than 5 TeV. This result shows an unprecedented sensitivity surpassing the current instruments by more than one order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, $D$-meson, $B$-meson, and nucleon physics with the aim of making them easily accessible to the nuclear and particle physics communities. More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor $f_+(0)$ arising in the semileptonic $K \to \pi$ transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay-constant ratio $f_K/f_\pi$ and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$. We review the determination of the $B_K$ parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four $B$ parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for $m_c$ and $m_b$ as well as those for the decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters of charmed and bottom mesons and baryons. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. We review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. We review the determinations of nucleon charges from the matrix elements of both isovector and flavour-diagonal axial, scalar and tensor local quark bilinears, and momentum fraction, helicity moment and the transversity moment from one-link quark bilinears. We also review determinations of scale-setting quantities. Finally, in this review we have added a new section on the general definition of the low-energy limit of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation from Power Spectrum with Finite-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and accurate method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. By introducing a window function to account for relevant perturbation scales for PBHs of different masses, as well as a filter function circumventing overproduction of small PBHs, we find that previous studies might have dramatically overestimated the abundance of PBHs by up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Solutions in Scalar-Tensor theory via the Eisenhart-Duval lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement the Einsenhart-Duval lift in scalar-tensor gravity as a means to construct integrable cosmological models and analytic cosmological solutions. Specifically, we employ a geometric criterion to constrain the free functions of the scalar-tensor theory such that the field equations can be written in the equivalent form of linear equations. This geometric linearization is achieved by the introduction of an extended minisuperspace description. The results are applied to construct analytic solutions in modified theories of gravity such as the $f\left( R\right) $-theory and the hybrid metric-Palatini $f\left( \mathcal{R}\right) $-gravity.</description>
