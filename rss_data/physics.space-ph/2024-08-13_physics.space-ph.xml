      <title>Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</description>

      <title>EclipseNETs: a differentiable description of irregular eclipse conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of spaceflight mechanics and astrodynamics, determining eclipse regions is a frequent and critical challenge. This determination impacts various factors, including the acceleration induced by solar radiation pressure, the spacecraft power input, and its thermal state all of which must be accounted for in various phases of the mission design. This study leverages recent advances in neural image processing to develop fully differentiable models of eclipse regions for highly irregular celestial bodies. By utilizing test cases involving Solar System bodies previously visited by spacecraft, such as 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, and 101955 Bennu, we propose and study an implicit neural architecture defining the shape of the eclipse cone based on the Sun's direction. Employing periodic activation functions, we achieve high precision in modeling eclipse conditions. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of these differentiable models in spaceflight mechanics computations.</description>

      <title>Non-Maxwellian Ion Distribution in the Equatorial and Auroral Electrojets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong electric fields in the auroral and equatorial electrojets can distort the background ion distribution function away from Maxwellian. We developed a collisional plasma kinetic model using the Boltzmann equation and a simple BGK collision operator which predicts a relatively simple relationship between the intensity of the background electric field and the resulting ion distribution function. To test the model, we perform 3-D plasma particle-in-cell simulations and compare the results to the model. The simulation applies an elastic collision operator assuming a constant ion-neutral collision rate. These simulations show less ion heating in the Pedersen direction than the analytic model but show similar overall heating. The model overestimates the heating in the Pedersen direction because the simple BGK operator includes no angular collisional scattering in the ion velocity space. On the other hand, the fully-kinetic particle-in-cell code is able to capture the physics of ion scattering in 3-D and therefore heats ions more isotropically. Although the simple BGK analytic theory does not precisely model the non-Maxwellian ion distribution function, it does capture the overall momentum and energy flows and therefore can provide the basis of further analysis of E-region wave evolution.</description>

      <title>Estimated Heating Rates Due to Cyclotron Damping of Ion-scale Waves Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via the cyclotron resonance, with such damping expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find such ion-scale waves are observed during $20.37\%$ of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Case studies on pre-eruptive X-class flares using R-value in the lower solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R-value is a measure of the strength of photospheric magnetic Polarity Inversion Lines (PILs) in Active Regions (ARs). This work investigates the possibility of a relation between R-value variations and the occurrence of X-class flares in ARs, not in the solar photosphere, as usual, but above it in regions, closer to where flares occur. The modus operandi is to extrapolate the Solar Dynamic Observatory's (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetogram data up to a height of 3.24 Mm above the photosphere and then compute the R-value based on the extrapolated magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that certain flare-predictive parameters such as the horizontal gradient of the vertical magnetic field and magnetic helicity may improve flare prediction lead times significantly if studied at a specific height range above the photosphere, called the Optimal Height Range (OHR). Here we define the OHR as a collection of heights where a sudden but sustained increase in R-value is found. For the eight case studies discussed in this paper, our results indicate that it is possible for OHRs to exist in the low solar atmosphere (between 0.36 - 3.24 Mm), where R-value spikes occur 48-68 hrs before the first X-class flare of an emerging AR. The temporal evolution of R-value before the first X-class flare for an emerging AR is also found to be distinct from that of non-flaring ARs. For X-class flares associated with non-emerging ARs, an OHR could not be found.</description>
