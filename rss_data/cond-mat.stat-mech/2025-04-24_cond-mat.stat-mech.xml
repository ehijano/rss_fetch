      <title>The need for statistical physics in Africa: perspective and an illustration in drug delivery problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of statistical physics in Africa is in its nascent stages, yet its application holds immense promise for advancing emerging research trends on the continent. This perspective paper, a product of a two-week workshop on biophysics in Morogoro (Tanzania), aims to illuminate the potential of statistical physics in regional scientific research. We employ in-silico atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the loading and delivery capabilities of lecithin nanolipids for niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug. Our simulations reveal that the loading capacity and interaction strength between lecithin nanolipids and niclosamide improve with increased lecithin concentrations. We perform a free-energy landscape analysis which uncovers two distinct metastable conformations of niclosamide within both the aqueous phase and the lecithin nanolipids. Over a simulation period of half a microsecond, lecithin nanolipids self-assemble into a spherical monolayer structure, providing detailed atomic-level insights into their interactions with niclosamide. These findings underscore the potential of lecithin nanolipids as efficient drug delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical gauge invariance of statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gauge invariance against phase space shifting in nonequilibrium systems, as represented by time-dependent many-body Hamiltonians that drive an initial ensemble out of thermal equilibrium. The theory gives rise to gauge correlation functions that characterize spatial and temporal inhomogeneity with microscopic resolution on the one-body level. Analyzing the dynamical gauge invariance allows one to identify a specific localized shift gauge current as a fundamental nonequilibrium observable that characterizes particle-based dynamics. When averaged over the nonequilibrium ensemble, the shift current vanishes identically, which constitutes an exact nonequilibrium conservation law that generalizes the Yvon-Born-Green equilibrium balance of the vanishing sum of ideal, interparticle, and external forces. Any given observable is associated with a corresponding dynamical hyperforce density and hypercurrent correlation function. An exact nonequilibrium sum rule interrelates these one-body functions, in generalization of the recent hyperforce balance for equilibrium systems. We demonstrate the physical consequences of the dynamical gauge invariance using both harmonically confined ideal gas setups, for which we present analytical solutions, and molecular dynamics simulations of interacting systems, for which we demonstrate the shift current and hypercurrent correlation functions to be accessible both via finite-difference methods and via trajectory-based automatic differentiation. We show that the theory constitutes a starting point for developing nonequilibrium reduced-variance sampling algorithms and for investigating thermally-activated barrier crossing.</description>

      <title>Long-range four-body interactions in the Hamiltonian mean field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a Hamiltonian mean field model with long-range four-body interactions is proposed. The model describes a long-range mean-field system in which N unit-mass particles move on a unit circle. Each particle theta_i interacts with any three other particles through an infinite-range cosine potential with an attractive interaction (epsilon &gt; 0). By applying a method that remaps the average phase of global particle pairs onto a new unit circle, and using the saddle-point technique, the partition function is solved analytically after introducing four-body interactions, yielding expressions for the free energy f and the energy per particle U. These results were further validated through numerical simulations. The results show that the system undergoes a second-order phase transition at the critical energy U_c. Specifically, the critical energy corresponds to U_c = 0.32 when the coupling constant epsilon = 5, and U_c = 0.63 when epsilon = 10. Finally, we calculated the system's largest Lyapunov exponent lambda and kinetic energy fluctuations Sigma through numerical simulations. It is found that the peak of the largest Lyapunov exponent lambda occurs slightly below the critical energy U_c, which is consistent with the point of maximum kinetic energy fluctuations Sigma. And there is a scaling law of Sigma / N^(1/2) proportional to lambda between them.</description>

      <title>Thermally quenched metastable phase in the Ising model with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal quenching has been used to find metastable materials such as hard steels and metallic glasses. More recently, quenching-based phase control has been applied to correlated electron systems that exhibit metal--insulator, magnetic or superconducting transitions. Despite the discovery of metastable electronic phases, however, how metastability is achieved through the degrees of freedom, which can vary even at low temperatures such as those of an electron, is unclear. Here, we show a thermally quenched metastable phase in the Ising model without conservation of magnetization by Monte Carlo simulations. When multiple types of interactions that stabilize different long-range orders are introduced, the ordering kinetics divergently slow toward low temperatures, meaning that the system will reach a low temperature without ordering if the cooling rate is high enough. Quantitative analysis of the divergent behavior suggests that the energy barrier for eliminating the local structure of competing orders is the origin of this metastability. Thus, the present simulations show that competing interactions play a key role in realizing metastability.</description>

Abstract: We develop, in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a method to compute correlation functions when the CFT is governed by the Lindblad equation for open quantum systems, via the AdS theory. Using a simple example in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we demonstrate that the predictions of the AdS theory based on our method match the direct computations in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Classical Estimation of the Free Energy and Quantum Gibbs Sampling from the Markov Entropy Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Markov Entropy Decomposition, a classical convex relaxation algorithm introduced by Poulin and Hastings to approximate the free energy in quantum spin lattices. We identify a sufficient condition for its convergence, namely the decay of the effective interaction. We prove that this condition is satisfied for systems in 1D at any temperature as well as in the high-temperature regime under a certain commutativity condition on the Hamiltonian. This yields polynomial and quasi-polynomial time approximation algorithms in these settings, respectively. Furthermore, the decay of the effective interaction implies the decay of the conditional mutual information for the Gibbs state of the system. We then use this fact to devise a rounding scheme that maps the solution of the convex relaxation to a global state and show that the scheme can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, thus proving efficiency of quantum Gibbs sampling under our assumption of decay of the effective interaction.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional $q$-state modified Potts model and its thermodynamic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its introduction, the Potts model has gained widespread popularity across various fields due to its diverse applications. Even minor advancements in this model continue to captivate scientists worldwide, and small modifications often intrigue researchers from different disciplines. This paper investigates a one-dimensional \(q\)-state modified Potts model influenced by an external magnetic field. By leveraging the transfer matrix method, exact expressions are derived for key thermodynamic quantities, including free energy, entropy, magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat capacity. Numerical analyses explore how these thermodynamic functions vary with relevant parameters, offering insights into the system's behavior. Additionally, the asymptotic properties of these quantities are examined in the limiting cases \(T \to 0\) and \(T \to \infty\). The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the model's thermodynamic characteristics and highlight its potential applications across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation, Zero Modes, and Collective Bound States in Constrained Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained models were originally introduced to capture slow relaxation in glassy systems, where dynamics are hindered by local constraints instead of energy barriers. Their quantum counterparts have recently drawn attention for exhibiting highly degenerate eigenstates at zero energy -- known as zero modes -- stemming from chiral symmetry. Yet, the structure and implications of these zero modes remain poorly understood. In this work, we focus on the properties of the zero mode subspace in quantum kinetically constrained models with a $U(1)$ particle-conservation symmetry. We use the $U(1)$ East, which lacks inversion symmetry, and the inversion-symmetric $U(1)$ East-West models to illustrate our two main results. First, we observe that the simultaneous presence of constraints and chiral symmetry generally leads to a parametric increase in the number of zero modes due to the fragmentation of the many-body Hilbert space into disconnected sectors. Second, we generalize the concept of compact localized states from single particle physics and introduce the notion of collective bound states. We formulate sufficient criteria for their existence, arguing that the degenerate zero mode subspace plays a central role, and demonstrate bound states in both example models. Our results motivate a systematic study of bound states and their relation to ergodicity breaking, transport, and other properties of quantum kinetically constrained models.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring energy levels in quantum systems via Hamiltonian control parameters is essential for designing quantum thermodynamic devices and materials. However, conventional methods for manipulating finite-size systems, such as tuning external fields or system size, typically lead to uniform spectral shifts, limiting precise control. A recently introduced technique, called the size-invariant shape transformation, overcomes this by introducing a new control parameter that deforms the potential landscape without altering system size, enabling nonuniform level scaling. This shape parameter gives rise to quantum shape effects in confined systems, conceptually distinct from quantum size effects. We explore the limits of this phenomenon by asking: what is the minimal system in which such spectral behavior can emerge? We show that even a two-level system can exhibit thermodynamic consequences of quantum shape effects, including spontaneous transitions into lower-entropy states, a feature absent in classical thermodynamics for non-interacting systems. We identify the origin as geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling, where the ground-state energy and level spacing respond oppositely to shape changes. This extends to many-level systems, where the thermally averaged level spacing and ground-state energy evolve in opposite directions. We construct spontaneity maps revealing energy- and entropy-driven spontaneous processes. These behaviors emerge under quasistatic, isothermal deformations and show how geometry alone can induce thermodynamic effects typically exclusive to interacting or open systems. Our results offer a broadly applicable route to spectral gap control in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Network Sampling: An Overview and Comparative Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.</description>

      <title>Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives birth to topological insulators that are robust against sufficiently weak randomness, inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation of a trivial insulation. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-species generalization of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with a ``no-passing" constraint, forbidding overtaking, on a one-dimensional open chain. This no-passing rule fragments the Hilbert space into an exponential number of disjoint sectors labeled by the particle sequence, leading to relaxation dynamics that depend sensitively on the initial ordering. We construct exact matrix-product steady states in every particle sequence sector and derive closed-form expressions for the particle-number distribution and two-point particle correlation functions. In the two-species case, we identify a parameter regime where some sectors relax in finite time while others exhibit metastable relaxation dynamics, revealing the coexistence of fast and slow dynamics and strong particle sequence sector dependence. Our results uncover a novel mechanism for non-equilibrium metastability arising from Hilbert space fragmentation in exclusion processes.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Free-Parafermion Solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic characterisation of when a quantum spin model admits an exact solution via a mapping to free parafermions. Our characterisation is based on the concept of a frustration graph, which represents the commutation relations between Weyl operators of a Hamiltonian. We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.</description>

      <title>The surface code beyond Pauli channels: Logical noise coherence, information-theoretic measures, and errorfield-double phenomenology</title>

Abstract: We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large-scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique</title>

Abstract: In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g. the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferromagnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states and recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>
