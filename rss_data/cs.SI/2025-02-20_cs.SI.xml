      <title>Community Notes Moderate Engagement With and Diffusion of False Information Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks scaffold the diffusion of information on social media. Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,074 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 45.7% in reposts, 43.5% in likes, 22.9% in replies, and 14.0% in views after being attached. Over the posts' entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.4% fewer reposts, 13.0% fewer likes, 7.3% fewer replies, and 5.7% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep, but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Agnostic Social Influence Maximization in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Influence Maximization (IM) problem aims to find a small set of influential users to maximize their influence spread in a social network. Traditional methods rely on fixed diffusion models with known parameters, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. In contrast, graph representation learning-based methods have gained wide attention for overcoming this limitation by learning user representations to capture influence characteristics. However, existing studies are built on Euclidean space, which fails to effectively capture the latent hierarchical features of social influence distribution. As a result, users' influence spread cannot be effectively measured through the learned representations. To alleviate these limitations, we propose HIM, a novel diffusion model agnostic method that leverages hyperbolic representation learning to estimate users' potential influence spread from social propagation data. HIM consists of two key components. First, a hyperbolic influence representation module encodes influence spread patterns from network structure and historical influence activations into expressive hyperbolic user representations. Hence, the influence magnitude of users can be reflected through the geometric properties of hyperbolic space, where highly influential users tend to cluster near the space origin. Second, a novel adaptive seed selection module is developed to flexibly and effectively select seed users using the positional information of learned user representations. Extensive experiments on five network datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our method for the IM problem with unknown diffusion model parameters, highlighting its potential for large-scale real-world social networks.</description>

      <title>Environmental Influences on Collaboration Network Evolution: A Historical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analysed two large collaboration networks -- the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020) -- to quantify network responses to major historical events. Our analysis revealed four properties of network-environment interaction. First, historical events can influence network evolution, with effects persisting far longer than previously recognised; the academic network showed 45\% declines during World Wars and 90\% growth during La Belle Epoque. Second, node and edge processes exhibited different environmental sensitivities; while node addition/removal tracked historical events, edge formation maintained stable statistical properties even during major disruptions. Third, different collaboration networks showed distinct response patterns; academic networks displayed sharp disruptions and rapid recoveries, while entertainment networks showed gradual changes and greater resilience. Fourth, both networks developed increasing resilience. Our results provide new insights for modelling network evolution and managing collaborative systems during periods of external disruption.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Research Portfolio For Semantic Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citation metrics are widely used to assess academic impact but suffer from social biases, including institutional prestige and journal visibility. Here we introduce rXiv Semantic Impact (XSI), a novel framework that predicts research impact by analyzing how scientific semantic graphs evolve in underlying fabric of science. Rather than counting citations, XSI tracks the evolution of research concepts in the academic knowledge graph (KG). Starting with a construction of a comprehensive KG from 324K biomedical publications (2003-2025), we demonstrate that XSI can predict a paper's future semantic impact (SI) with remarkable accuracy ($R^2$ = 0.69) three years in advance. We leverage these predictions to develop an optimization framework for research portfolio selection that systematically outperforms random allocation. We propose SI as a complementary metric to citations and present XSI as a tool to guide funding and publishing decisions, enhancing research impact while mitigating risk.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms to improve fair information access in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting $k$ seed nodes in a network to maximize the minimum probability of activation under an independent cascade beginning at these seeds. The motivation is to promote fairness by ensuring that even the least advantaged members of the network have good access to information. Our problem can be viewed as a variant of the classic influence maximization objective, but it appears somewhat more difficult to solve: only heuristics are known. Moreover, the scalability of these methods is sharply constrained by the need to repeatedly estimate access probabilities.
  We design and evaluate a suite of $10$ new scalable algorithms which crucially do not require probability estimation. To facilitate comparison with the state-of-the-art, we make three more contributions which may be of broader interest. We introduce a principled method of selecting a pairwise information transmission parameter used in experimental evaluations, as well as a new performance metric which allows for comparison of algorithms across a range of values for the parameter $k$. Finally, we provide a new benchmark corpus of $174$ networks drawn from $6$ domains. Our algorithms retain most of the performance of the state-of-the-art while reducing running time by orders of magnitude. Specifically, a meta-learner approach is on average only $20\%$ less effective than the state-of-the-art on held-out data, but about $75-130$ times faster. Further, the meta-learner's performance exceeds the state-of the-art on about $20\%$ of networks, and the magnitude of its running time advantage is maintained on much larger networks.</description>

      <title>Why You've Got Mail: Evaluating Inbox Privacy Implications of Email Marketing Practices in Online Apps and Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the widespread perception that personal data, such as email addresses, may be shared or sold without informed user consent, investigating whether these concerns are reflected in actual practices of popular online services and apps. Over the course of a year, we collected and analyzed the source, volume, frequency, and content of emails received by users after signing up for the 150 most popular online services and apps across various sectors. By examining patterns in email communications, we aim to identify consistent strategies used across industries, including potential signs of third-party data sharing. This analysis provides a critical evaluation of how email marketing tactics may intersect with data-sharing practices, with important implications for consumer privacy and regulatory oversight. Our study findings, conducted post-CCPA and GDPR, indicate that while no unknown third-party spam email was detected, internal and authorized third-party email marketing practices were pervasive, with companies frequently sending promotional and CRM emails despite opt-out preferences. The framework established in this work is designed to be scalable, allowing for continuous monitoring, and can be extended to include a more diverse set of apps and services for broader analysis, ultimately contributing to transparency in email address privacy practices.</description>

      <title>Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and item providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raises the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias, and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve item-side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) Fairness-aware attention, which incorporates the dot product in the normalization process of GNNs to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees. ii) Heterophily feature weighting, to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. To evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates unfairness and popularity bias on the item side but also achieves superior accuracy on the user side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</description>
