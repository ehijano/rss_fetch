      <title>Gaining Insights into Group-Level Course Difficulty via Differential Course Functioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curriculum Analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to ensure the quality of educational programs. One desirable property of courses within curricula is that they are not unexpectedly more difficult for students of different backgrounds. While prior work points to likely variations in course difficulty across student groups, robust methodologies for capturing such variations are scarce, and existing approaches do not adequately decouple course-specific difficulty from students' general performance levels. The present study introduces Differential Course Functioning (DCF) as an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based CA methodology. DCF controls for student performance levels and examines whether significant differences exist in how distinct student groups succeed in a given course. Leveraging data from over 20,000 students at a large public university, we demonstrate DCF's ability to detect inequities in undergraduate course difficulty across student groups described by grade achievement. We compare major pairs with high co-enrollment and transfer students to their non-transfer peers. For the former, our findings suggest a link between DCF effect sizes and the alignment of course content to student home department motivating interventions targeted towards improving course preparedness. For the latter, results suggest minor variations in course-specific difficulty between transfer and non-transfer students. While this is desirable, it also suggests that interventions targeted toward mitigating grade achievement gaps in transfer students should encompass comprehensive support beyond enhancing preparedness for individual courses. By providing more nuanced and equitable assessments of academic performance and difficulties experienced by diverse student populations, DCF could support policymakers, course articulation officers, and student advisors.</description>

      <title>Improving the Fairness of Deep-Learning, Short-term Crime Prediction with Under-reporting-aware Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning crime predictive tools use past crime data and additional behavioral datasets to forecast future crimes. Nevertheless, these tools have been shown to suffer from unfair predictions across minority racial and ethnic groups. Current approaches to address this unfairness generally propose either pre-processing methods that mitigate the bias in the training datasets by applying corrections to crime counts based on domain knowledge or in-processing methods that are implemented as fairness regularizers to optimize for both accuracy and fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that combines the power of these two approaches to increase prediction fairness. Our results show that the proposed model improves the fairness of crime predictions when compared to models with in-processing de-biasing approaches and with models without any type of bias correction, albeit at the cost of reducing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Needs Adaptive Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the speed of its development, broad scope of application, and its ability to augment human performance, generative AI challenges the very notions of governance, trust, and human agency. The technology's capacity to mimic human knowledge work, feedback loops including significant uptick in users, research, investor, policy, and media attention, data and compute resources, all lead to rapidly increasing capabilities. For those reasons, adaptive governance, where AI governance and AI co-evolve, is essential for governing generative AI. In sharp contrast to traditional governance's regulatory regimes that are based on a mix of rigid one-and-done provisions for disclosure, registration and risk management, which in the case of AI carry the potential for regulatory misalignment, this paper argues that generative AI calls for adaptive governance. We define adaptive governance in the context of AI and outline an adaptive AI governance framework. We outline actors, roles, as well as both shared and actors-specific policy activities. We further provide examples of how the framework could be operationalized in practice. We then explain that the adaptive AI governance stance is not without its risks and limitations, such as insufficient oversight, insufficient depth, regulatory uncertainty, and regulatory capture, and provide potential approaches to fix these shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Countrywide natural experiment reveals impact of built environment on physical activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines. More walkable built environments have the potential to increase activity across the population. However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, few or single locations, over-reliance on self-reported measures, and cross-sectional designs. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging a large U.S. cohort of smartphone users (N=2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behavior changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively-measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 U.S. cities. By analyzing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases in walkability are associated with significant increases in physical activity after relocation (and vice versa). These changes hold across subpopulations of different genders, age, and body-mass index (BMI), and are sustained over three months after moving.The added activity observed after moving to a more walkable location is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), which is linked to an array of associated health benefits across the life course. A simulation experiment demonstrates that substantial walkability improvements (i.e., bringing all US locations to the walkability level of Chicago or Philadelphia) may lead to 10.3% or 33 million more Americans meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines. Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the importance of the built environment in directly improving health-enhancing physical activity, in addition to offering potential guidance for public policy activities in this area.</description>

      <title>The Reasonable Person Standard for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly incorporated into domains where human behavior has set the norm, a challenge for AI governance and AI alignment research is to regulate their behavior in a way that is useful and constructive for society. One way to answer this question is to ask: how do we govern the human behavior that the models are emulating? To evaluate human behavior, the American legal system often uses the "Reasonable Person Standard." The idea of "reasonable" behavior comes up in nearly every area of law. The legal system often judges the actions of parties with respect to what a reasonable person would have done under similar circumstances. This paper argues that the reasonable person standard provides useful guidelines for the type of behavior we should develop, probe, and stress-test in models. It explains how reasonableness is defined and used in key areas of the law using illustrative cases, how the reasonable person standard could apply to AI behavior in each of these areas and contexts, and how our societal understanding of "reasonable" behavior provides useful technical goals for AI researchers.</description>

      <title>Experiences from Integrating Large Language Model Chatbots into the Classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we provided students an unfiltered access to a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) chatbot. The chatbot was intentionally designed to mimic proprietary commercial chatbots such as ChatGPT where the chatbot has not been tailored for the educational context; the underlying engine was OpenAI GPT-4. The chatbot was integrated into online learning materials of three courses. One of the courses focused on software engineering with LLMs, while the two other courses were not directly related to LLMs. Our results suggest that only a minority of students engage with the chatbot in the courses that do not relate to LLMs. At the same time, unsurprisingly, nearly all students in the LLM-focused course leveraged the chatbot. In all courses, the majority of the LLM usage came from a few superusers, whereas the majority of the students did not heavily use the chatbot even though it was readily available and effectively provided a free access to the OpenAI GPT-4 model. We also observe that in addition to students using the chatbot for course-specific purposes, many use the chatbot for their own purposes. These results suggest that the worst fears of educators -- all students overrelying on LLMs -- did not materialize even when the chatbot access was unfiltered. We finally discuss potential reasons for the low usage, suggesting the need for more tailored and scaffolded LLM experiences targeted for specific types of student use cases.</description>

      <title>On Ambiguity and the Expressive Function of Law: The Role of Pragmatics in Smart Legal Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a long paper, an essay, on ambiguity, pragmatics, legal ecosystems, and the expressive function of law. It is divided into two parts and fifteen sections. The first part (Pragmatics) addresses ambiguity from the perspective of linguistic and cognitive pragmatics in the legal field. The second part (Computing) deals with this issue from the point of view of human-centered design and artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on the notion and modelling of rules and what it means to comply with the rules. This is necessary for the scaffolding of smart legal ecosystems (SLE). I will develop this subject with the example of the architecture, information flows, and smart ecosystem of OPTIMAI, an EU project of Industry 4.0 for zero-defect manufacturing (Optimizing Manufacturing Processes through Artificial Intelligence and Virtualization).</description>

      <title>Everywhere &amp; Nowhere: Envisioning a Computing Continuum for Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging data-driven scientific workflows are seeking to leverage distributed data sources to understand end-to-end phenomena, drive experimentation, and facilitate important decision-making. Despite the exponential growth of available digital data sources at the edge, and the ubiquity of non trivial computational power for processing this data, realizing such science workflows remains challenging. This paper explores a computing continuum that is everywhere and nowhere -- one spanning resources at the edges, in the core and in between, and providing abstractions that can be harnessed to support science. It also introduces recent research in programming abstractions that can express what data should be processed and when and where it should be processed, and autonomic middleware services that automate the discovery of resources and the orchestration of computations across these resources.</description>

      <title>A Unified View of Group Fairness Tradeoffs Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel information-theoretic perspective on the relationship between prominent group fairness notions in machine learning, namely statistical parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity. It is well known that simultaneous satisfiability of these three fairness notions is usually impossible, motivating practitioners to resort to approximate fairness solutions rather than stringent satisfiability of these definitions. However, a comprehensive analysis of their interrelations, particularly when they are not exactly satisfied, remains largely unexplored. Our main contribution lies in elucidating an exact relationship between these three measures of (un)fairness by leveraging a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID). In this work, we leverage PID to identify the granular regions where these three measures of (un)fairness overlap and where they disagree with each other leading to potential tradeoffs. We also include numerical simulations to complement our results.</description>

      <title>Accessible Adventures: Teaching Accessibility to High School Students Through Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accessibility education has been rarely incorporated into the high school curricula. This is a missed opportunity to equip next-generation software designers and decision-makers with knowledge, awareness, and empathy regarding accessibility and disabilities. We taught accessibility to students (N=93) in a midwestern high school through empathy-driven games and interviewed three Computer Science high school teachers and one librarian who taught programming. Accessibility education is currently insufficient in high school, facing challenges such as teachers' knowledge and conflicted curriculum goals. The students exhibited increased knowledge and awareness of accessibility and empathy for people with disabilities after playing the games. With this education outreach, we aim to provide insights into teaching next-generation software designers about accessibility by leveraging games.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for learning value-aligned policies considering admissibility relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of \emph{value awareness engineering} claims that software agents and systems should be value-aware, i.e. they must make decisions in accordance with human values. In this context, such agents must be capable of explicitly reasoning as to how far different courses of action are aligned with these values. For this purpose, values are often modelled as preferences over states or actions, which are then aggregated to determine the sequences of actions that are maximally aligned with a certain value. Recently, additional value admissibility constraints at this level have been considered as well.
  However, often relaxed versions of these constraints are needed, and this increases considerably the complexity of computing value-aligned policies. To obtain efficient algorithms that make value-aligned decisions considering admissibility relaxation, we propose the use of learning techniques, in particular, we have used constrained reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we present two algorithms, $\epsilon\text{-}ADQL$ for strategies based on local alignment and its extension $\epsilon\text{-}CADQL$ for a sequence of decisions. We have validated their efficiency in a water distribution problem in a drought scenario.</description>

      <title>FRAPPE: A Group Fairness Framework for Post-Processing Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite achieving promising fairness-error trade-offs, in-processing mitigation techniques for group fairness cannot be employed in numerous practical applications with limited computation resources or no access to the training pipeline of the prediction model. In these situations, post-processing is a viable alternative. However, current methods are tailored to specific problem settings and fairness definitions and hence, are not as broadly applicable as in-processing. In this work, we propose a framework that turns any regularized in-processing method into a post-processing approach. This procedure prescribes a way to obtain post-processing techniques for a much broader range of problem settings than the prior post-processing literature. We show theoretically and through extensive experiments that our framework preserves the good fairness-error trade-offs achieved with in-processing and can improve over the effectiveness of prior post-processing methods. Finally, we demonstrate several advantages of a modular mitigation strategy that disentangles the training of the prediction model from the fairness mitigation, including better performance on tasks with partial group labels.</description>

      <title>ChaosBench: A Multi-Channel, Physics-Based Benchmark for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Climate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of climate in the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale is crucial for disaster preparedness and robust decision making amidst climate change. Yet, forecasting beyond the weather timescale is challenging because it deals with problems other than initial conditions, including boundary interaction, butterfly effect, and our inherent lack of physical understanding. At present, existing benchmarks tend to have shorter forecasting range of up-to 15 days, do not include a wide range of operational baselines, and lack physics-based constraints for explainability. Thus, we propose ChaosBench, a challenging benchmark to extend the predictability range of data-driven weather emulators to S2S timescale. First, ChaosBench is comprised of variables beyond the typical surface-atmospheric ERA5 to also include ocean, ice, and land reanalysis products that span over 45 years to allow for full Earth system emulation that respects boundary conditions. We also propose physics-based, in addition to deterministic and probabilistic metrics, to ensure a physically-consistent ensemble that accounts for butterfly effect. Furthermore, we evaluate on a diverse set of physics-based forecasts from four national weather agencies as baselines to our data-driven counterpart such as ClimaX, PanguWeather, GraphCast, and FourCastNetV2. Overall, we find methods originally developed for weather-scale applications fail on S2S task: their performance simply collapse to an unskilled climatology. Nonetheless, we outline and demonstrate several strategies that can potentially extend the predictability range of existing weather emulators, including the use of ensembles and robust control of error propagation. Our benchmark, datasets, and instructions are available at https://leap-stc.github.io/ChaosBench.</description>

      <title>Unintended Impacts of LLM Alignment on Global Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before being deployed for user-facing applications, developers align Large Language Models (LLMs) to user preferences through a variety of procedures, such as Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Current evaluations of these procedures focus on benchmarks of instruction following, reasoning, and truthfulness. However, human preferences are not universal, and aligning to specific preference sets may have unintended effects. We explore how alignment impacts performance along three axes of global representation: English dialects, multilingualism, and opinions from and about countries worldwide. Our results show that current alignment procedures create disparities between English dialects and global opinions. We find alignment improves capabilities in several languages. We conclude by discussing design decisions that led to these unintended impacts and recommendations for more equitable preference tuning. We make our code and data publicly available on Github.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

Abstract: AI systems have been shown to produce unfair results for certain subgroups of population, highlighting the need to understand bias on certain sensitive attributes. Current research often falls short, primarily focusing on the subgroups characterized by a single sensitive attribute, while neglecting the nature of intersectional fairness of multiple sensitive attributes. This paper focuses on its one fundamental aspect by discovering diverse high-bias subgroups under intersectional sensitive attributes. Specifically, we propose a Bias-Guided Generative Network (BGGN). By treating each bias value as a reward, BGGN efficiently generates high-bias intersectional sensitive attributes. Experiments on real-world text and image datasets demonstrate a diverse and efficient discovery of BGGN. To further evaluate the generated unseen but possible unfair intersectional sensitive attributes, we formulate them as prompts and use modern generative AI to produce new texts and images. The results of frequently generating biased data provides new insights of discovering potential unfairness in popular modern generative AI systems. Warning: This paper contains generative examples that are offensive in nature.</description>
