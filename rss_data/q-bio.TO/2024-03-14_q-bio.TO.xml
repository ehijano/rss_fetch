      <title>Morphological instability at topological defects in a three-dimensional vertex model for spherical epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelial monolayers are a central building block of complex organisms. Topological defects have emerged as important elements for single cell behavior in flat epithelia. Here we theoretically study such defects in a three-dimensional vertex model for spherical epithelia like cysts or intestinal organoids. We find that they lead to the same generic morphological instability to an icosahedral shape as it is known from spherical elastic shells like virus capsids, polymerized vesicles or buckyballs. We derive analytical expressions for the effective stretching and bending moduli as a function of the parameters of the vertex model, in excellent agreement with computer simulations. These equations accurately predict both the buckling of a flat epithelial monolayer under uniaxial compression and the faceting transition around the topological defects in spherical epithelia. We further show that localized apico-basal tension asymmetries allow them to reduce the transition threshold to small system sizes.</description>

      <title>Anatomically aware simulation of patient-specific glioblastoma xenografts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patient-derived cells (PDC) mouse xenografts are increasingly important tools in glioblastoma (GBM) research, essential to investigate case-specific growth patterns and treatment responses. Despite the central role of xenograft models in the field, few good simulation models are available to probe the dynamics of tumor growth and to support therapy design. We therefore propose a new framework for the patient-specific simulation of GBM in the mouse brain. Unlike existing methods, our simulations leverage a high-resolution map of the mouse brain anatomy to yield patient-specific results that are in good agreement with experimental observations. To facilitate the fitting of our model to histological data, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation. Because our model uses few parameters, reflecting growth, invasion and niche dependencies, it is well suited for case comparisons and for probing treatment effects. We demonstrate how our model can be used to simulate different treatment by perturbing the different model parameters. We expect in silico replicates of mouse xenograft tumors can improve the assessment of therapeutic outcomes and boost the statistical power of preclinical GBM studies.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Polarimetric Properties in Various Brain Tumor Types Using Wide-Field Imaging Mueller Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuro-oncological surgery is the primary brain cancer treatment, yet it faces challenges with gliomas due to their invasiveness and the need to preserve neurological function. Hence, radical resection is often unfeasible, highlighting the importance of precise tumor margin delineation to prevent neurological deficits and improve prognosis. Imaging Mueller polarimetry, an effective modality in various organ tissues, seems a promising approach for tumor delineation in neurosurgery. To further assess its use, we characterized the polarimetric properties by analysing 45 polarimetric measurements of 27 fresh brain tumor samples, including different tumor types with a strong focus on gliomas. Our study integrates a wide-field imaging Mueller polarimetric system and a novel neuropathology protocol, correlating polarimetric and histological data for accurate tissue identification. An image processing pipeline facilitated the alignment and overlay of polarimetric images and histological masks. Variations in depolarization values were observed for grey and white matter of brain tumor tissue, while differences in linear retardance were seen only within white matter of brain tumor tissue. Notably, we identified pronounced optical axis azimuth randomization within tumor regions. This study lays the foundation for machine learning-based brain tumor segmentation algorithms using polarimetric data, facilitating intraoperative diagnosis and decision making.</description>
