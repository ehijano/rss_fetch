      <title>The Impact of Extended CO$_2$ Cross Sections on Temperate Anoxic Planet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our interpretation of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric spectra will always be limited by the accuracy of the data we use as input in our forward and retrieval models. Ultraviolet molecular absorption cross sections are one category of these essential model inputs; however, they are often poorly characterized at the longest wavelengths relevant to photo-dissociation. Photolysis reactions dominate the chemical kinetics of temperate terrestrial planet atmospheres. One molecule of particular importance is CO$_2$, which is likely present in all terrestrial planet atmospheres. The photolysis of CO$_2$ can introduce CO and O, as well as shield tropospheric water vapor from undergoing photolysis. This is important because H$_2$O photolysis produces OH, which serves as a major reactive sink to many atmospheric trace gases. Here, we construct CO$_2$ cross-section prescriptions at 195K and 300K extrapolated beyond 200 nm from measured cross sections. We compare results from the implementation of these new cross sections to the most commonly used CO$_2$ prescriptions for temperate, terrestrial planets with Archean-like atmospheres. We generally find that the observational consequences of CO$_2$ dissociation beyond 200 nm is minimal so long as our least conservative (highest opacity) prescription can be ruled out. Moreover, implementing our recommended extended CO$_2$ cross sections does not substantially alter previous results showing the consequential photochemical impact of extended H$_2$O cross sections.</description>

      <title>Deep high-resolution L band spectroscopy in the $\beta$ Pictoris planetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beta Pictoris system, with its two directly imaged planets beta Pic b and beta Pic c and its well characterised debris disk, is a prime target for detailed characterisation of young planetary systems. Here, we present high-resolution and high-contrast LM band spectroscopy with CRIRES+ of the system, primarily for the purpose of atmospheric characterisation of beta Pic b. We developed methods for determining slit geometry and wavelength calibration based on telluric absorption and emission lines, as well as methods for PSF modelling and subtraction, and artificial planet injection, in order to extract and characterise planet spectra at a high S/N and spectral fidelity. Through cross-correlation with model spectra, we detected H2O absorption for planet b in each of the 13 individual observations spanning four different spectral settings. This provides a clear confirmation of previously detected water absorption, and allowed us to derive an exquisite precision on the rotational velocity of beta Pic b, v_rot = 20.36 +/- 0.31 km/s, which is consistent within error bars with previous determinations. We also observed a tentative H2O cross-correlation peak at the expected position and velocity of planet c; the feature is however not at a statistically significant level. Despite a higher sensitivity to SiO than earlier studies, we do not confirm a tentative SiO feature previously reported for planet b. When combining data from different epochs and different observing modes for the strong H2O feature of planet b, we find that the S/N grows considerably faster when sets of different spectral settings are combined, compared to when multiple data sets of the same spectral setting are combined. This implies that maximising spectral coverage is often more important than maximising integration depth when investigating exoplanetary atmospheres using cross-correlation techniques.</description>

      <title>Kinetic and photochemical disequilibrium in the potentially carbon-rich atmosphere of the warm-Jupiter WASP-69b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of the warm gas-giant WASP-69b has revealed the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, NH3, and C2H2 in its atmosphere. This study investigates the impact of vertical diffusion and photochemistry on its atmospheric composition, with a focus on the detected species plus HCN and CO2, to constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio. We utilize non-equilibrium gas-phase simulations to conduct a parameter study for vertical diffusion strength, local gas temperature, and C/O ratio. Our results indicate that a carbon-rich atmosphere enhances CH4 and C2H2 concentrations, while NH3 undergoes chemical conversion into HCN in carbon-rich, high-temperature environments. Consequently, HCN is abundantly produced in such atmospheres, though its strong spectral features remain undetected in WASP-69b. Photochemical production of HCN and C2H2 is highly sensitive to vertical diffusion strength, with weaker diffusion resulting in higher concentrations. Cross-correlation of synthetic spectra with observed data shows that models with C/O=2 best match observations, but models with C/O=0.55 and 0.9 lead to statistically equivalent fits, leaving the C/O ratio unconstrained. We highlight the importance of accurately modeling NH3 quenching at pressures greater than 100 bars. Models for WASP-69b capped at 100 bars bias cross-correlation fits towards carbon-rich values. We suggest that if the atmosphere of WASP-69b is indeed carbon-rich with a solar metallicity, future observations should reveal the presence of HCN.</description>

      <title>An investigation of the relationship between morphology and chemistry of the D-type spherules from the recovery expedition of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide: Implications for origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic spherules have largely been classified into S-, I-, and G-types according to their compositions, and are identified to have chondritic or achondritic materials as precursors. A recent recovery expedition attempted to sample fragments of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide retrieved roughly 850 magnetic particles, some of which have unknown origins. Among those identified were a new group of highly differentiated materials consisting of close to 160 specimens categorized as "D-type" particles. We studied the D-type particles with the goal of comparing their various morphological features to their chemical compositional groupings. Four morphological classifications are considered: "scoriaceous," "stubby," "blocky," and "vesicular." The specimens from the "scoriaceous" and "stubby" groups exhibit a spinel/magnetite rim in at least one instance, characteristic of atmospheric entry, and textures indicative of quenching such as dendritic microcrystalline structures, suggesting that a subset of specimens from these groups are candidates for materials of extraterrestrial origin. The particles exhibiting "blocky" and "vesicular" textures are likely to be terrestrial in origin, with no obvious quench features or signs of ablation. The D-type particles identified and characterized in this study have a spectrum of terrestrial and probable extraterrestrial origins.</description>

      <title>Empirical Constraints on Tidal Dissipation in Exoplanet Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbits of short-period exoplanets are sculpted by tidal dissipation. However, the mechanisms and associated efficiencies of these tidal interactions are poorly constrained. We present robust constraints on the tidal quality factors of short-period exoplanetary host stars through the usage of a novel empirical technique. The method is based on analyzing structures in the population-level distribution of tidal decay times, defined as the time remaining before a planet spirals into its host star due to stellar tides. Using simple synthetic planet population simulations and analytic theory, we show that there exists a steady-state portion of the decay time distribution with an approximately power-law form. This steady-state feature is clearly evident in the decay time distribution of the observed short-period planet population. We use this to constrain both the magnitude and frequency dependence of the stellar tidal quality factor and show that it must decrease sharply with planetary orbital period. Specifically, with $Q_{\star}' = Q_0 (P/2 \ \mathrm{days})^{\alpha}$, we find $10^{5.5} \lesssim Q_0 \lesssim 10^7$ and $-4.33 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -2$. Our results are most consistent with predictions from tidal resonance locking, in which the planets are locked into resonance with a tidally excited gravity mode in their host stars.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Gravitational Potential Analysis: From Clairaut to Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces an advanced novel theory for calculating non-linear Newtonian hydrostatic perturbations in the density, shape, and gravitational field of fluid stars and planets subjected to external tidal and rotational forces. The theory employs a Lie group approach using exponential mappings to derive exact differential equations for large gravitational field perturbations and the shape function, which describes the finite deformation of the body's figure. This approach lays the foundation for the precise analytic determination and numerical computation of the induced body's multipole moments and Love numbers with any desired degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Interplay between tidal flows and magnetic fields in nonlinear simulations of stellar and planetary convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets in close systems are magnetised but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses (and vice versa) and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in convective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to tidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal circularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital migration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as incompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially (rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its strength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be substantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong tidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large tidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial magnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can inhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell stresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and characterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfv\'en waves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is close to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of Pm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars, such that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Improving the stellar age determination through joint modeling of binarity and asteroseismology - Grid modeling of the seismic red-giant binary KIC 9163796</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Typical uncertainties of ages determined for single star giants from isochrone fitting using single-epoch spectroscopy and photometry without any additional constraints are 30-50 %. Binary systems, particularly double-lined spectroscopic (SB2) binaries, provide an opportunity to study the intricacies of internal stellar physics and better determine stellar parameters, particularly the stellar age. Aims. By using the constraints from binarity and asteroseismology, we aim to obtain precise age and stellar parameters for the red giant-subgiant binary system KIC 9163796, a system with a mass ratio of 1.015 but distinctly different positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Methods. We compute a multidimensional model grid of individual stellar models. From different combinations of figures of merit, we use the constraints drawn from binarity, spectroscopy, and asteroseismology to determine the stellar mass, chemical composition, and age of KIC 9163796. Results. Our combined-modeling approach leads to an age estimation of the binary system KIC 9163796 of 2.44$^{+0.25}_{-0.20}$ Gyr, which corresponds to a relative error in the age of 9 %. Furthermore, we found both components exhibiting equal initial helium abundance of 0.27 to 0.30, significantly higher than the primordial helium abundance, and an initial heavy metal abundance below the spectroscopic value. The masses of our models are in agreement with masses derived from the asteroseismic scaling relations. Conclusions. By exploiting the unique, distinct positions of KIC 9163796, we successfully demonstrated that combining asteroseismic and binary constraints leads to a significant improvement of precision in age estimation, that have a relative error below 10% for a giant star.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Widespread Hydrogen Sequestration within the Moon's South Polar Cold Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03911v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measured neutron flux from the Moons south polar region shows evidence of locally enhanced hydrogen concentrations, likely in the form of water ice, within most permanently shadowed regions (PSR), poleward of 77 deg S latitude. Results are consistent with the original findings of Watson et al, 1961, which found that the PSRs cryogenic surfaces create exclusive conditions for the sequestration of water ice, due to their extremely low sublimation rates. Widespread PSR hydrogenation is demonstrated in several studies by showing that the contrasting PSR area distribution is being instrumentally blurred. The PSRs expected hydrogen observations are correlated by their area fraction of the fixed 30 km diameter footprint area of the Collimated Sensor for Epithermal Neutrons (CSETN), which is part of the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The correlation indicates that the PSRs are similarly hydrogenated, with an expected concentration = 0.27 wt%, relative to that of the anhydrous reference terrain (lower bounds). Hydrogen concentrations are demonstrated to be correlated to maximum temperature distributions within the basins of Haworth, Shoemaker and Faustini PSRs. Cabeus-1 PSR shows an anomalously enhanced hydrogen concentration indicating a second process contributes to its hydrogen budget. Results are consistent with ongoing processes that introduce volatiles to the surface including outgassing, solar wind production with regolith silicates, and mixing from small scale meteor impacts and diurnal temperature variation. We validate the bandpass filter used to subtract CSETNs detection of uncollimated neutrons with profiles of several PSRs neutron suppression before and after processing.

      <title>A Possible Metal-Dominated Atmosphere Below the Thick Aerosols of GJ 1214 b Suggested by its JWST Panchromatic Transmission Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GJ1214b is the archetype sub-Neptune for which thick aerosols have prevented us from constraining its atmospheric properties for over a decade. In this study, we leverage the panchromatic transmission spectrum of GJ1214b established by HST and JWST to investigate its atmospheric properties using a suite of atmospheric radiative transfer, photochemistry, and aerosol microphysical models. We find that the combined HST, JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/MIRI spectrum can be well-explained by atmospheric models with an extremely high metallicity of [M/H]$\sim$3.5 and an extremely high haze production rate of $F_{\rm haze}{\sim}10^{-8}$--$10^{-7}$ g cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Such high atmospheric metallicity is suggested by the relatively strong CO2 feature compared to the haze absorption feature or the CH4 feature in the NIRSpec-G395H bandpass of 2.5--5 $\mu$m. The flat 5--12 $\mu$m MIRI spectrum also suggests a small scale height with a high atmospheric metallicity that is needed to suppress a prominent 6 $\mu$m haze feature. We tested the sensitivity of our interpretation to various assumptions for uncertain haze properties, such as optical constants and production rate, and all models tested here consistently suggest extremely high metallicity. Thus, we conclude that GJ1214b likely has a metal-dominated atmosphere where hydrogen is no longer the main atmospheric constituent. We also find that different assumptions for the haze production rate lead to distinct inferences for the atmospheric C/O ratio. We stress the importance of high precision follow-up observations to confirm the metal-dominated atmosphere and to constrain the C/O ratio, which provides further insights on the planet formation process. The confirmation of the metal-dominated atmosphere is particularly crucial, as it challenges the conventional understanding of interior structure and evolution of sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Detection and Characterisation of Giant Planets with Gaia Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrometric observations with Gaia are expected to play a valuable role in future exoplanet surveys. With current data from Gaia's third data release (DR3), we are sensitive to periods from less than 1 year to more than 4 years but, unlike radial velocity are not as restricted by the orbital inclination of a potential planet. The presence and potential properties of a companion affect the primary's renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) making this a valuable quantity in the search for exoplanets. Using this value and the fitted astrometric tracks from Gaia, we use Bayesian inference to constrain the mass and orbital parameters of companions in known systems. Combining this with radial velocity measurements, we show it is possible to independently measure mass and inclination and suggest HD 66141 b is a possible brown dwarf with maximum mass 23.9$^{+7.2}_{-6.4}$ M$_{\mathrm{J}}$. We show how this method may be applied to directly imaged planets in the future, using $\beta$-Pictoris c as an example but note that the host star is bright and active, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. We show how the next Gaia data release, which will include epoch astrometry, will allow us to accurately constrain orbital parameters from astrometric data alone, revolutionising future searches for exoplanets. Combining predicted observational limits on planet mass with theoretical distributions, we estimate the probability that a star with a given RUWE will host a detectable planet, which will be highly valuable in planning future surveys.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Cassini Images of Spokes in Saturn's Rings: Unusual Spoke Types and Seasonal Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spokes are localized clouds of fine particles that appear over the outer part of Saturn's B ring. Over the course of the Cassini Mission, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) obtained over 20,000 images of the outer B ring, providing the most comprehensive data set for quantifying spoke properties currently available. Consistent with prior work, we find that spokes typically appear as dark features when the lit side of the rings are viewed at low phase angles, and as bright features when the rings are viewed at high phase angles or the dark side of the rings are observed. However, we also find examples of spokes on the dark side of the rings that transition between being brighter and darker than the background ring as they move around the planet. Most interestingly, we also identify spokes that appear to be darker than the background ring near their center and brighter than the background ring near their edges. These "mixed spokes" indicate that the particle size distribution can vary spatially within a spoke. In addition, we document seasonal variations in the overall spoke activity over the course of the Cassini mission using statistics derived from lit-side imaging sequences. These statistics demonstrate that while spokes can be detected over a wide range of solar elevation angles, spoke activity increases dramatically when the Sun is within 10 degrees of the ring plane.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Temperature Variations In Protoplanetary disks: I. Linear Theory, Corotating Spirals, and Ring Formation</title>

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks can exhibit asymmetric temperature variations due to phenomena such as shadows cast by the inner disk or localized heating by young planets. We investigate the disk features induced by these asymmetric temperature variations. We find that spirals are initially excited, then break into two and reconnect to form rings. By carrying out linear analyses, we first study the spiral launching mechanism, and find that the effects of azimuthal temperature variations share similarities with effects of external potentials. Specifically, rotating temperature variations launch steady spiral structures at Lindblad resonances, which corotate with the temperature patterns. When the cooling time exceeds the orbital period, these spiral structures are significantly weakened, and a checkerboard pattern may appear. A temperature variation of about 10\% can induce spirals with order unity density perturbations, comparable to those generated by a thermal mass planet. We then study ring formation and find it is related to the coupling between azimuthal temperature variations and spirals outside the resonances. Such coupling leads to a radially varying angular momentum flux, which produces anomalous wave-driven accretion and forms dense rings separated by the wavelength of the waves. Finally, we speculate that spirals induced by temperature variations may contribute to disk accretion through non-linear wave steepening and dissipation. Overall, considering that irradiation determines the temperature structure of protoplanetary disks, the change of irradiation both spatially or/and temporarily may produce observable effects in protoplanetary disks, especially spirals and rings in outer disks beyond tens of AU.</description>

      <title>New ultracool dwarf candidates from multi-epoch WISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thirty years after the discovery of brown dwarfs, the search for these objects continues, particularly in the vicinity of the Sun. Objects near the Sun are characterized by large proper motions, making them seen as fast-moving objects. While the Gaia DR3 catalogue is a comprehensive source of proper motions, it lacks the depth needed for discovering fainter objects. Modern multi-epoch surveys, with their greater depth, offer a new opportunity for systematic search for ultracool dwarfs. The study aims to systematically search for high proper motion objects using the newly released catalogue of epochal WISE data in order to identify new brown dwarf candidates in the solar neighborhood, estimate their spectral types, distances and spatial velocities. We used recently released unTimely catalogue of epochal detections in unWISE coadds to search for objects with high proper motions using simple motion detection algorithm, combined with machine learning based artefact rejection routine. This method was used to identify objects with proper motions exceeding approximately 0.3 arcseconds per year. The identified objects were then cross-referenced with data from other large-scale sky surveys to further analyze their characteristics. The search yielded 21,885 moving objects with significant proper motions, 258 of which had not been previously published. All except 6 of them are compatible with being ultracool dwarfs. Among these, at least 33 were identified as most promising new T dwarf candidates, with estimated distances closer than about 40 parsecs, and effective temperatures less than 1300 K.</description>

      <title>Half a Million Binary Stars from the low resolution spectra of LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are prevalent yet challenging to detect. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify binary stars from low-resolution spectra obtained by the LAMOST survey. The CNN is trained on a dataset that distinguishes binaries from single main sequence stars based on their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Specifically, the training data labels stars with mass ratios between approximately 0.71 and 0.93 as intermediate mass ratio binaries, while excluding those beyond this range. The network achieves high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.949 on the test set. Its performance is further validated against known eclipsing binaries (97% detection rate) and binary stars identified by radial velocity variations (92% detection rate). Applying the trained CNN to a sample of one million main sequence stars from LAMOST DR10 and Gaia DR3 yields a catalog of 468,634 binary stars, which are mainly intermediate mass ratio binaries given the training data. This catalog includes 115 binary stars located beyond 10 kpc from the Sun and 128 cross-matched with known exoplanet hosts from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This new catalog provides a valuable resource for future research on the properties, formation, and evolution of binary systems, particularly for statistically characterizing large populations.</description>
