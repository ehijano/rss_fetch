      <title>Exbodiment: The Mind Made Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exbodiment describes mind outsourced to engineered matter and how matter reeducates mind. The constraints of exbodied matter encode elements of thought, channel decision-making, and constitute an important part of an extended computational phenotype. Here I provide an introduction and brief cultural history of exbodiment in music, natural history, cognition, and astrobiology. The "Helix of Exbodiment" is introduced to illustrate continuous feedback between mind and matter.</description>

      <title>A QUBO Formulation for the Generalized LinkedIn Queens and Takuzu/Tango Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a QUBO formulation designed to solve a series of generalisations of the LinkedIn queens game, a version of the N-queens problem, for the Takuzu game (or Binairo), for the most recent LinkedIn game, Tango, and for its generalizations. We adapt this formulation for several particular cases of the problem, as Tents &amp; Trees, by trying to optimise the number of variables and interactions, improving the possibility of applying it on quantum hardware by means of Quantum Annealing or the Quantum Approximated Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We also present two new types of problems, the Coloured Chess Piece Problem and the Max Chess Pieces Problem, with their corresponding QUBO formulations.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words completion of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>
