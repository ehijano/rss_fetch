      <title>Forsaking your own: unveiling the delayed recognition of Garfield's work on the "delayed recognition" phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delayed recognition (DR) implies that the full scholarly potential of certain scientific papers is recognized belatedly many years after their publication. Such papers are initially barely cited (sleep), and then suddenly, sometime in the future, their citation numbers burst (are awakened). After van Raan (2004a) called them "Sleeping Beauties" the DR phenomenon has drawn considerable attention. However, long before van Raan (2004a) Garfield studied the phenomenon in a series of articles from 1970 up to year 2004. In the present study we ask the pertinent question; Has the phenomenon of DR itself suffered the delayed recognition? In search of an answer we study the citation history of the Garfield (1980a) paper in which Garfield addressed DR directly for the first time. We find that the paper hardly received the attention befitting the Garfield's stature as an information scientist. Specifically, the paper received a meager of 10 citations up to the publication year of van Raan (2004a) and was then, in 2007, feebly awakened from its deep sleep of twenty-eight years receiving 20 citations in next four years; up to 2010. Being the undisputed giant of information science that even Garfield's paper on DR can suffer DR is hardly anticipated.</description>

      <title>Women in Theoretical Quantum Physics in Brazil:demographics, career profiles, recognition, and leadership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gender imbalance in Physics remains a persistent global challenge, and Brazil is no exception. While women account for only 24% of Physics faculty in the country, their representation in Quantum Physics is even smaller. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive overview of women working in Theoretical Quantum Physics in Brazil, here referred to as the SheQ (She + Quantum) community. Using data from the CNPq Lattes platform, we identify 93 researchers and analyze their geographic distribution, academic trajectories, scientific productivity, international experience, recognition through awards and fellowships, and engagement with initiatives promoting gender equity. Our results reveal both progress and persistent disparities: SheQ researchers have a strong scientific output, leadership roles, and international training; yet, their recognition through productivity fellowships remains modest, and their involvement in gender-related initiatives, although increasing among younger generations, remains limited. By combining quantitative indicators with institutional perspectives, we highlight structural barriers as well as opportunities for fostering a more inclusive environment in Quantum Physics. his study thus contributes to a broader reflection on how diversity not only promotes fairness but also strengthens creativity, innovation, and scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Identifying and understanding obstacles to heating sobriety and thermal comfort in collective housing: Insights from a survey in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many countries, central heating systems are widely used in multifamily housing allowing maintenance and costs to be shared. However, these systems often limit residents' control over their own consumption, complicating efforts to reduce energy use and maintain comfort. Despite the growing importance of household energy savings in national and European climate targets, little research has examined user experiences with these systems. This study addresses that gap through an exploratory survey conducted in France. Grounded in scientific literature, technical analyses, and current policy frameworks, the survey was distributed through various channels-including public institutions, online platforms, and field outreach-and collected 403 responses. It examined user difficulties in managing heating, including challenges with controls, bill comprehension, and communication with landlords. It also explored behaviours with high energy-savings impact: reducing heating at night or during absences, window opening, and shutter use. Findings show that many residents face barriers to energy-efficient heating, often due to difficult-to-use controls, limited feedback on consumption, and poor support from landlords or property managers. Those who do not reduce heating at night or when away frequently report these challenges. Participants expressed strong interest in solutions such as personalized advice, real-time feedback, and connected radiator valves to improve comfort, control, and energy management. This work highlights the need to better integrate user experience into multifamily housing energy policies. It provides actionable insights for policymakers and housing providers seeking to enhance comfort and energy savings while supporting France and Europe's broader energy transition goals.</description>

      <title>Fairness, Travel, and Market Potential: An Optimization Framework for NBA Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Basketball Association (NBA) is actively considering the addition of two expansion teams, raising the question of how to restructure its conferences and divisions to balance travel efficiency, fairness, and revenue opportunities. This study fills a gap at the intersection of sports operations and strategic league design by providing a quantitative framework for expansion planning. We develop two optimization models: one minimizing total travel distance and another using a Nash Bargaining framework to balance travel burdens while accounting for media market size. Using data from all 30 current franchises and six candidate cities (Seattle, Las Vegas, Montreal, Vancouver, Tampa, and Mexico City), we evaluate 15 pairwise expansion scenarios under alternative season lengths and divisional formats. Results show that while the distance-minimizing model produces geographically tight divisions, the Nash Bargaining model generates more balanced outcomes, particularly for geographically isolated franchises, with only modest efficiency losses. Our study offers a flexible decision support framework for league executives, policymakers, and sports economists. It provides evidence-based insights into how expansion decisions can balance operational efficiency, fairness in competition, and access to major media markets in a multi-billion-dollar sports league.</description>

      <title>Generating temporal networks with the Ascona model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new sampling method for continuous-time temporal networks based on queueing processes. In particular, we focus on a Markovian version of the model where the links between nodes are Poisson distributed in time and have exponential duration. We highlight the stochastic properties of these temporal structures and leverage them to design synthetic temporal networks with a controllable level of smoothness, which follow patterns relevant for the validation and interpretation of methods for community, scale, change-point, and periodicity detection. Additionally, we show that imposing assortativity constraints on the samples leads to a continuous-time generalization of stochastic block models. Finally, we describe how variations of the model can be used to sample alternative types of structure and temporal networks, especially discrete-time ones.</description>

      <title>Irrelevant carrots and non-existent sticks: trust, governance, and security in the transition to quantum-safe systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing poses an urgent and widely recognised threat to global cybersecurity, enabling encrypted government, financial, and healthcare data harvested today to be decrypted in the near future. Transitioning to quantum-safe cryptography is therefore essential, demanding coordinated action across a complex, multi-actor innovation system. Drawing on insights from an expert workshop in Amsterdam, this study develops a socially informed vision for a quantum-safe future and analyses the current innovation landscape to identify critical gaps and the actions needed to address them. We map twelve key actor groups involved in the migration process, finding that regulators exert the strongest direct influence, while standardisation bodies play a crucial indirect role. This research provides one of the first system-level mappings of actors, influence pathways and governance responsibilities shaping the quantum-safe transition, revealing several responsibilities with unclear ownership. Although centred on the Netherlands, our findings are applicable to other national contexts navigating quantum-safe transitions.</description>

      <title>The charm of independent voters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent voters play an increasingly decisive role in contemporary elections, yet their collective behavior remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how a minority of voters with greater flexibility in their political preferences influences opinion formation in polarized electorates. Using a modified Deffuant model, we show that even simple heterogeneity in agents' openness to vote switching can generate rich and unexpected collective outcomes: "open-minded" agents may (i) prevent full convergence into established party blocs, (ii) give rise to transient centrist clusters, or (iii) align with the positions of major parties. These dynamics resemble empirical patterns observed among real-world independent voters. Our results demonstrate that small shifts in openness parameters can substantially reshape the macroscopic structure of political competition, offering a simple explanation for oscillatory electoral outcomes and the emergence of unstable centrist or cross-cutting coalitions.</description>

      <title>A Path to Resource Optimization and Technological Innovation: Advancing Space and Climate Research with Bidirectional Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Bidirectional Technologies (BiTs), which is defined as technology that addresses the challenges within the aerospace and climate sectors simultaneously. BiTs presents a means to meet global development agendas, in particular, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Space2030 Agenda. These frameworks position aerospace innovations as tools to address climate change, explicitly highlighting the shared challenges between both fields. This overlap presents an underexplored opportunity to develop BiTs. To explore this potential, the study conducts an extensive literature review to examine the challenges within four categories in both Earth and space contexts: life support, energy systems, monitoring and exploratory systems, and novel technologies. Key traits that influence the successful development of BiTs are then extracted. Based on these traits, a set of actionable recommendations is proposed to serve as a starting point for policymakers and engineers to adapt technologies beyond single-domain applications. Ultimately, this study presents BiTs as a solution to the interconnected challenges on Earth and in space, offering strategies that advance innovation while contributing to global sustainability efforts.</description>

      <title>Who Connects Global Aid? The Hidden Geometry of 10 Million Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global aid system functions as a complex and evolving ecosystem; yet widespread understanding of its structure remains largely limited to aggregate volume flows. Here we map the network topology of global aid using a dataset of unprecedented scale: over 10 million transaction records connecting 2,456 publishing organisations across 230 countries between 1967 and 2025. We apply bipartite projection and dimensionality reduction to reveal the geometry of the system and unveil hidden patterns. This exposes distinct functional clusters that are otherwise sparsely connected. We find that while governments and multilateral agencies provide the primary resources, a small set of knowledge brokers provide the critical connectivity. Universities and research foundations specifically act as essential bridges between disparate islands of implementers and funders. We identify a core solar system of 25 central actors who drive this connectivity including unanticipated brokers like J-PAL and the Hewlett Foundation. These findings demonstrate that influence in the aid ecosystem flows through structural connectivity as much as financial volume. Our results provide a new framework for donors to identify strategic partners that accelerate coordination and evidence diffusion across the global network.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory for dialectology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is it possible to develop a `physics of language' which can explain the spatial, temporal and social patterns we see, and which can predict future change like we forecast the weather? Such a theory is likely to involve ideas from statistical physics. A substantial literature already applies these ideas to language. However, we lack a model which can match the spatial-temporal detail of historical changes at the level of individual linguistic features, and which offers a principled mechanism to predict the future. Here we present a statistical field theory for the evolution of linguistic variables which takes steps to fill this gap. Linguistic variant frequencies are represented as a stochastic state field with spatial interaction and social conformity, coupled to a latent bias field with Onsager Machlup action that reduces overfitting to data. We derive parameter inference procedures and demonstrate them using examples of large-scale dialect survey data from the twentieth century United States. The bias field has a characteristic half-life, which determines the horizon over which linguistic change can be predicted. Inferred model parameters provide evidence for surface-tension-driven coarsening of dialect regions, with population-density gradients exerting systematic forces on interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study opinion formation in a society where agents interact on a modular network generated using a stochastic block model (SBM). Opinion dynamics is modeled through the Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen (BChS) kinetic exchange model, in which agents undergo pairwise interactions that could be positive or negative. By tuning the relative strength of intra- and inter-group connectivity inherent to the SBM, as well as the disagreement probability, we identify distinct collective phases. In particular, we observe a robust regime with strong intragroup ordering but no global consensus, in addition to fully ordered and disordered states. These results demonstrate how modular interaction structure can qualitatively alter collective opinion dynamics and hinder consensus formation.</description>

      <title>Immigrant Residential Segregation in Europe: A Comparative Study of Spatial Segregation Patterns in Urban Areas across 30 Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immigrant residential segregation can profoundly shape access to opportunities, immigrant integration, and inter-group relations. Yet we lack systematic evidence on how segregation varies across Europe, and what structural factors are associated with these patterns. This study addresses the gap by focusing on two questions: (i) how does immigrant-native segregation vary across urban areas in Europe, and (ii) which urban area- and country-level characteristics are consistently linked to segregation? Using harmonised 1x1 km grid-level data from the 2021/22 census, we calculate spatially weighted Dissimilarity Indices for all 717 Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) across 30 European countries. We combine these measures with rich data on demographics, the economy, housing, immigrant populations, and policy. To identify robust correlates of segregation, we apply a Specification Curve Analysis across 16,164 regression models. Segregation is higher in Western and Northern Europe compared to most of Eastern and Southern Europe. Moreover, we show that segregation is heavily driven by macro-spatial dynamics between diverse urban cores and relatively homogeneous suburban areas. At the urban area level, segregation is systematically linked to the demographic composition and spatial distribution of the local population, economic conditions, housing market characteristics, as well as the composition of the immigrant population. At the national level, established immigrant destinations are more segregated, while migration and integration policies are not consistently linked to segregation. These findings offer the most comprehensive comparative assessment of immigrant segregation across Europe to date, revealing how structural conditions relate to spatial integration.</description>

      <title>A Brief History and Outlook of Hadronic Physics in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic physics has gradually emerged as one of the growing research frontiers in Indonesia, driven by efforts to better understand the properties of the strong interaction and the internal structure of hadrons from the fundamental principles of Quantum Chromodynamics. In the last few decades, Indonesian researchers have made significant contributions to developing various theoretical and phenomenological aspects of hadrons. In addition, on the experimental side, Indonesian scientists have participated in hadron experiment facilities overseas, such as the ALICE collaboration at CERN, which has strengthened the scientific activities and networks and has supported the training of young Indonesian researchers. In the present paper, we review Indonesian scientists' contributions to hadronic physics, highlight ongoing research directions in both experimental and theoretical, and outline strategies for future development toward integration into the international hadronic physics community.</description>

      <title>Networks as the fundamental constituents of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review an approach that uses binary relations as the fundamental constituents of the universe, utilizing them as building blocks for both space and matter. The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: Many modern areas have not learned their lessons and often hope for the wisdom of later generations, resulting in them only possessing modern technology and difficult to iterate ancient civilizations. At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by population mean and standard deviation. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</description>

      <title>Long-term impact of PM2.5 on mortality is exacerbated when wildfire events occur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is extensive evidence that long-term exposure to all-source PM2.5 increases mortality. However, to date, no study has evaluated whether this effect is exacerbated in the presence of wildfire events. Here, we study 60+ million older US adults and find that wildfire events increase the harmful effects of long-term all-source PM2.5 exposure on mortality, providing a new and realistic conceptualization of wildfire health risks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Nuclear Microreactor Cost-competitiveness in Current Electricity Markets Considering Reactor Cost Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the cost competitiveness of microreactors in today's electricity markets, with a focus on uncertainties in reactor costs. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize key technical parameters, such as reactor capacity, fuel enrichment, tail enrichment, refueling interval, and discharge burnup, to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Base case results are validated using Simulated Annealing (SA). By incorporating Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) for fuel cycle costs, the study identifies optimal configurations under uncertainty. Methodologically, it introduces a novel framework combining probabilistic cost modeling with evolutionary optimization. Results show that microreactors can remain cost-competitive, with LCOEs ranging from \$48.21/MWh to \$78.32/MWh when supported by the Production Tax Credit (PTC). High reactor capacity, low fuel enrichment, moderate tail enrichment and refueling intervals, and high discharge burnup enhance cost efficiency. Among all factors, overnight capital cost (OCC) has the most significant impact on LCOE, while O&amp;M and fuel cost uncertainties have lesser effects. The analysis highlights how energy policies like the PTC can reduce LCOE by 22-24%, improving viability despite cost variability. Compared to conventional nuclear, coal, and renewable sources like offshore wind, hydro, and biomass, optimized microreactors show strong economic potential. This research defines a realistic design space and key trade-offs, offering actionable insights for policymakers, reactor designers, and energy planners aiming to accelerate the deployment of affordable, sustainable microreactors.</description>
