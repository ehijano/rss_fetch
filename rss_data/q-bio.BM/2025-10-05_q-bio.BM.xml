      <title>FLOWR.root: A flow matching based foundation model for joint multi-purpose structure-aware 3D ligand generation and affinity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Flowr.root, an equivariant flow-matching model for pocket-aware 3D ligand generation with joint binding affinity prediction and confidence estimation. The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50, pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific adaptation. Flowr.root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, Flowr.root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2alpha ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ERalpha and TYK2 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling, Flowr.root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design spanning hit identification through lead optimization.</description>

      <title>SAE-RNA: A Sparse Autoencoder Model for Interpreting RNA Language Model Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning, particularly with the advancement of Large Language Models, has transformed biomolecular modeling, with protein advances (e.g., ESM) inspiring emerging RNA language models such as RiNALMo. Yet how and what these RNA Language Models internally encode about messenger RNA (mRNA) or non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families remains unclear. We present SAE- RNA, interpretability model that analyzes RiNALMo representations and maps them to known human-level biological features. Our work frames RNA interpretability as concept discovery in pretrained embeddings, without end-to-end retraining, and provides practical tools to probe what RNA LMs may encode about ncRNA families. The model can be extended to close comparisons between RNA groups, and supporting hypothesis generation about previously unrecognized relationships.</description>

      <title>On diffusion posterior sampling via sequential Monte Carlo for zero-shot scaffolding of protein motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, new proteins can be generated at an unprecedented rate. The motif scaffolding problem requires steering this generative process to yield proteins with a desirable functional substructure called a motif. While models have been trained to take the motif as conditional input, recent techniques in diffusion posterior sampling can be leveraged as zero-shot alternatives whose approximations can be corrected with sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. In this work, we introduce a new set of guidance potentials for describing scaffolding tasks and solve them by adapting SMC-aided diffusion posterior samplers with an unconditional model, Genie, as a prior. In single motif problems, we find that (i) the proposed potentials perform comparably, if not better, than the conventional masking approach, (ii) samplers based on reconstruction guidance outperform their replacement method counterparts, and (iii) measurement tilted proposals and twisted targets improve performance substantially. Furthermore, as a demonstration, we provide solutions to two multi-motif problems by pairing reconstruction guidance with an SE(3)-invariant potential. We also produce designable internally symmetric monomers with a guidance potential for point symmetry constraints. Our code is available at: https://github.com/matsagad/mres-project.</description>

      <title>AReUReDi: Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows with Multi-Objective Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.</description>
