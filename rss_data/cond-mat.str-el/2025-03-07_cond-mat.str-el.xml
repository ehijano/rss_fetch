      <title>Enhanced superconducting correlations in the Emery model and its connections to strange metallic transport and normal state coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped two-dimensional three-band Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear transport behavior, the three-band model shows a low temperature resistivity curvature indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. Evidence has also been found in thermodynamic and superconducting measurements, which suggests that some degree of coherence in transport might be necessary for the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, further implying a possible connection between superconducting and transport behaviors.</description>

      <title>Resistive Anomaly near a Ferromagnetic Phase Transition: A Classical Memory Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate resistive anomalies in metals near ferromagnetic phase transitions, focusing on the role of long-range critical fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that diffusive motion of electrons near the critical temperature ($T_c$) enhances a singular behavior of the resistivity near $T_c$ through a classical memory effect, surpassing the prediction by Fisher and Langer \cite{Fisher:1968}. We show that, close enough to $T_c$, the resistivity exhibits a cusp or anticusp, whose profile is controlled by the critical exponent of the order parameter. We also parameterize the non-Drude behavior of the optical conductivity due to a classical memory effect in terms of critical exponents. These findings offer a deeper understanding of resistive anomalies and their connection to critical exponents in metallic systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral currents at zero magnetic field in some two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal critical currents without applying an external magnetic field have been observed recently in several superconductors, in various forms of Graphene, a Kagome compound and in an under-doped cuprate. A necessary requirement for this is that the usual supercurrent be accompanied by a chiral super-current, i.e. with the symmetry of a hall current; equivalently that the superfluid density tensor have a chiral component. It also requires inversion breaking. The conditions for this phenomena are derived to find that their normal states must break time-reversal and chirality and that the superconducting states must in addition be non-unitary. Each of the superconductors where spontaneous non-reciprocal critical currents are observed have shown some evidence for such broken symmetries in the normal state. The superconducting state of such materials have topological edge currents, but their projected electro-magnetic part is in general not an integer. The edge states are protected in the superconductor due to a gap. Under ideal conditions, the normal state should show an anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Square lattice model with staggered magnetic fluxes: zero Chern number topological states and topological flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Staggered magnetic fluxes (SMF) play a crucial role in achieving Chern insulators (CIs), by which a series of CI models have been established on various lattices. In addition, SMF induced higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) in a lattice model has been reported. In this work, we propose a square lattice model with SMF. We find intracellular SMF can induce zero-Chern-number topological insulator (ZCNTI) at quarter filling which hosts topologically protected edge states characterized by the quantized polarization, in analogy to the topological state in two dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model. When lattice dimerization and intracellular SMF are introduced, there exists HOTI state at half filling. Furthermore, this model hosts topological flat band (TFB) by considering the next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. Several fractional Chern insulator states are investigated when hard-core bosons are filled into this TFB model.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Multifractality and Anomalous Hall Response in the Nodal Line Semimetal Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ Near Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological states of matter exhibit unique protection against scattering by disorder. Different topological classes exhibit distinct forms and degrees of protection. Here, we investigate the response of the ferromagnetic nodal line semimetal Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ to disorder and electronic interactions. By combining global magneto-transport with atomic-scale scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find a simultaneous onset of diverse phenomena below a common temperature scale of about 15 K: A crossover from metallic to insulating temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity, saturation of the anomalous Hall conductivity to its maximal value, formation of a sharp zero-bias dip in the tunneling density of state, and emergence of multi-fractal structure of the electronic wavefunction peaking at the Fermi energy. These concurrent observations reflect the emergence of a novel energy scale possibly related to the opening of a gap in the nodal line band of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Our study provides overarching insight into the role of disorder, electronic interactions and Berry curvature in setting the micro- and macro-scale responses of topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Detection of 2D SPT Order with Partial Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method of using partial symmetries to distinguish two dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of on-site, unitary symmetries is proposed. This novel order parameter takes a wavefunction, such as a ground state of a lattice model, and detects its SPT invariants as expectation values of finitely supported operators, without the need for flux insertion. The construction exploits the rotational symmetry of the lattice to extract on-site SPT invariants, building upon prior work on probing crystalline SPT phases with partial rotations. The method is demonstrated by computing the order parameter analytically on group cohomology models and numerically on a family of states interpolating between the CZX state and a trivial state. Its robustness is suggested by interpreting partial symmetries as generating the topological partition functions of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin liquid ground state in a rare-earth triangular antiferromagnet SmTa$_7$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare-earth-based geometrically frustrated triangular magnets have attracted considerable attention due to the intricate interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling and the crystal electric field (CEF), which often leads to effective spin-1/2 degrees of freedom and therefore promotes strong quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, thus offering an excellent route to stabilize a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state. We have investigated the ground state magnetic properties of a polycrystalline sample of $\text{SmTa}_7\text{O}_{19}$ which we propose to have a gapless QSL ground state by employing powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), DC and AC-magnetic susceptibility, $M$ vs. $H$ isotherm, specific heat, and muon spin rotation/relaxation measurements ($\mu$SR) down to 30 mK. The combined structural and electronic studies reveal the formation of an edge-sharing equilateral triangular lattice of Sm$^{3+}$ ions in $ab$ plane. The DC, AC magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements reveal that $\text{SmTa}_7\text{O}_{19}$ does not exhibit any long-range magnetic ordering transition down to 50 mK. The zero-field (ZF)-$\mu$SR study strongly refutes the long-range magnetically ordered ground state and/or any partial spin-freezing down to at least 30 mK. The ZF-muon-spin relaxation rate is weakly temperature dependent between 50 and 20 K, rapidly increases below $\sim$20 K and saturates at low temperatures between 2 K and 30 mK, which has been attributed to a characteristic signature of QSL systems. Further, our longitudinal-field (LF)-$\mu$SR measurements at 0.1 K reveal a dynamic nature of the magnetic ground state. In addition, our high-field specific heat data suggest a gapless nature of spin excitations in this compound.</description>

      <title>Spin-strain interactions under hydrostatic pressure in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressure on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a prototypical material for the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice with a possible spin-liquid ground state. Using ultrasound measurements at pressures up to 1.16 GPa, we reveal significant modifications of the acoustic properties and the $H$-$T$ phase diagram of this material. Hydrostatic pressure suppresses the three-dimensional magnetic order and induces a dimerization transition at higher pressures. At low pressures, the sound attenuation exhibits a linear temperature dependence, while above 0.28 GPa, it becomes nearly temperature independent, suggesting a shift in the phonon scattering regime dominated by Majorana fermions. These findings provide new insights into spin-strain interactions in Kitaev magnets and deliver a detailed characterization of the $H$-$T$ phase diagram of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under hydrostatic pressure.</description>

      <title>Quench of the electronic order in a strongly-coupled charge-density-wave system by enhanced lattice fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-density-wave (CDW) materials having a strong electron-phonon coupling provide a powerful platform for investigating the intricate interplay between lattice fluctuations and a macroscopic quantum order. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES), we reveal that the CDW gap closure in VTe2 is dominated by an incoherent process evolving on a sub-picosecond timescale, challenging the conventional view that the gap dynamics is primarily governed by the excitation of the CDW amplitude modes. Our findings, supported by a three-temperature model, show that the CDW gap evolution can be described by considering the population of a subset of strongly-coupled optical phonon modes, which leads to an increase in the lattice fluctuations. This microscopic framework extends beyond VTe2, offering a universal perspective for understanding the light-induced phase transition in strongly-coupled CDW systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Thickness Dependence of the Vortex Pearl Length in Few-Layer NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of multiple types of orders is a common thread in condensed matter physics and unconventional superconductors. The nature of superconducting orders may be unveiled by analyzing local perturbations such as vortices. For thin films, the vortex magnetic profile is characterized by the Pearl-length {\Lambda}, which is inversely proportional to the 2D superfluid density; hence, normally, also inversely proportional to the film thickness, d. Here we employ the scanning SQUID-on-tip microscopy to measure {\Lambda} in NbSe2 flakes with thicknesses ranging from N=3 to 53 layers. For N&gt;10, we find the expected dependence {\Lambda}{\varpropto}1/d. However, six-layer films show a sharp increase of {\Lambda} deviating by a factor of three from the expected value. This value remains fixed for N=3 to 6. This unexpected behavior suggests the competition between two orders; one residing only on the first and last layers of the film while the other prevails in all layers.</description>

      <title>Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\"obner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360,12,24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the \emph{large-scale structure of entanglement} of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Intervalley-Coupled Twisted Bilayer Graphene from Substrate Commensuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that intervalley coupling can be induced in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by aligning the bottom graphene layer with either of two types of commensurate insulating triangular Bravais lattice substrate. The intervalley coupling folds the $\pm K$ valleys of TBG to $\Gamma$-point and hybridizes the original TBG flat bands into a four-band model equivalent to the $p_x$-$p_y$ orbital honeycomb lattice model, in which the second conduction and valence bands have quadratic band touchings and can become flat due to geometric frustration. The spin-orbit coupling from the substrate opens gaps between the bands, yielding topological bands with spin Chern numbers $\mathcal{C}$ up to $\pm 4$. For realistic substrate potential strengths, the minimal bandwidths of the hybridized flat bands are still achieved around the TBG magic angle $\theta_M=1.05^\circ$, and their quantum metrics are nearly ideal. We identify two candidate substrate materials Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and GeSb$_2$Te$_4$, which nearly perfectly realize the commensurate lattice constant ratio of $\sqrt{3}$ with graphene. These systems provide a promising platform for exploring strongly correlated topological states driven by geometric frustration.</description>

      <title>Spectral signature of periodic modulation and sliding of pseudogap state in moire system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the pseudogap state is widely believed as a key to understanding the pairing mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity. Over the past two decades, significant efforts have been devoted to searching for spontaneous symmetry breaking or potential order parameters associated with these pseudogap states, aiming to better characterize their properties. Recently, pseudogap states have also been realized in moire systems with extensive gate tunability, yet their local electronic structure remains largely unexplored8. In this study, we report the observation of gate-tunable spontaneous symmetry breaking and sliding behavior of the pseudogap state in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MAtBG) using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. Our spectroscopy reveals a distinct pseudogap at 4.4 K within the doping range -3 &lt; v &lt; -2. Spectroscopic imaging highlights a gap size modulation at moire scale that is sensitive to the filling, indicative of a wave-like fluctuating pseudogap feature. Specifically, the positions of gap size minima (GSM) coincide with regions of the highest local density of states (LDOS) at the filling v = -2.63, but a unidirectional sliding behavior of GSM is observed for other fillings. In addition, the pseudogap size distribution at certain doping levels also causes a clear nematic order, or an anisotropic gap distribution. Our results have shed light on the complex nature of this pseudogap state, revealing critical insights into the phase diagram of correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in Dirac semimetal probed by in-plane magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) formulated by geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions is a ubiquitous transport phenomenon not limited to magnetic systems but also allowed in non-magnetic ones under an external field breaking time-reversal symmetry. On the other hand, detection of field-induced AHE is practically challenging because the band modulation through the Zeeman and spin-orbit couplings is typically small compared to other contributions as induced by the Lorentz force. Here, we demonstrate on Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ films that the field-induced AHE in non-magnetic systems can be quantitatively probed by applying and rotating the magnetic field within the Hall deflection plane. Measurements on the Cd$_3$As$_2$ (112) plane reveal that AHE emerges as a clear three-fold symmetric component for the in-plane field rotation. This intrinsic response becomes more pronounced in ultralow-electron-density films where significant variations in the geometric properties are expected under the magnetic field. Our findings open new opportunities in the research of Hall responses manifested as orbital magnetization in non-magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of collective charge excitations in a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent symmetry breakings in condensed matter systems are often intimately linked to collective excitations. For example, the intertwined spin-charge stripe order in cuprate superconductors is associated with spin and charge excitations. While the collective behavior of spin excitations is well established, the nature of charge excitations remains to be understood. Here we present a high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge excitations in the stripe-ordered cuprate La$_{1.675}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$. The RIXS spectra consist of both charge and phonon excitations around the charge ordering wave vector. By modeling the momentum-dependent phonon intensity, the charge-excitation spectral weight is extracted for a wide range of energy. As such, we reveal the highly dispersive nature of the charge excitations, with an energy scale comparable to the spin excitations. Since charge order and superconductivity in cuprates are possibly driven by the same electronic correlations, determining the interaction strength underlying charge order is essential to establishing a comprehensive microscopic model of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Identical Suppression of Spin and Charge Density Wave Transitions in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ by Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in nickelate systems is a key focus of condensed matter research. Microscopic insights into magnetism, which emerges near superconductivity, require a synergistic approach that combines complementary techniques with controlled parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), resistivity, and specific heat measurements. At ambient pressure, two incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) transitions were identified at $T_{\rm SDW} \simeq 132$ K and $T^\ast \simeq 90$ K. NPD experiments revealed that the magnetic wave vector $(0, 0.574, 0)$ remains unchanged below 130 K, indicating that the transition at $T^\ast$ corresponds to a reorientation of the Ni magnetic moments within a similar magnetic structure. Comparison of the observed internal magnetic fields with dipole-field calculations reveals a magnetic structure consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled SDW on the outer two Ni layers, with smaller moments on the inner Ni layer. The internal fields at muon stopping sites appeared abruptly at $T_{\rm SDW}$, suggesting a first-order-like nature of the SDW transition, which is closely linked to the charge density wave (CDW) order occurring at the same temperature ($T_{\rm SDW} = T_{\rm CDW}$). Under applied pressure, all transition temperatures, including $T_{\rm SDW}$, $T^\ast$, and $T_{\rm CDW}$, were suppressed at a nearly uniform rate of $\simeq -13$ K/GPa. This behavior contrasts with the double-layer RP nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where pressure enhances the separation of the density wave transitions.</description>

      <title>Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes present a promising route to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet systematic strategies for their exploration remain underdeveloped. In this work, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. Besides providing efficient characterizations for demonstrations using Gr\"obner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem, allowing us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choice of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their inherent link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and offer an efficient method for searching for finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced mathematical structures.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory unifying the topological responses and anomalies of various gapless fermion systems exhibiting Fermi surfaces, including those with Berry phases, and nodal structures, which applies beyond non-interacting limit. As our key finding, we obtain a general approach to directly relate gapless fermions and topological insulators in phase space, including first- and higher-order insulators. Using this relation we show that the low-energy properties and response theories for gapless fermionic systems can be directly obtained without resorting to microscopic details. Our results provide a unified framework for describing such systems using well-developed theories from the study of topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Distinct charge and spin recovery dynamics in a photo-excited Mott insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pump-probe response of the spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ reveals a rapid creation of low energy optical weight and suppression of three dimensional magnetic order on laser pumping. Post pump there is a quick reduction of the optical weight but a very slow recovery of the magnetic order - the difference is attributed to weak inter-layer exchange in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ delaying the recovery of three dimensional magnetic order. We demonstrate that the effect has a very different and more fundamental origin. Combining spatio-temporal mean field dynamics and Langevin dynamics on the photoexcited Mott-Hubbard insulator we show that the timescale difference is not a dimensional effect but is intrinsic to charge dynamics versus order reconstruction in a correlated system. In two dimensions itself we obtain a short, almost pump fluence independent, timescale for charge dynamics while recovery time of magnetic order involves domain growth and increases rapidly with fluence. Apart from resolving the iridate Mott problem our approach can be used to analyse phase competition and spatial ordering in superconductors and charge ordered systems out of equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  The limit $q\to1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. At finite size, only the latter is U(1)-symmetric.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry (HS) chains, as well as the Inozemtsev chain and its recent q-deformation. We find that the two landscapes only share a single point: the rational HS chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the anti-periodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced strong zero modes in short quantum dot chains with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the emergence of strong zero modes in a two-site chain consisting of two quantum dots coupled due to a central dot that mediates electron hopping and singlet superconducting pairing. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the on-site Coulomb interaction leads to a three-fold ground-state degeneracy when tuning the system to a sweet spot as a function of the inter-dot couplings. This degeneracy is protected against changes of the dot energies in the same way as "poor man's'' Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains. In the limit of strong interactions, this protection is maximal and the entire spectrum becomes triply degenerate, indicating the emergence of a ''poor man's'' version of a strong zero mode. We explain the degeneracy and protection by constructing corresponding Majorana Kramers-pair operators and $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermion operators. The strong zero modes share many properties of Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains, including the stability of zero-bias peaks in the conductance and the behavior upon coupling to an additional quantum dot. However, they can be distinguished through finite-bias spectroscopy and the exhibit a different behavior when scaling to longer chains.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.</description>
