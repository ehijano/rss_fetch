      <title>A Tribute to Alexander Andrianov: A Life for Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alexander Andreevich Andrianov was a remarkable personality in Russian physics during the last decades. A member of th prestigious school of theoretical physics in Saint Petersburg, he made relevant contributions to a number of topics along his life. His activity ran in parallel with profound changes in his home country and the international arena. He was very much involved in this series of conferences, being the host of the 2014 edition in Saint Petersburg. In this presentation made at the XVI Conference on Quark Confinement and Hadron Spectrum I will provide a vision -- necessarily personal -- of his life and his activities and how these influenced many of us.</description>

      <title>Physical, Empirical, and Conditional Inductive Possibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I argue that John Norton's notions of empirical, hypothetical, and counterfactual possibility can be successfully used to analyze counterintuitive examples of physical possibility and align better with modal intuitions of practicing physicists. First, I clarify the relationship between Norton's possibility notions and the received view of logical and physical possibility. In particular, I argue that Norton's empirical, hypothetical, and counterfactual possibility cannot coincide with the received view of physical possibility; instead, the received view of physical possibility is a special case of Norton's logical possibility. I illustrate my claims using examples from Classical Mechanics, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics. I then arrive at my conclusions by subsuming Norton's empirical, hypothetical, and counterfactual possibilities under a single concept of conditional inductive possibility and by analyzing the types and degrees of strengths that can be associated with it.</description>

      <title>What is so special about analogue simulations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper defends an account of terrestrial analogue simulations in black hole physics as instances of inferences from material analogy in science (Hesse 1963). We outline the main verdicts and recommendations deriving from this analysis, arguing that they not only fit the existing practice but are also more credible than those supported by prominent epistemological alternatives (e.g., Crowther et al. 2019, Dardashti et al. 2019).</description>
