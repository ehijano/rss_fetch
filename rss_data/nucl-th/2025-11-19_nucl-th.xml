      <title>Formulation of fully covariant Quantum-Molecular Dynamics for an N-body system with scalar and vector potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully covariant transport framework for Molecular Dynamics that enables a consistent description of the evolution of relativistic N-body systems. For the first time, we derive relativistic equations of motion incorporating both scalar and vector interactions within a manifestly covariant formulation. This approach addresses several fundamental issues in relativistic many-body dynamics: the implications of different choices of time-constraints, the emergence of the non-relativistic limit, the frame independence of the system's evolution, and the distinct dynamical roles of scalar and vector potentials. These aspects are investigated in detail for the scattering of two- and four-body systems, offering new insights into the consistency and physical interpretation of relativistic interactions in a covariant setting.</description>

      <title>Cluster phenomena using few-body and Lattice QCD theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of first-principles calculations for baryon-baryon interactions, it becomes possible to obtain reliable hyperon-nucleon potentials by lattice QCD simulations with the HAL QCD method. High-precision few-body methods, such as the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM), are applicable to solve quantum few-body systems up to four- and five-body systems. By combining the HAL QCD potentials with the GEM, one can predict the level structure of novel hypernuclei prior to experimental observation. In this review, we utilize the lattice QCD $N\Xi$ potential obtained by the HAL QCD method to investigate the few-body systems $NN\Xi$ and $NNN\Xi$. Our analysis indicates that the lightest bound $\Xi$ hypernucleus is the $NNN\Xi$ system. To extract detailed information on the isospin and spin components of the $N\Xi$ interaction, we perform a four-body calculation for the $\alpha\alpha N\Xi$ system with the total isospin $T = 0$ and $T = 1$. We demonstrate that the level structure of this system is sensitive to the isospin and spin dependencies of the $N\Xi$ interaction. Furthermore, we propose experimental investigations to produce the $NNN\Xi$ and $\alpha\alpha N\Xi$ systems via the $(K^-, K^+)$ and $(K^-, K^0)$ reactions on $^4$He and $^{10}$B targets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation due to threshold states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have completed the A=16 isospin quintets for states with spin/parity J{\pi} =0+ and 2+. The dependence of their masses as a function of isospin projection shows evidence for deviations from quadratic behavior indicating isospin violation beyond the expectation from two- body forces. The deviation is most pronounced for the 2+ states. Predictions from the Shell Model Embedded in the Continuum (SMEC) allow us to explain that this isospin violation is associated with a modification of the nuclear structure due to the open-quantum-system nature of the proton- rich members of the quintet. In particular, the 0+ and 2+ states in 16Ne and the 2+ state in 16F are threshold resonances located just above a proton-decay threshold where s-wave coupling to the continuum is expected. The measured deviations of these threshold states from the quadratic behavior of the remaining members of the multiplets makes it possible to obtain information on the magnitude and the energy dependence of the continuum-coupling energy correction. Continuum coupling is also indicated for the ground state of 8C, but this time through p-wave coupling.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study on the $\alpha$-particle preformation factor in the theory of $\alpha$-decay based on the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid approach combining the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) with the Coulomb and Proximity Potential Model (CPPM) is developed to investigate $\alpha$-particle preformation factors $P_{\alpha}$ and their impact on $\alpha$-decay half-lives. The TabPFN model, trained on 498 nuclei, accurately learns the relationship between the properties of the nuclear structure and $P_{\alpha}$, achieving a root mean square deviation of $\sigma_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.211$. The predicted factors reveal clear odd-even staggering and shell closure effects, and exhibit a linear correlation with $Q_{\alpha}^{-1/2}$, extending the Geiger-Nuttall systematics. When incorporated into CPPM calculations, the machine learning-based $P_{\alpha}$ values significantly improve half-life predictions. The capability of the model is demonstrated through predictions for superheavy nuclei ($Z = 117$--120), suggesting $N = 184$ as a potential neutron magic number.</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $-\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $J/\psi$ productions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02, 7, and 13 TeV with the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive $J/\psi$ productions in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$, 7, and 13 TeV using the PACIAE 4.0 model. This model extends PYTHIA 8.3 by incorporating partonic and hadronic rescatterings before and after hadronization, respectively. Several $J/\psi$ production mechanisms are considered: the leading-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) color-singlet and color-octet contributions, the cluster collapse mechanism, and the non-prompt $J/\psi$ from $b$-hadron decays. The simulated inclusive $J/\psi$ transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) differential cross sections agree well with the experimental data at both the middle and forward rapidities. For the $J/\psi$ yield, the dominant contribution comes from the NRQCD channel, while the cluster collapse and non-prompt processes provide relatively minor contributions. A decomposition of the NRQCD component, comprising direct production from the parton hard scattering and feed-down from $\psi(2S)$, $\chi_{c0}$, $\chi_{c1}$, and $\chi_{c2}$, reveals that at low (high) $p_{\rm T}$ the dominant contributions come from the direct production and $\chi_{c2}$ ($\chi_{c1}$) feed-down. The $\psi(2S)$ feed-down fraction is 8-9$\%$, while the $\chi_{c0}$ contribution is around 2-3$\%$. The influence of the partonic and hadronic rescatterings is also examined. The partonic rescattering exhibits negligible impact on the $J/\psi$ yields across all production mechanisms. In contrast, the hadronic rescattering suppresses the $J/\psi$ productions from both the NRQCD and cluster collapse mechanisms, while leaving the non-prompt $J/\psi$ yield almost unaffected.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field in frame of three-flavor Polyakov-extended Nambu-Jona-Lasino model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons $K_0, \pi_0, \eta, \eta'$ at finite temperature and magnetic field are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model. We focus on the effect of gluons, which is simulated by the Polyakov potential and the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect, which is mimicked by using a magnetic field dependent coupling constant. Mass spectra show similar structure when introducing the contribution of Polyakov potential and IMC effect. The mass of $K_0$ meson $m_{K_0}$ is controlled by chiral symmetry breaking and restoration. It increases with temperature in the low temperature region, and shows a mass jump at the Mott transition. Further increasing temperature, $m_{K_0}$ firstly decreases and then increases with temperature. $\pi_0$ meson is not only the pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, but also influenced by the flavor mixing of $\pi_0-\eta-\eta'$. The behavior of $m_{\pi_0}$ is different from $m_{K_0}$ only at high temperature region, which decreases with temperature. For $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons, they are affected by both the $U_A(1)$ anomaly and the flavor mixing of $\pi_0-\eta-\eta'$. The mass of $\eta$ meson $m_{\eta}$ decreases with temperature in low temperature region and then shows a jump at its Mott transition. After that $m_{\eta}$ firstly decreases and later increases with temperature. $\eta'$ mesons is a resonant state in vacuum and in medium, and its mass $m_{\eta'}$ continuously decreases and then increases with temperature. The mass jumps of $K_0, \pi_0, \eta$ mesons are caused by the dimension reduction of the constituent quarks under external magnetic field. In the PNJL model, the Mott transition temperature of $K_0,\ \pi_0$ mesons ($ \eta$ meson) decrease (increases) with magnetic field. The IMC effect leads to the lower value for meson Mott transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We feature out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and tripling phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. As for the in-vacuum case, the three-body clustering is always the lowest-lying phase. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper tripling phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.</description>

      <title>Plasma oscillations within Israel-Stewart theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that, at zero wavenumber, the non-hydrodynamic frequencies of uncharged kinetic theory are purely imaginary. On the other hand, it was recently shown that, in resistive magnetohydrodynamics, the interplay between the Israel-Stewart relaxation equation and the Amp\`{e}re-Maxwell law can give rise to a pair of oscillating non-hydrodynamic modes. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in detail. We first demonstrate that these oscillatory modes are exact solutions of the Drude model, corresponding to ordinary plasma oscillations. We then invoke the Onsager-Casimir principle to explain that their oscillatory nature reflects the distinct PT-transformation properties of the degrees of freedom: the distribution function is even, while the electric field is odd. Finally, we establish that, in a kinetic theory of charged particles, there can be at most one such pair of oscillatory modes per spatial dimension, while all other modes still must sit on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Probing Saturon-like Limits in QCD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-occupancy QCD matter enters a saturated regime when its entropy or occupancy approaches the unitarity bound $\sim 1/\alpha$, the ``saturon" criterion. We test this criterion for protons and nuclei at small $x$ using analytic and numerical solutions of the BK equation. From these solutions we construct the gluon occupancy $N_g(x)$ and a thermodynamic entropy $S(x)$ via an Unruh-like temperature $T = Q_s/(2\pi)$ and an emergent gluon mass $M_g \sim Q_s$. For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/\alpha_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/\alpha_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spontaneous induction of magnetic and electric fields in dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will demonstrate that a dense quark-matter system in the dual chiral density wave (DCDW) phase behaves as a ferromagnet in the sense that its magnetic-field dependent magnetization remains different from zero even at $B\rightarrow 0$. The corresponding permanent magnetization is a function of the baryonic chemical potential $\mu$, decreasing up to zero as $\mu$ increases in the range of intermediate densities ($312$ MeV $\leqslant \mu \leqslant 342$ MeV) and then increasing from zero in the higher density interval $490$ MeV$\leqslant \mu \leqslant 550$ MeV. We will show that this system's ability to generate permanent magnetization, together with the existence of the axial anomaly, open up the possibility of spontaneously generating a magnetic field coupled to a collinear electric field. The generated magnetic field can reach values up to $10^{16}$ G, depending on $\mu$, and the electric field will be 3 orders smaller. The fact that the DCDW phase is able to induce a magnetic field can be seen as its spontaneous tendency to remove the so called Landau-Peierls instability that is present in this single-modulated phase in the absence of a magnetic field. The spontaneous induction of a strong magnetic field at intermediate to high densities can be of interest for the astrophysics of compact stellar objects exhibiting strong magnetic fields as magnetars.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation with Resolution Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time comparable to the inverse of the energy gap in the physical spectrum.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay in the interacting boson model based on the nuclear energy density functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) are calculated in the interacting boson model (IBM), which is based on the nuclear energy density functional (EDF) theory. The Hamiltonian of the IBM that gives rise to the energies and wave functions of the ground and excited states of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay emitting isotopes and corresponding final nuclei is determined by mapping the self-consistent mean-field deformation-energy surface obtained with a given EDF onto the corresponding bosonic energy surface. The transition operators are formulated using the generalized seniority scheme, and the pair structure constants are determined by the inputs provided by the self-consistent calculations. The predicted values of the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay NMEs with the nonrelativistic and relativistic EDFs are compared with those resulting from different many-body methods. Sensitivities of the predicted NMEs to the model parameters and assumptions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Production of spectator neutrons, protons and light fragments on fixed targets at NICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model was connected to a set of models called Ablation Monte Carlo (AMC) to identify excited spectator fragments on completion of the UrQMD modeling of nucleus-nucleus collisions and then simulate spectator decays. The UrQMD-AMC approach combines the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) clustering algorithm, which associates individual nucleons with excited clusters termed prefragments, with decay models of excited nuclei from the Geant4 toolkit. The relevant decay model for the prefragments decay is selected based on their mass and excitation energy, and includes nuclear evaporation, statistical multifragmentation, and Fermi breakup models. The UrQMD-AMC approach was validated by comparing its results with data on the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of neutrons and light fragments from 600A MeV Sn + Sn and 10.6A GeV Au + Ag collisions. This approach supplements the evolution of individual nucleons during a nucleus-nucleus collision simulated with UrQMD with nucleon clustering to simulate also the production of spectator nuclear fragments, which are not produced in the UrQMD model alone.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-real supervised domain adaptation for radioisotope identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to improve the speed and reliability of radioisotope identification using gamma spectroscopy. However, meticulously labeling an experimental dataset for training is often prohibitively expensive, while training models purely on synthetic data is risky due to the domain gap between simulated and experimental measurements. In this research, we demonstrate that supervised domain adaptation can substantially improve the performance of radioisotope identification models by transferring knowledge between synthetic and experimental data domains. We consider two domain adaptation scenarios: (1) a simulation-to-simulation adaptation, where we perform multi-label proportion estimation using simulated high-purity germanium detectors, and (2) a simulation-to-experimental adaptation, where we perform multi-class, single-label classification using measured spectra from handheld lanthanum bromide (LaBr) and sodium iodide (NaI) detectors. We begin by pretraining a spectral classifier on synthetic data using a custom transformer-based neural network. After subsequent fine-tuning on just 64 labeled experimental spectra, we achieve a test accuracy of 96% in the sim-to-real scenario with a LaBr detector, far surpassing a synthetic-only baseline model (75%) and a model trained from scratch (80%) on the same 64 spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain-adapted models learn more human-interpretable features than experiment-only baseline models. Overall, our results highlight the potential for supervised domain adaptation techniques to bridge the sim-to-real gap in radioisotope identification, enabling the development of accurate and explainable classifiers even in real-world scenarios where access to experimental data is limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear modification and the universality of short-range correlation (SRC) in pion-induced Drell-Yan process. Employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and pion PDFs, the ratio of differential cross sections of different nuclei relative to the free nucleon is presented. A kind of universal modification function was proposed which would provide nontrivial tests of SRC universality on the platform of pion-induced Drell-Yan. This work improves our understanding of nuclear structure and strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of triaxiality in the charge radii of neutron-rich Ruthenium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first measurements with a new collinear laser spectroscopy setup at the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System utilizing its unique capability to deliver neutron-rich refractory metal isotopes produced by the spontaneous fission of 252Cf. We measured isotope shifts from optical spectra for nine radioactive ruthenium isotopes 106-114Ru, reaching deep into the mid-shell region. The extracted charge radii are in excellent agreement with predictions from the Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid models that account for the triaxial deformation of nuclear ground states in this region. We show that triaxial deformation impacts charge radii in models that feature shell effects, in contrast to what could be concluded from a liquid drop analysis. This indicates that this exotic type of deformation should not be neglected in regions where it is known to occur, even if its presence cannot be unambiguously inferred through laser spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Understanding baryon stopping at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider top energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nucleon exhibits a rich internal structure governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where its electric charge arises from valence quarks, while its spin and mass emerge from complex interactions among valence quarks, sea (anti-)quarks, and gluons. At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis emerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon number could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields connecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. Recent measurements by the STAR experiment are compatible with this scenario. In light of these measurements, this study aims to explore the mechanisms of baryon transport in high-energy nuclear collisions using the PYTHIA-8 framework, which incorporates a state-of-the-art hadronization model with advanced Color Flow (CF) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanisms that mimic signatures of a baryon junction. Within this model setup, we investigate (i) the rapidity slope of the net-baryon distributions in photon-included processes ($\gamma$+p) and (ii) baryon over charge transport in the isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. Our study highlights the importance of the CF and CR mechanisms in PYTHIA-8, which play a crucial role in baryon transport. The results show that the CF and CR schemes significantly affect the isobaric baryon-to-charge ratio, leading to different predictions for baryon stopping and underscoring the need to account for CF and CR effects in comparisons with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM), which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. On the physical side, such expressions allow a direct physical interpretation which we discuss.</description>

      <title>Initial stage jet momentum broadening in tBLFQ formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the momentum broadening of a high-energy quark jet in the large density gluon medium created right after the collision of two ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei, the Glasma. Previous Glasma studies modeled the jet as a classical probe particle, for which position and momentum are simultaneously determined. In this work, we use the light-front QCD Hamiltonian formalism to treat the jet as a fully quantum state. We compute its real-time evolution while propagating through the Glasma classical background fields, which act as an interaction potential in the quantum evolution of the jet. We present results for the momentum broadening and jet quenching parameter of a jet at mid-rapidity, with special emphasis on the anisotropies between the longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the collision axis. In addition, we compare our results to classical calculations, and initiate a study of the distinction between kinetic and canonic momentum in the context of jet momentum broadening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we relate the factorization for $e^+e^- \to h_1 h_2 X$ to the factorization for energy-energy correlators in the collinear limit. This enables us to give a nonperturbative proof of factorization for the energy correlators, relate the energy correlator jet function to transverse-momentum-sensitive dihadron fragmentation functions, and provide a rigorous description of the confinement transition region.</description>

      <title>Isotensor $\pi\pi \pi$ scattering with a $\rho$ resonant subsystem from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) determination of $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2 channel with angular momentum and parity $J^{P} = 1^+$. The calculation is performed using unphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\pi} \approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance. The analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively relates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results for $\pi\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the isospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic lattice volumes with box length ranging from $\approx 4/m_\pi$ to $6/m_\pi$. These combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the infinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled integral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Experimental review on the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to a predicted phenomena in quantum chromodynamics that manifests as a charge separation along an external magnetic field, driven by an imbalance of quark chirality. Searches for the CME has been carried out by azimuthal particle correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions where such a chirality imbalance is anticipated and a strong magnetic field is created in the initial stage. No conclusive experimental evidence on the CME has been established so far because of large background contributions to azimuthal correlation observables. We review the status of the experimental search for the CME, covering the observables used, the techniques to mitigate backgrounds, and the strengths and limitations of various experimental approaches, and outline a future prospect of the CME search in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>
