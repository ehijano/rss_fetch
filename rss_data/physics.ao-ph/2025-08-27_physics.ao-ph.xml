      <title>Huracan: A skillful end-to-end data-driven system for ensemble data assimilation and weather prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, machine learning-based data-driven weather prediction has been transforming operational weather forecasting by providing more accurate forecasts while using a mere fraction of computing power compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, those models still rely on initial conditions from NWP, putting an upper limit on their forecast abilities. A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet to match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work, we propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which combines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce highly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is not only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end ensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an accuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP competitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data. Notably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of ECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations. Our work is a major step forward in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction and opens up opportunities for further improving and revolutionizing operational weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09319v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Robustness of Extreme Precipitation Super-Resolution Across Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coarse spatial resolution of gridded climate models, such as general circulation models, limits their direct use in projecting socially relevant variables like extreme precipitation. Most downscaling methods estimate the conditional distributions of extremes by generating large ensembles, complicating the assessment of robustness under distributional shifts, such as those induced by climate change. To better understand and potentially improve robustness, we propose super-resolving the parameters of the target variable's probability distribution directly using analytically tractable mappings. Within a perfect-model framework over Switzerland, we demonstrate that vector generalized linear and additive models can super-resolve the generalized extreme value distribution of summer hourly precipitation extremes from coarse precipitation fields and topography. We introduce the notion of a "robustness gap", defined as the difference in predictive error between present-trained and future-trained models, and use it to diagnose how model structure affects the generalization of each quantile to a pseudo-global warming scenario. By evaluating multiple model configurations, we also identify an upper limit on the super-resolution factor based on the spatial auto- and cross-correlation of precipitation and elevation, beyond which coarse precipitation loses predictive value. Our framework is broadly applicable to variables governed by parametric distributions and offers a model-agnostic diagnostic for understanding when and why empirical downscaling generalizes to climate change and extremes.</description>

      <title>Leveraging GNN to Enhance MEF Method in Predicting ENSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights. In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical, physical, or hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Boreal Afforestation's Underestimated Cloud Influence on Earth's Energy Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI) is accelerating, partly due to declining planetary albedo from reduced cloud cover. Boreal afforestation can either mitigate or exacerbate this trend through competing biophysical feedbacks. While snow masking reduces surface albedo (+0.5 to +2.5 $W/m^2$ warming), forests can enhance low-level cloud cover (0.1-0.5%) and increase cloud reflectivity via biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), producing potential cooling (-1.8 to -6.7 $W/m^2$). This BVOC-aerosol-cloud pathway remains poorly constrained but may dominate under warmer conditions, challenging carbon-centric mitigation paradigms. Large-scale initiatives (e.g., Canada's 2 Billion Tree Commitment) risk unintended warming if not climate-smartly sited. We present a tiered decision-support framework that integrates biogeochemical and biophysical processes, explicitly incorporating cloud-aerosol feedbacks. Urgent inclusion of these feedbacks in policy is essential to ensure boreal afforestation contributes to EEI stabilization.</description>

      <title>Ensembles of Neural Surrogates for Parametric Sensitivity in Ocean Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes. However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify, making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives, but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout, and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in decision making.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in stratified rotating topographic wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence generation mechanisms in stratified, rotating flows past three-dimensional (3D) topography remain underexplored, particularly in submesoscale (SMS) regimes critical to geophysical applications. Using turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulations, we systematically dissect the interplay of stratification and rotation in governing the dynamics of wake turbulence. Our parametric study reveals that turbulent dissipation in the near wake is dominated by two distinct instabilities: (1) vertical shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), amplified by oblique dislocation of K\'arm\'an vortices under strong stratification, and (2) centrifugal/inertial instability (CI), which peaks at intermediate rotation rates (Rossby number order unity, SMS regime) and relatively weaker stratification. Notably, strong rotation dampens vertical shear and weakens KHI-driven turbulence, while strong stratification imposes smaller vertical length scales that restrict CI-driven turbulence. By quantifying dissipation across a broad parameter space of stratification and rotation, predictive relationships between the environmental parameters and instability dominance is established. These findings highlight the regime dependence of instability mechanisms and may inform targeted observational campaigns and numerical models of oceanic and atmospheric wakes.</description>

      <title>Global Forecasting of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Neural Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that integrate coupled physical equations forward in time are the traditional tools for simulating atmospheric processes and forecasting weather. With recent advancements in deep learning, Neural Weather Models (NeWMs) have emerged as competent medium-range NWP emulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP models. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial resolution (e.g., 0.25{\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key features of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)-among the most impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human activities-are challenging to forecast, as extrema like wind gusts, used as proxies for TC intensity, are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\deg} resolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing models on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the post-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity up to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent, preventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract predictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their initial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast consistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures over simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes. Overall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight, tracking-independent post-processing framework, our approach improves the accessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their democratization.</description>
