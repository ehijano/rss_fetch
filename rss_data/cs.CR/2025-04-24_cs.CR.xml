      <title>Blockchain-Driven Solutions for Carbon Credit Trading: A Decentralized Platform for SMEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for sustainability and compliance with global carbon regulations has posed significant challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized carbon credit trading platform tailored for SMEs in Taiwan, aiming to simplify the complex carbon trading process and lower market entry barriers. Drawing upon the Diffusion of Innovations theory and transaction cost economics, we illustrate how blockchain technology can reduce informational asymmetry and intermediary costs in carbon markets. By integrating Ethereum-based smart contracts, the platform automates transactions, enhances transparency, and reduces administrative burdens - addressing key obstacles such as technical complexity and market risks. A controlled experimental design was conducted to compare the proposed system with a conventional centralized carbon trading platform. Statistical analysis confirms its effectiveness in minimizing time and expenses while ensuring compliance with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the Clean Competition Act (CCA). User satisfaction was measured using the Kano model, with the results identifying essential features and prioritizing future enhancements. This study contributes a more comprehensive solution for SMEs seeking to achieve carbon neutrality, underscoring the transformative potential of blockchain technology in global carbon markets.</description>

      <title>Surveillance Disguised as Protection: A Comparative Analysis of Sideloaded and In-Store Parental Control Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parental control applications, software tools designed to manage and monitor children's online activities, serve as essential safeguards for parents in the digital age. However, their usage has sparked concerns about security and privacy violations inherent in various child monitoring products. Sideloaded software (i. e. apps installed outside official app stores) poses an increased risk, as it is not bound by the regulations of trusted platforms. Despite this, the market of sideloaded parental control software has remained widely unexplored by the research community. This paper examines 20 sideloaded parental control apps and compares them to 20 apps available on the Google Play Store. We base our analysis on privacy policies, Android package kit (APK) files, application behaviour, network traffic and application functionalities. Our findings reveal that sideloaded parental control apps fall short compared to their in-store counterparts, lacking specialised parental control features and safeguards against misuse while concealing themselves on the user's device. Alarmingly, three apps transmitted sensitive data unencrypted, half lacked a privacy policy and 8 out of 20 were flagged for potential stalkerware indicators of compromise (IOC).</description>

      <title>Paths Not Taken: A Secure Computing Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a tutorial on the proven but currently under-appreciated security mechanisms associated with "tagged" or "descriptor" architectures. The tutorial shows how the principles behind such architectures can be applied to mitigate or eliminate vulnerabilities. The tutorial incorporates systems engineering practices by presenting the mechanisms in an informal model of an integrated artifact in its operational environment. The artifact is a special-purpose hardware/software system called a "Guard" which robustly hosts defensive software. It is hoped that this tutorial may encourage teachers to include significant past work in their curricula and students who are self-teaching to add that work to their exploration of secure computing.</description>

      <title>Carbyne: An Ultra-Lightweight DoS-Resilient Mempool for Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies has significantly amplified the resource requirements for operating full nodes, creating substantial barriers to entry. Unlike miners, who are financially incentivized through block rewards and transaction fees, full nodes lack direct economic compensation for their critical role in maintaining the network. A key resource burden is the transaction pool, which is particularly memory-intensive as it temporarily stores unconfirmed transactions awaiting verification and propagation across the network. We present Neonpool, a novel optimization for transaction pool leveraging bloom filter variants to drastically reduce memory consumption by up to 200 (e.g., 400 MB to 2 MB) while maintaining over 99.99% transaction processing accuracy. Implemented in C++ and evaluated on unique Bitcoin and Ethereum datasets, Neonpool enables efficient operation on lightweight clients, such as smartphones, IoT devices, and systems-on-a-chip, without requiring a hard fork. By lowering the cost of node participation, Neonpool enhances decentralization and strengthens the overall security and robustness of cryptocurrency networks.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption: A Case for Code-Based Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows secure and privacy-protected computation on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it. Since Shor's algorithm rendered prime factorisation and discrete logarithm-based ciphers insecure with quantum computations, researchers have been working on building post-quantum homomorphic encryption (PQHE) algorithms. Most of the current PQHE algorithms are secured by Lattice-based problems and there have been limited attempts to build ciphers based on error-correcting code-based problems. This review presents an overview of the current approaches to building PQHE schemes and justifies code-based encryption as a novel way to diversify post-quantum algorithms. We present the mathematical underpinnings of existing code-based cryptographic frameworks and their security and efficiency guarantees. We compare lattice-based and code-based homomorphic encryption solutions identifying challenges that have inhibited the progress of code-based schemes. We finally propose five new research directions to advance post-quantum code-based homomorphic encryption.</description>

      <title>Trusted Identities for AI Agents: Leveraging Telco-Hosted eSIM Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of autonomous AI agents in enterprise and industrial environments introduces a critical challenge: how to securely assign, verify, and manage their identities across distributed systems. Existing identity frameworks based on API keys, certificates, or application-layer credentials lack the infrastructure-grade trust, lifecycle control, and interoperability needed to manage agents operating independently in sensitive contexts.
  In this paper, we propose a conceptual architecture that leverages telecom-grade eSIM infrastructure, specifically hosted by mobile network operators (MNOs), to serve as a root of trust for AI agents. Rather than embedding SIM credentials in hardware devices, we envision a model where telcos host secure, certified hardware modules (eUICC or HSM) that store and manage agent-specific eSIM profiles. Agents authenticate remotely via cryptographic APIs or identity gateways, enabling scalable and auditable access to enterprise networks and services.
  We explore use cases such as onboarding enterprise automation agents, securing AI-driven financial systems, and enabling trust in inter-agent communications. We identify current limitations in GSMA and 3GPP standards, particularly their device centric assumptions, and propose extensions to support non-physical, software-based agents within trusted execution environments. This paper is intended as a conceptual framework to open discussion around standardization, security architecture, and the role of telecom infrastructure in the evolving agent economy.</description>

      <title>Security-First AI: Foundations for Robust and Trustworthy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversation around artificial intelligence (AI) often focuses on safety, transparency, accountability, alignment, and responsibility. However, AI security (i.e., the safeguarding of data, models, and pipelines from adversarial manipulation) underpins all of these efforts. This manuscript posits that AI security must be prioritized as a foundational layer. We present a hierarchical view of AI challenges, distinguishing security from safety, and argue for a security-first approach to enable trustworthy and resilient AI systems. We discuss core threat models, key attack vectors, and emerging defense mechanisms, concluding that a metric-driven approach to AI security is essential for robust AI safety, transparency, and accountability.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Vulnerability Analysis of NFT Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the research experiment of this article, our research work is divided into several stages. Firstly, we collected a large number of smart contract codes and classified them, identifying several common defects, including Risky Mutably Porxy, ERC-721 Recentrancy, Unlimited Mining, Missing Requirements, and Public Burns. Secondly, we used Python to process the smart contracts. On the one hand, we modified the file names, and on the other hand, we batched the process of the content for analysis and application. Next, we built a model of the decision tree. Firstly, we carried out the feature extraction. We selected the algorithm and divided the data. After comparing and processing, we chose the CART classification tree to process. By gene coefficient, we analyzed and sorted the data, and got the initial model of the decision tree. Then, we introduced the random forest model on the basis of the decision tree. From abstracting the same amount of samples to selecting features randomly.From adjusting and optimizing parameters to completing the construction of the forest model. Finally, we compared and analyzed the decision tree, random forest, and self-built model in the paper and drew general conclusions.</description>

      <title>DMind Benchmark: The First Comprehensive Benchmark for LLM Evaluation in the Web3 Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant progress on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized and rapidly evolving domains such as Web3 remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce DMind Benchmark, a novel framework that systematically tests LLMs across nine key categories encompassing blockchain fundamentals, infrastructure, smart contract analysis, decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), token economics, meme concepts, and security vulnerabilities.
  DMind Benchmark goes beyond conventional multiple-choice questions by incorporating domain-specific subjective tasks (e.g., smart contract code auditing and repair, numeric reasoning on on-chain data, and fill-in assessments), thereby capturing real-world complexities and stress-testing model adaptability. We evaluate fifteen popular LLMs (from ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, and Gemini series) on DMind Benchmark, uncovering performance gaps in Web3-specific reasoning and application, particularly in emerging areas like token economics and meme concepts. Even the strongest models face significant challenges in identifying subtle security vulnerabilities and analyzing complex DeFi mechanisms. To foster progress in this area, we publicly release our benchmark dataset, evaluation pipeline, and annotated results at http://www.dmind.ai, offering a valuable resource for advancing specialized domain adaptation and the development of more robust Web3-enabled LLMs.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable and Lightweight AI for Real-Time Cyber Threat Hunting in Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cyber threats continue to evolve, securing edge networks has become increasingly challenging due to their distributed nature and resource limitations. Many AI-driven threat detection systems rely on complex deep learning models, which, despite their high accuracy, suffer from two major drawbacks: lack of interpretability and high computational cost. Black-box AI models make it difficult for security analysts to understand the reasoning behind their predictions, limiting their practical deployment. Moreover, conventional deep learning techniques demand significant computational resources, rendering them unsuitable for edge devices with limited processing power. To address these issues, this study introduces an Explainable and Lightweight AI (ELAI) framework designed for real-time cyber threat detection in edge networks. Our approach integrates interpretable machine learning algorithms with optimized lightweight deep learning techniques, ensuring both transparency and computational efficiency. The proposed system leverages decision trees, attention-based deep learning, and federated learning to enhance detection accuracy while maintaining explainability. We evaluate ELAI using benchmark cybersecurity datasets, such as CICIDS and UNSW-NB15, assessing its performance across diverse cyberattack scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high detection rates with minimal false positives, all while significantly reducing computational demands compared to traditional deep learning methods. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a novel interpretable AI-based cybersecurity model tailored for edge computing environments, (2) an optimized lightweight deep learning approach for real-time cyber threat detection, and (3) a comprehensive analysis of explainability techniques in AI-driven cybersecurity applications.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach for Safe and Secure Large Language Models against Threatening and Toxic Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have made remarkable progress, but concerns about potential biases and harmful content persist. To address these apprehensions, we introduce a practical solution for ensuring LLM's safe and ethical use. Our novel approach focuses on a post-generation correction mechanism, the BART-Corrective Model, which adjusts generated content to ensure safety and security. Unlike relying solely on model fine-tuning or prompt engineering, our method provides a robust data-centric alternative for mitigating harmful content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on multiple toxic datasets, which show a significant reduction in mean toxicity and jail-breaking scores after integration. Specifically, our results show a reduction of 15% and 21% in mean toxicity and jail-breaking scores with GPT-4, a substantial reduction of 28% and 5% with PaLM2, a reduction of approximately 26% and 23% with Mistral-7B, and a reduction of 11.1% and 19% with Gemma-2b-it. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach to improve the safety and security of LLM, making them more suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Prompt Wall (I): A Real-World Case Study of Attacking ChatGPT via Lightweight Prompt Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents a real-world case study demonstrating how prompt injection can attack large language model platforms such as ChatGPT according to a proposed injection framework. By providing three real-world examples, we show how adversarial prompts can be injected via user inputs, web-based retrieval, and system-level agent instructions. These attacks, though lightweight and low-cost, can cause persistent and misleading behaviors in LLM outputs. Our case study reveals that even commercial-grade LLMs remain vulnerable to subtle manipulations that bypass safety filters and influence user decisions. \textbf{More importantly, we stress that this report is not intended as an attack guide, but as a technical alert. As ethical researchers, we aim to raise awareness and call upon developers, especially those at OpenAI, to treat prompt-level security as a critical design priority.</description>

      <title>ReGraph: A Tool for Binary Similarity Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary Code Similarity Detection (BCSD) is not only essential for security tasks such as vulnerability identification but also for code copying detection, yet it remains challenging due to binary stripping and diverse compilation environments. Existing methods tend to adopt increasingly complex neural networks for better accuracy performance. The computation time increases with the complexity. Even with powerful GPUs, the treatment of large-scale software becomes time-consuming. To address these issues, we present a framework called ReGraph to efficiently compare binary code functions across architectures and optimization levels. Our evaluation with public datasets highlights that ReGraph exhibits a significant speed advantage, performing 700 times faster than Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based methods while maintaining comparable accuracy results with respect to the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Meets Adaptive Honeypots: A Trust-Aware Approach to Next-Gen IoT Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge computing-based Next-Generation Wireless Networks (NGWN)-IoT offer enhanced bandwidth capacity for large-scale service provisioning but remain vulnerable to evolving cyber threats. Existing intrusion detection and prevention methods provide limited security as adversaries continually adapt their attack strategies. We propose a dynamic attack detection and prevention approach to address this challenge. First, blockchain-based authentication uses the Deoxys Authentication Algorithm (DAA) to verify IoT device legitimacy before data transmission. Next, a bi-stage intrusion detection system is introduced: the first stage uses signature-based detection via an Improved Random Forest (IRF) algorithm. In contrast, the second stage applies feature-based anomaly detection using a Diffusion Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN). To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) and maintain Service Level Agreements (SLA), trust-aware service migration is performed using Heap-Based Optimization (HBO). Additionally, on-demand virtual High-Interaction honeypots deceive attackers and extract attack patterns, which are securely stored using the Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) to enhance signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The proposed framework is implemented in the NS3 simulation environment and evaluated against existing methods across multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, attack detection rate, false negative rate, precision, recall, ROC curve, memory usage, CPU usage, and execution time. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, reinforcing the security of NGWN-enabled IoT ecosystems</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of GNN Explanations for Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) are critical for analyzing program execution and characterizing malware behavior. With the growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), CFG-based representations have proven highly effective for malware detection. This study proposes a novel framework that dynamically constructs CFGs and embeds node features using a hybrid approach combining rule-based encoding and autoencoder-based embedding. A GNN-based classifier is then constructed to detect malicious behavior from the resulting graph representations. To improve model interpretability, we apply state-of-the-art explainability techniques, including GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, and CaptumExplainer, the latter is utilized three attribution methods: Integrated Gradients, Guided Backpropagation, and Saliency. In addition, we introduce a novel aggregation method, called RankFusion, that integrates the outputs of the top-performing explainers to enhance the explanation quality. We also evaluate explanations using two subgraph extraction strategies, including the proposed Greedy Edge-wise Composition (GEC) method for improved structural coherence. A comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, fidelity, and consistency metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of accurate identification of malware samples and generating reliable and interpretable explanations.</description>

      <title>Property-Preserving Hashing for $\ell_1$-Distance Predicates: Applications to Countering Adversarial Input Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptual hashing is used to detect whether an input image is similar to a reference image with a variety of security applications. Recently, they have been shown to succumb to adversarial input attacks which make small imperceptible changes to the input image yet the hashing algorithm does not detect its similarity to the original image. Property-preserving hashing (PPH) is a recent construct in cryptography, which preserves some property (predicate) of its inputs in the hash domain. Researchers have so far shown constructions of PPH for Hamming distance predicates, which, for instance, outputs 1 if two inputs are within Hamming distance $t$. A key feature of PPH is its strong correctness guarantee, i.e., the probability that the predicate will not be correctly evaluated in the hash domain is negligible. Motivated by the use case of detecting similar images under adversarial setting, we propose the first PPH construction for an $\ell_1$-distance predicate. Roughly, this predicate checks if the two one-sided $\ell_1$-distances between two images are within a threshold $t$. Since many adversarial attacks use $\ell_2$-distance (related to $\ell_1$-distance) as the objective function to perturb the input image, by appropriately choosing the threshold $t$, we can force the attacker to add considerable noise to evade detection, and hence significantly deteriorate the image quality. Our proposed scheme is highly efficient, and runs in time $O(t^2)$. For grayscale images of size $28 \times 28$, we can evaluate the predicate in $0.0784$ seconds when pixel values are perturbed by up to $1 \%$. For larger RGB images of size $224 \times 224$, by dividing the image into 1,000 blocks, we achieve times of $0.0128$ seconds per block for $1 \%$ change, and up to $0.2641$ seconds per block for $14\%$ change.</description>

      <title>VideoMark: A Distortion-Free Robust Watermarking Framework for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents VideoMark, a training-free robust watermarking framework for video diffusion models. As diffusion models advance in generating highly realistic videos, the need for reliable content attribution mechanisms has become critical. While watermarking techniques for image diffusion models have made progress, directly extending these methods to videos presents unique challenges due to variable video lengths and vulnerability to temporal attacks. VideoMark addresses these limitations through a frame-wise watermarking strategy using pseudorandom error correction (PRC) codes to embed watermark information during the generation process. Our method generates an extended watermark message sequence and randomly selects starting positions for each video, ensuring uniform noise distribution in the latent space and maintaining generation quality. For watermark extraction, we introduce a Temporal Matching Module (TMM) that uses edit distance to align decoded messages with the original watermark sequence, providing robustness against temporal attacks such as frame deletion. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoMark achieves higher decoding accuracy than existing methods while maintaining video quality on par with watermark-free generation. Importantly, our watermark remains undetectable to attackers without the secret key, ensuring strong imperceptibility compared to other watermarking frameworks. VideoMark provides a practical solution for content attribution in diffusion-based video generation without requiring additional training or compromising video quality. Our code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/KYRIE-LI11/VideoMark}{https://github.com/KYRIE-LI11/VideoMark}.</description>

      <title>Give LLMs a Security Course: Securing Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation via Knowledge Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) leverages external knowledge to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in code synthesis, improving the functional correctness of the generated code. However, existing RACG systems largely overlook security, leading to substantial risks. Especially, the poisoning of malicious code into knowledge bases can mislead LLMs, resulting in the generation of insecure outputs, which poses a critical threat in modern software development. To address this, we propose a security-hardening framework for RACG systems, CodeGuarder, that shifts the paradigm from retrieving only functional code examples to incorporating both functional code and security knowledge. Our framework constructs a security knowledge base from real-world vulnerability databases, including secure code samples and root cause annotations. For each code generation query, a retriever decomposes the query into fine-grained sub-tasks and fetches relevant security knowledge. To prioritize critical security guidance, we introduce a re-ranking and filtering mechanism by leveraging the LLMs' susceptibility to different vulnerability types. This filtered security knowledge is seamlessly integrated into the generation prompt. Our evaluation shows CodeGuarder significantly improves code security rates across various LLMs, achieving average improvements of 20.12\% in standard RACG, and 31.53\% and 21.91\% under two distinct poisoning scenarios without compromising functional correctness. Furthermore, CodeGuarder demonstrates strong generalization, enhancing security even when the targeted language's security knowledge is lacking. This work presents CodeGuarder as a pivotal advancement towards building secure and trustworthy RACG systems.</description>

      <title>From Past to Present: A Survey of Malicious URL Detection Techniques, Datasets and Code Repositories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious URLs persistently threaten the cybersecurity ecosystem, by either deceiving users into divulging private data or distributing harmful payloads to infiltrate host systems. Gaining timely insights into the current state of this ongoing battle holds significant importance. However, existing reviews exhibit 4 critical gaps: 1) Their reliance on algorithm-centric taxonomies obscures understanding of how detection approaches exploit specific modal information channels; 2) They fail to incorporate pivotal LLM/Transformer-based defenses; 3) No open-source implementations are collected to facilitate benchmarking; 4) Insufficient dataset coverage.This paper presents a comprehensive review of malicious URL detection technologies, systematically analyzing methods from traditional blacklisting to advanced deep learning approaches (e.g. Transformer, GNNs, and LLMs). Unlike prior surveys, we propose a novel modality-based taxonomy that categorizes existing works according to their primary data modalities (URL, HTML, Visual, etc.). This hierarchical classification enables both rigorous technical analysis and clear understanding of multimodal information utilization. Furthermore, to establish a profile of accessible datasets and address the lack of standardized benchmarking (where current studies often lack proper baseline comparisons), we curate and analyze: 1) publicly available datasets (2016-2024), and 2) open-source implementations from published works(2013-2025). Then, we outline essential design principles and architectural frameworks for product-level implementations. The review concludes by examining emerging challenges and proposing actionable directions for future research. We maintain a GitHub repository for ongoing curating datasets and open-source implementations: https://github.com/sevenolu7/Malicious-URL-Detection-Open-Source/tree/master.</description>

      <title>Seeking Flat Minima over Diverse Surrogates for Improved Adversarial Transferability: A Theoretical Framework and Algorithmic Instantiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer-based black-box adversarial attack setting poses the challenge of crafting an adversarial example (AE) on known surrogate models that remain effective against unseen target models. Due to the practical importance of this task, numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge. However, most previous methods are heuristically designed and intuitively justified, lacking a theoretical foundation. To bridge this gap, we derive a novel transferability bound that offers provable guarantees for adversarial transferability. Our theoretical analysis has the advantages of \textit{(i)} deepening our understanding of previous methods by building a general attack framework and \textit{(ii)} providing guidance for designing an effective attack algorithm. Our theoretical results demonstrate that optimizing AEs toward flat minima over the surrogate model set, while controlling the surrogate-target model shift measured by the adversarial model discrepancy, yields a comprehensive guarantee for AE transferability. The results further lead to a general transfer-based attack framework, within which we observe that previous methods consider only partial factors contributing to the transferability. Algorithmically, inspired by our theoretical results, we first elaborately construct the surrogate model set in which models exhibit diverse adversarial vulnerabilities with respect to AEs to narrow an instantiated adversarial model discrepancy. Then, a \textit{model-Diversity-compatible Reverse Adversarial Perturbation} (DRAP) is generated to effectively promote the flatness of AEs over diverse surrogate models to improve transferability. Extensive experiments on NIPS2017 and CIFAR-10 datasets against various target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack.</description>

      <title>Amplified Vulnerabilities: Structured Jailbreak Attacks on LLM-based Multi-Agent Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), leveraging collaborative interactions among Large Language Models (LLMs), aim to enhance reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. However, the security implications of their iterative dialogues and role-playing characteristics, particularly susceptibility to jailbreak attacks eliciting harmful content, remain critically underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the jailbreak vulnerabilities of four prominent MAD frameworks built upon leading commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DeepSeek) without compromising internal agents. We introduce a novel structured prompt-rewriting framework specifically designed to exploit MAD dynamics via narrative encapsulation, role-driven escalation, iterative refinement, and rhetorical obfuscation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MAD systems are inherently more vulnerable than single-agent setups. Crucially, our proposed attack methodology significantly amplifies this fragility, increasing average harmfulness from 28.14% to 80.34% and achieving attack success rates as high as 80% in certain scenarios. These findings reveal intrinsic vulnerabilities in MAD architectures and underscore the urgent need for robust, specialized defenses prior to real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Intrusion Detection System Using Snort IDS Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are integral to safeguarding networks by detecting and responding to threats from malicious traffic or compromised devices. However, standalone IDS deployments often fall short when addressing the increasing complexity and scale of modern cyberattacks. This paper proposes a Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) that leverages Snort, an open-source network intrusion detection system, to enhance detection accuracy and reduce false positives. The proposed architecture connects multiple Snort IDS nodes to a centralised node and integrates with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform to facilitate real-time data sharing, correlation, and analysis. The CIDS design includes a scalable configuration of Snort sensors, a centralised database for log storage, and LogScale SIEM for advanced analytics and visualisation. By aggregating and analysing intrusion data from multiple nodes, the system enables improved detection of distributed and sophisticated attack patterns that standalone IDSs may miss. Performance evaluation against simulated attacks, including Nmap port scans and ICMP flood attacks, demonstrates our CIDS's ability to efficiently process large-scale network traffic, detect threats with higher accuracy, and reduce alert fatigue. This paper highlights the potential of CIDS in modern network environments and explores future enhancements, such as integrating machine learning for advanced threat detection and creating public datasets to support collaborative research. The proposed CIDS framework provides a promising foundation for building more resilient and adaptive network security systems.</description>

      <title>LaSDVS : A Post-Quantum Secure Compact Strong-Designated Verifier Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital signatures are fundamental cryptographic primitives that ensure the authenticity and integrity of digital communication. However, in scenarios involving sensitive interactions -- such as e-voting or e-cash -- there is a growing need for more controlled signing mechanisms. Strong-Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) offers such control by allowing the signer to specify and restrict the verifier of a signature. The existing state-of-the-art SDVS are mostly based on number-theoretic hardness assumptions. Thus, they are not secure against quantum attacks. Moreover, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)-based SDVS are inefficient and have large key and signature sizes. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an efficient post-quantum SDVS (namely, LaSDVS) based on ideal lattices under the hardness assumptions of the Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE problems. LaSDVS achieves advanced security properties including strong unforgeability under chosen-message attacks, non-transferability, non-delegatability, and signer anonymity. By employing the algebraic structure of rings and the gadget trapdoor mechanism of Micciancio et al., we design LaSDVS to minimize computational overhead and significantly reduce key and signature sizes. Notably, our scheme achieves a compact signature size of $\mathcal{O}(n\log q)$, compared to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ size, where $n$ is the security parameter, in the existing state-of-the-art PQC designs. To the best of our knowledge, LaSDVS offers the \textit{smallest private key and signature size} among the existing PQC-based SDVS schemes.</description>

      <title>Case Study: Fine-tuning Small Language Models for Accurate and Private CWE Detection in Python Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and analyzing code for security vulnerabilities, such as Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure and substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing sensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs. This work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable alternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection. We investigated whether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be effectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within Python code. To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500 examples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data generation coupled with meticulous human review. Initial tests confirmed that the base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples. However, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM achieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99% accuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score. These results strongly suggest that fine-tuned SLMs can serve as highly accurate and efficient tools for CWE detection, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution for integrating advanced security analysis directly into development workflows.</description>

      <title>MAYA: Addressing Inconsistencies in Generative Password Guessing through a Unified Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to their integration across various fields, including password guessing, aiming to generate passwords that resemble human-created ones in complexity, structure, and patterns. Despite generative model's promise, inconsistencies in prior research and a lack of rigorous evaluation have hindered a comprehensive understanding of their true potential. In this paper, we introduce MAYA, a unified, customizable, plug-and-play password benchmarking framework. MAYA provides a standardized approach for evaluating generative password-guessing models through a rigorous set of advanced testing scenarios and a collection of eight real-life password datasets. Using MAYA, we comprehensively evaluate six state-of-the-art approaches, which have been re-implemented and adapted to ensure standardization, for a total of over 15,000 hours of computation. Our findings indicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover, models learn and generate different password distributions, enabling a multi-model attack that outperforms the best individual model. By releasing MAYA, we aim to foster further research, providing the community with a new tool to consistently and reliably benchmark password-generation techniques. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/williamcorrias/MAYA-Password-Benchmarking</description>

      <title>CAIBA: Multicast Source Authentication for CAN Through Reactive Bit Flipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controller Area Networks (CANs) are the backbone for reliable intra-vehicular communication. Recent cyberattacks have, however, exposed the weaknesses of CAN, which was designed without any security considerations in the 1980s. Current efforts to retrofit security via intrusion detection or message authentication codes are insufficient to fully secure CAN as they cannot adequately protect against masquerading attacks, where a compromised communication device, a so-called electronic control units, imitates another device. To remedy this situation, multicast source authentication is required to reliably identify the senders of messages. In this paper, we present CAIBA, a novel multicast source authentication scheme specifically designed for communication buses like CAN. CAIBA relies on an authenticator overwriting authentication tags on-the-fly, such that a receiver only reads a valid tag if not only the integrity of a message but also its source can be verified. To integrate CAIBA into CAN, we devise a special message authentication scheme and a reactive bit overwriting mechanism. We achieve interoperability with legacy CAN devices, while protecting receivers implementing the AUTOSAR SecOC standard against masquerading attacks without communication overhead or verification delays.</description>

      <title>Snorkeling in dark waters: A longitudinal surface exploration of unique Tor Hidden Services (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Onion Router (Tor) is a controversial network whose utility is constantly under scrutiny. On the one hand, it allows for anonymous interaction and cooperation of users seeking untraceable navigation on the Internet. This freedom also attracts criminals who aim to thwart law enforcement investigations, e.g., trading illegal products or services such as drugs or weapons. Tor allows delivering content without revealing the actual hosting address, by means of .onion (or hidden) services. Different from regular domains, these services can not be resolved by traditional name services, are not indexed by regular search engines, and they frequently change. This generates uncertainty about the extent and size of the Tor network and the type of content offered.
  In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of the Tor Network. We leverage our crawler, dubbed Mimir, which automatically collects and visits content linked within the pages to collect a dataset of pages from more than 25k sites. We analyze the topology of the Tor Network, including its depth and reachability from the surface web. We define a set of heuristics to detect the presence of replicated content (mirrors) and show that most of the analyzed content in the Dark Web (82% approx.) is a replica of other content. Also, we train a custom Machine Learning classifier to understand the type of content the hidden services offer. Overall, our study provides new insights into the Tor network, highlighting the importance of initial seeding for focus on specific topics, and optimize the crawling process. We show that previous work on large-scale Tor measurements does not consider the presence of mirrors, which biases their understanding of the Dark Web topology and the distribution of content.</description>

      <title>Building A Secure Agentic AI Application Leveraging A2A Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi agent collaboration, robust protocols such as Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) become essential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of these complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is essential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security analysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and operational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication development. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI risks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues in A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task execution integrity, and authentication methodologies.
  Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development methodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and effective A2A systems. Our analysis also explores how the synergy between A2A and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can further enhance secure interoperability. This paper equips developers and architects with the knowledge and practical guidance needed to confidently leverage the A2A protocol for building robust and secure next generation agentic applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and Efficient Dynamic Memory Management for Hardware Enclaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second version of Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), or SGX2, adds dynamic management of enclave memory and threads. The first version required the address space and thread counts to be fixed before execution. The Enclave Dynamic Memory Management (EDMM) feature of SGX2 has the potential to lower launch times and overall execution time. Despite reducing the enclave loading time by 28--93%, straightforward EDMM adoption strategies actually slow execution time down by as much as 58%. Using the Gramine library OS as a representative enclave runtime environment, this paper shows how to recover EDMM performance. The paper explains how implementing mutual distrust between the OS and enclave increases the cost of modifying page mappings. The paper then describes and evaluates a series of optimizations on application benchmarks, showing that these optimizations effectively eliminate the overheads of EDMM while retaining EDMM's performance and flexibility gains.</description>

      <title>CLPSTNet: A Progressive Multi-Scale Convolutional Steganography Model Integrating Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a large number of works have introduced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into image steganography, which transform traditional steganography methods such as hand-crafted features and prior knowledge design into steganography methods that neural networks autonomically learn information embedding. However, due to the inherent complexity of digital images, issues of invisibility and security persist when using CNN models for information embedding. In this paper, we propose Curriculum Learning Progressive Steganophy Network (CLPSTNet). The network consists of multiple progressive multi-scale convolutional modules that integrate Inception structures and dilated convolutions. The module contains multiple branching pathways, starting from a smaller convolutional kernel and dilatation rate, extracting the basic, local feature information from the feature map, and gradually expanding to the convolution with a larger convolutional kernel and dilatation rate for perceiving the feature information of a larger receptive field, so as to realize the multi-scale feature extraction from shallow to deep, and from fine to coarse, allowing the shallow secret information features to be refined in different fusion stages. The experimental results show that the proposed CLPSTNet not only has high PSNR , SSIM metrics and decoding accuracy on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, but also the steganographic images generated by CLPSTNet have low steganalysis scores.You can find our code at \href{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}.</description>

      <title>Public-Key Quantum Fire and Key-Fire From Classical Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fire was recently formalized by Bostanci, Nehoran and Zhandry (STOC 25). This notion considers a distribution of quantum states that can be efficiently cloned, but cannot be converted into a classical string. Previously, work of Nehoran and Zhandry (ITCS 24) showed how to construct quantum fire relative to an inefficient unitary oracle. Later, the work of Bostanci, Nehoran, Zhandry gave a candidate construction based on group action assumptions, and proved the correctness of their scheme; however, even in the classical oracle model they only conjectured the security, and no security proof was given.
  In this work, we give the first construction of public-key quantum fire relative to a classical oracle, and prove its security unconditionally. This gives the first classical oracle seperation between the two fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that are equivalent in the information-theoretic setting: no-cloning and no-telegraphing.
  Going further, we introduce a stronger notion called quantum key-fire where the clonable fire states can be used to run a functionality (such as a signing or decryption key), and prove a secure construction relative to a classical oracle. As an application of this notion, we get the first public-key encryption scheme whose secret key is clonable but satisfies unbounded leakage-resilience (Cakan, Goyal, Liu-Zhang, Ribeiro [TCC 24]), relative to a classical oracle. Unbounded leakage-resilience is closely related to, and can be seen as a generalization of the notion of no-telegraphing.
  For all of our constructions, the oracles can be made efficient (i.e. polynomial time), assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions.</description>

      <title>Private Federated Learning using Preference-Optimized Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practical settings, differentially private Federated learning (DP-FL) is the dominant method for training models from private, on-device client data. Recent work has suggested that DP-FL may be enhanced or outperformed by methods that use DP synthetic data (Wu et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024). The primary algorithms for generating DP synthetic data for FL applications require careful prompt engineering based on public information and/or iterative private client feedback. Our key insight is that the private client feedback collected by prior DP synthetic data methods (Hou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) can be viewed as a preference ranking. Our algorithm, Preference Optimization for Private Client Data (POPri) harnesses client feedback using preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune LLMs to generate high-quality DP synthetic data. To evaluate POPri, we release LargeFedBench, a new federated text benchmark for uncontaminated LLM evaluations on federated client data. POPri substantially improves the utility of DP synthetic data relative to prior work on LargeFedBench datasets and an existing benchmark from Xie et al. (2024). POPri closes the gap between next-token prediction accuracy in the fully-private and non-private settings by up to 68%, compared to 52% for prior synthetic data methods, and 10% for state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods. The code and data are available at https://github.com/meiyuw/POPri.</description>

      <title>Resource Reduction in Multiparty Quantum Secret Sharing of both Classical and Quantum Information under Noisy Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) enables secure distribution of information among multiple parties but remains vulnerable to noise. We analyze the effects of bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude damping noise on the multiparty QSS for classical message (QSSCM) and secret sharing of quantum information (SSQI) protocols proposed by Zhang et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 71:044301, 2005). To scale down these effects, we introduce an efficient quantum error correction (QEC) scheme based on a simplified version of Shor's code. Leveraging the specific structure of the QSS protocols, we reduce the qubit overhead from the standard 9 of Shor's code to as few as 3 while still achieving lower average error rates than existing QEC methods. Thus, our approach can also be adopted for other single-qubit-based quantum protocols. Simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the protocols' resilience, improving their practicality for real-world deployment.</description>

Abstract: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is becoming an increasingly important tool in regulatory and technical spaces to introduce more transparency and security into a project's software supply chain.
  Artificial intelligence (AI) projects face unique challenges beyond the security of their software, and thus require a more expansive approach to a bill of materials. In this report, we introduce the concept of an AI-BOM, expanding on the SBOM to include the documentation of algorithms, data collection methods, frameworks and libraries, licensing information, and standard compliance.</description>

      <title>The Sponge is Quantum Indifferentiable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sponge is a cryptographic construction that turns a public permutation into a hash function. When instantiated with the Keccak permutation, the sponge forms the NIST SHA-3 standard. SHA-3 is a core component of most post-quantum public-key cryptography schemes slated for worldwide adoption.
  While one can consider many security properties for the sponge, the ultimate one is indifferentiability from a random oracle, or simply indifferentiability. The sponge was proved indifferentiable against classical adversaries by Bertoni et al. in 2008. Despite significant efforts in the years since, little is known about sponge security against quantum adversaries, even for simple properties like preimage or collision resistance beyond a single round. This is primarily due to the lack of a satisfactory quantum analog of the lazy sampling technique for permutations.
  In this work, we develop a specialized technique that overcomes this barrier in the case of the sponge. We prove that the sponge is in fact indifferentiable from a random oracle against quantum adversaries. Our result establishes that the domain extension technique behind SHA-3 is secure in the post-quantum setting. Our indifferentiability bound for the sponge is a loose $O(\mathsf{poly}(q) 2^{-\mathsf{min}(r, c)/4})$, but we also give bounds on preimage and collision resistance that are tighter.</description>

      <title>A Language for Smart Contracts with Secure Control Flow (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contracts are frequently vulnerable to control-flow attacks based on confused deputies, reentrancy, and incorrect error handling. These attacks exploit the complexity of interactions among multiple possibly unknown contracts. Existing best practices to prevent vulnerabilities rely on code patterns and heuristics that produce both false positives and false negatives. Even with extensive audits and heuristic tools, new vulnerabilities continue to arise, routinely costing tens of millions of dollars.
  We introduce SCIF, a language for secure smart contracts, that addresses these classes of control-flow attacks. By extending secure information flow mechanisms in a principled way, SCIF enforces both classic end-to-end information flow security and new security restrictions on control flow, even when SCIF contracts interact with malicious non-SCIF code. SCIF is implemented as a compiler to Solidity. We show how SCIF can secure contracts with minimal overhead through case studies of applications with intricate security reasoning and a large corpus of insecure code.</description>

      <title>Top Score on the Wrong Exam: On Benchmarking in Machine Learning for Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to our survey of machine learning for vulnerability detection (ML4VD), 9 in every 10 papers published in the past five years define ML4VD as a function-level binary classification problem:
  Given a function, does it contain a security flaw?
  From our experience as security researchers, faced with deciding whether a given function makes the program vulnerable to attacks, we would often first want to understand the context in which this function is called.
  In this paper, we study how often this decision can really be made without further context and study both vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions in the most popular ML4VD datasets. We call a function "vulnerable" if it was involved in a patch of an actual security flaw and confirmed to cause the program's vulnerability. It is "non-vulnerable" otherwise. We find that in almost all cases this decision cannot be made without further context. Vulnerable functions are often vulnerable only because a corresponding vulnerability-inducing calling context exists while non-vulnerable functions would often be vulnerable if a corresponding context existed.
  But why do ML4VD techniques achieve high scores even though there is demonstrably not enough information in these samples? Spurious correlations: We find that high scores can be achieved even when only word counts are available. This shows that these datasets can be exploited to achieve high scores without actually detecting any security vulnerabilities.
  We conclude that the prevailing problem statement of ML4VD is ill-defined and call into question the internal validity of this growing body of work. Constructively, we call for more effective benchmarking methodologies to evaluate the true capabilities of ML4VD, propose alternative problem statements, and examine broader implications for the evaluation of machine learning and programming analysis research.</description>

      <title>Attention Tracker: Detecting Prompt Injection Attacks in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs manipulate the model into ignoring original instructions and executing designated action. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of these attacks by analyzing the attention patterns within LLMs. We introduce the concept of the distraction effect, where specific attention heads, termed important heads, shift focus from the original instruction to the injected instruction. Building on this discovery, we propose Attention Tracker, a training-free detection method that tracks attention patterns on instruction to detect prompt injection attacks without the need for additional LLM inference. Our method generalizes effectively across diverse models, datasets, and attack types, showing an AUROC improvement of up to 10.0% over existing methods, and performs well even on small LLMs. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through extensive evaluations and provide insights into safeguarding LLM-integrated systems from prompt injection vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Make Shuffling Great Again: A Side-Channel Resistant Fisher-Yates Algorithm for Protecting Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network models implemented in embedded devices have been shown to be susceptible to side-channel attacks (SCAs), allowing recovery of proprietary model parameters, such as weights and biases. There are already available countermeasure methods currently used for protecting cryptographic implementations that can be tailored to protect embedded neural network models. Shuffling, a hiding-based countermeasure that randomly shuffles the order of computations, was shown to be vulnerable to SCA when the Fisher-Yates algorithm is used. In this paper, we propose a design of an SCA-secure version of the Fisher-Yates algorithm. By integrating the masking technique for modular reduction and Blakely's method for modular multiplication, we effectively remove the vulnerability in the division operation that led to side-channel leakage in the original version of the algorithm. We experimentally evaluate that the countermeasure is effective against SCA by implementing a correlation power analysis attack on an embedded neural network model implemented on ARM Cortex-M4. Compared to the original proposal, the memory overhead is $2\times$ the biggest layer of the network, while the time overhead varies from $4\%$ to $0.49\%$ for a layer with $100$ and $1000$ neurons, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enabling Low-Cost Secure Computing on Untrusted In-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern computing systems are limited in performance by the memory bandwidth available to processors, a problem known as the memory wall. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) promises to substantially improve this problem by moving processing closer to the data, improving effective data bandwidth, and leading to superior performance on memory-intensive workloads. However, integrating PIM modules within a secure computing system raises an interesting challenge: unencrypted data has to move off-chip to the PIM, exposing the data to attackers and breaking assumptions on Trusted Computing Bases (TCBs). To tackle this challenge, this paper leverages multi-party computation (MPC) techniques, specifically arithmetic secret sharing and Yao's garbled circuits, to outsource bandwidth-intensive computation securely to PIM. Additionally, we leverage precomputation optimization to prevent the CPU's portion of the MPC from becoming a bottleneck. We evaluate our approach using the UPMEM PIM system over various applications such as Deep Learning Recommendation Model inference and Logistic Regression. Our evaluations demonstrate up to a $14.66\times$ speedup compared to a secure CPU configuration while maintaining data confidentiality and integrity when outsourcing linear and/or nonlinear computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been widely used in 3D reconstruction and 3D generation. Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Functions of Private Statistics in Postprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a differentially private unbiased estimate $\tilde{q}=q(D) +\nu$ of a statistic $q(D)$, we wish to obtain unbiased estimates of functions of $q(D)$, such as $1/q(D)$, solely through post-processing of $\tilde{q}$, with no further access to the confidential dataset $D$. To this end, we adapt the deconvolution method used for unbiased estimation in the statistical literature, deriving unbiased estimators for a broad family of twice-differentiable functions when the privacy-preserving noise $\nu$ is drawn from the Laplace distribution (Dwork et al., 2006). We further extend this technique to a more general class of functions, deriving approximately optimal estimators that are unbiased for values in a user-specified interval (possibly extending to $\pm \infty$). We use these results to derive an unbiased estimator for private means when the size $n$ of the dataset is not publicly known. In a numerical application, we find that a mechanism that uses our estimator to return an unbiased sample size and mean outperforms a mechanism that instead uses the previously known unbiased privacy mechanism for such means (Kamath et al., 2023). We also apply our estimators to develop unbiased transformation mechanisms for per-record differential privacy, a privacy concept in which the privacy guarantee is a public function of a record's value (Seeman et al., 2024). Our mechanisms provide stronger privacy guarantees than those in prior work (Finley et al., 2024) by using Laplace, rather than Gaussian, noise. Finally, using a different approach, we go beyond Laplace noise by deriving unbiased estimators for polynomials under the weak condition that the noise distribution has sufficiently many moments.</description>

      <title>Random Number Generation from Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsars exhibit signals with precise inter-arrival times that are on the order of milliseconds to seconds, depending on the individual pulsar. There are subtle variations in the timing of pulsar signals. We show that these variations can serve as a natural entropy source for the creation of Random Number Generators (RNGs). We also explore the effects of using randomness extractors to increase the entropy of random bits extracted from Pulsar timing data. To evaluate the quality of the Pulsar RNG, we model its entropy as a $k$-source and use well-known cryptographic results to show its closeness to a theoretically ideal uniformly random source. To remain consistent with prior work, we also show that the Pulsar RNG passes well-known statistical tests such as the NIST test suite.</description>

      <title>On Benchmarking Code LLMs for Android Malware Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various code intelligence tasks. However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored. Decompiled Android malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names. This paper presents CAMA, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. CAMA specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics (consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance), enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use CAMA to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.</description>

      <title>Decentralised collaborative action: cryptoeconomics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchains and peer-to-peer systems are part of a trend towards computer systems that are "radically decentralised", by which we mean that they 1) run across many participants, 2) without central control, and 3) are such that qualities 1 and 2 are essential to the system's intended use cases.
  We propose a notion of topological space, which we call a "semitopology", to help us mathematically model such systems. We treat participants as points in a space, which are organised into "actionable coalitions". An actionable coalition is any set of participants who collectively have the resources to collaborate (if they choose) to progress according to the system's rules, without involving any other participants in the system.
  It turns out that much useful information about the system can be obtained \emph{just} by viewing it as a semitopology and studying its actionable coalitions. For example: we will prove a mathematical sense in which if every actionable coalition of some point p has nonempty intersection with every actionable coalition of another point q -- note that this is the negation of the famous Hausdorff separation property from topology -- then p and q must remain in agreement.
  This is of practical interest, because remaining in agreement is a key correctness property in many distributed systems. For example in blockchain, participants disagreeing is called "forking", and blockchain designers try hard to avoid it.
  We provide an accessible introduction to: the technical context of decentralised systems; why we build them and find them useful; how they motivate the theory of semitopological spaces; and we sketch some basic theorems and applications of the resulting mathematics.</description>

      <title>vApps: Verifiable Applications at Internet Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain technology promises a decentralized, trustless, and interoperable infrastructure. However, widespread adoption remains hindered by issues such as limited scalability, high transaction costs, and the complexity of maintaining coherent verification logic across different blockchain layers. This paper introduces Verifiable Applications (vApps), a novel development framework designed to streamline the creation and deployment of verifiable blockchain computing applications. vApps offer a unified Rust-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) within a comprehensive SDK, featuring modular abstractions for verification, proof generation, and inter-chain connectivity. This eases the developer's burden in securing diverse software components, allowing them to focus on application logic. The DSL also ensures that applications can automatically take advantage of specialized precompiles and hardware acceleration to achieve consistently high performance with minimal developer effort, as demonstrated by benchmark results for zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Experiments show that native Rust execution eliminates interpretation overhead, delivering up to an 832x cycle count improvement compared to EVM-based approaches. Precompiled circuits can accelerate the proof by more than 95\%, while GPU acceleration increases throughput by up to 30x and recursion compresses the proof size by up to 230x, enabling succinct and efficient verification. The framework also supports seamless integration with the Web2 and Web3 systems, enabling developers to focus solely on their application logic. Through modular architecture, robust security guarantees, and composability, vApps pave the way toward a trust-minimized and verifiable Internet-scale application environment.</description>

      <title>aiXamine: Simplified LLM Safety and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for safety and security remains a complex task, often requiring users to navigate a fragmented landscape of ad hoc benchmarks, datasets, metrics, and reporting formats. To address this challenge, we present aiXamine, a comprehensive black-box evaluation platform for LLM safety and security. aiXamine integrates over 40 tests (i.e., benchmarks) organized into eight key services targeting specific dimensions of safety and security: adversarial robustness, code security, fairness and bias, hallucination, model and data privacy, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, over-refusal, and safety alignment. The platform aggregates the evaluation results into a single detailed report per model, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance, test examples, and rich visualizations. We used aiXamine to assess over 50 publicly available and proprietary LLMs, conducting over 2K examinations. Our findings reveal notable vulnerabilities in leading models, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks in OpenAI's GPT-4o, biased outputs in xAI's Grok-3, and privacy weaknesses in Google's Gemini 2.0. Additionally, we observe that open-source models can match or exceed proprietary models in specific services such as safety alignment, fairness and bias, and OOD robustness. Finally, we identify trade-offs between distillation strategies, model size, training methods, and architectural choices.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Sentinel: LLM Agent for Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>Automated Trustworthiness Oracle Generation for Machine Learning Text Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) for text classification has been widely used in various domains. These applications can significantly impact ethics, economics, and human behavior, raising serious concerns about trusting ML decisions. Studies indicate that conventional metrics are insufficient to build human trust in ML models. These models often learn spurious correlations and predict based on them. In the real world, their performance can deteriorate significantly. To avoid this, a common practice is to test whether predictions are reasonable based on valid patterns in the data. Along with this, a challenge known as the trustworthiness oracle problem has been introduced. Due to the lack of automated trustworthiness oracles, the assessment requires manual validation of the decision process disclosed by explanation methods. However, this is time-consuming, error-prone, and unscalable.
  We propose TOKI, the first automated trustworthiness oracle generation method for text classifiers. TOKI automatically checks whether the words contributing the most to a prediction are semantically related to the predicted class. Specifically, we leverage ML explanations to extract the decision-contributing words and measure their semantic relatedness with the class based on word embeddings. We also introduce a novel adversarial attack method that targets trustworthiness vulnerabilities identified by TOKI. To evaluate their alignment with human judgement, experiments are conducted. We compare TOKI with a naive baseline based solely on model confidence and TOKI-guided adversarial attack method with A2T, a SOTA adversarial attack method. Results show that relying on prediction uncertainty cannot effectively distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy predictions, TOKI achieves 142% higher accuracy than the naive baseline, and TOKI-guided attack method is more effective with fewer perturbations than A2T.</description>
