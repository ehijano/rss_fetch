      <title>25 Additional Problems -- Extension to the Book "125 Problems in Text Algorithms"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This very preliminary text is related to ``Algorithms on Texts'', also called ``Algorithmic Stringology''. It is an extension of the book ``125 Problems in Text Algorithms'' providing, in the same compact style, more problems with solutions. We refer also to the companions to ``Text algorithms'' available at http://monge.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/CLR/clr1-20.pdf and at the web page http://125-problems.univ-mlv.fr, where all 150 problems (including the ones presented here) are briefly announced. The selected problems satisfy three criteria: challenging, having short tricky solutions and solvable with only very basic background in stringology. For the basics in stringology we refer to http://monge.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/CLR/clr1-20.pdf.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Evaluation of $k$-of-$n$ Functions: Tight Gap and a Unit-Cost PTAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation (SBFE) problem in the well-studied case of $k$-of-$n$ functions: There are independent Boolean random variables $x_1,\dots,x_n$ where each variable $i$ has a known probability $p_i$ of taking value $1$, and a known cost $c_i$ that can be paid to find out its value. The value of the function is $1$ iff there are at least $k$ $1$s among the variables. The goal is to efficiently compute a strategy that, at minimum expected cost, tests the variables until the function value is determined. While an elegant polynomial-time exact algorithm is known when tests can be made adaptively, we focus on the non-adaptive variant, for which much less is known.
  First, we show a clean and tight lower bound of $2$ on the adaptivity gap, i.e., the worst-case multiplicative loss in the objective function caused by disallowing adaptivity, of the problem. This improves the tight lower bound of $3/2$ for the unit-cost variant.
  Second, we give a PTAS for computing the best non-adaptive strategy in the unit-cost case, the first PTAS for an SBFE problem. At the core, our scheme establishes a novel notion of two-sided dominance (w.r.t. the optimal solution) by guessing so-called milestone tests for a set of carefully chosen buckets of tests. To turn this technique into a polynomial-time algorithm, we use a decomposition approach paired with a random-shift argument.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Online Covering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a very general and simple framework to incorporate predictions on requests for online covering problems in a rigorous and black-box manner. Our framework turns any online algorithm with competitive ratio $\rho(k, \cdot)$ depending on $k$, the number of arriving requests, into an algorithm with competitive ratio of $\rho(\eta, \cdot)$, where $\eta$ is the prediction error. With accurate enough prediction, the resulting competitive ratio breaks through the corresponding worst-case online lower bounds, and smoothly degrades as the prediction error grows. This framework directly applies to a wide range of well-studied online covering problems such as facility location, Steiner problems, set cover, parking permit, etc., and yields improved and novel bounds.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Algorithm for Shortest Paths in Unweighted Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given in the plane a set $S$ of $n$ points and a set of disks centered at these points, the disk graph $G(S)$ induced by these disks has vertex set $S$ and an edge between two vertices if their disks intersect. Note that the disks may have different radii. We consider the problem of computing shortest paths from a source point $s\in S$ to all vertices in $G(S)$ where the length of a path in $G(S)$ is defined as the number of edges in the path. The previously best algorithm solves the problem in $O(n\log^2 n)$ time. A lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$ is also known for this problem under the algebraic decision tree model. In this paper, we present an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm, which matches the lower bound and thus is optimal. Another virtue of our algorithm is that it is quite simple.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Restless Temporal Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bumpus and Meeks introduced a purely temporal parameter, called vertex-interval-membership-width, which is promising for the design of fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for vertex reachability problems in temporal graphs. We study this newly introduced parameter for the problem of restless temporal paths, in which the waiting time at each node is restricted. In this article, we prove that, in the interval model, where arcs are present for entire time intervals, finding a restless temporal path is NP-hard even if the vertex-interval-membership-width is equal to three. We exhibit FPT algorithms for the point model, where arcs are present at specific points in time, both with uniform delay one and arbitrary positive delays. In the latter case, this comes with a slight additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Formal Refutation of the Blockchain Trilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called blockchain trilemma asserts the impossibility of simultaneously achieving scalability, security, and decentralisation within a single blockchain protocol. In this paper, we formally refute that proposition. Employing predicate logic, formal automata theory, computational complexity analysis, and graph-theoretic measures of relay topology--specifically Baran's model of network path redundancy--we demonstrate that the trilemma constitutes a category error, conflates distinct analytical domains, and relies upon unproven causal assumptions. We further expose its reliance on composition fallacies drawn from flawed system implementations. A constructive counterexample is presented: a blockchain protocol exhibiting unbounded transaction throughput, cryptographic security under adversarial load, and multipath decentralised propagation. This example is not hypothetical but grounded in protocol design enabled by compact block relay, SPV verification, and IPv6 multicast. The trilemma is revealed not as a law of protocol architecture, but as a heuristic fallacy sustained by imprecision and design defeatism.</description>

      <title>Instance-Optimal Quantum State Certification with Entangled Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22], they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method, which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15], i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple proof.</description>

      <title>An algorithm with a delay of $\mathcal{O}(k\Delta)$ for enumerating connected induced subgraphs of size $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of enumerating connected subgraphs of a given size in a graph has been extensively studied in recent years. In this paper, we propose an algorithm with a delay of $O(k\Delta)$ for enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of size $k$ in an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $k$ and $\Delta$ are respectively the size of subgraphs and the maximum degree of $G$. The algorithm requires a preprocessing step of $O(|V| + |E|)$ time to compute a depth-first search traversal order. The proposed algorithm improves upon the current best delay bound $O(k^2\Delta)$ for the connected induced subgraph enumeration problem in the literature.</description>

      <title>Semi-Streaming Algorithms for Hypergraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two one-pass streaming algorithms for the $\mathcal{NP}$-hard hypergraph matching problem. The first algorithm stores a small subset of potential matching edges in a stack using dual variables to select edges. It has an approximation guarantee of $\frac{1}{d(1+\varepsilon)}$ and requires $\mathcal{O}((\frac{n}{\varepsilon}) \log^2{n})$ bits of memory, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the hypergraph, $d$ is the maximum number of vertices in a hyperedge, and $\epsilon &gt; 0$ is a parameter to be chosen. The second algorithm computes, stores, and updates a single matching as the edges stream, with an approximation ratio dependent on a parameter $\alpha$. Its best approximation guarantee is $\frac{1}{(2d-1) + 2 \sqrt{d(d-1)}}$, and it requires only $\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory.
  We have implemented both algorithms and compared them with respect to solution quality, memory consumption, and running times on two diverse sets of hypergraphs with a non-streaming greedy and a naive streaming algorithm. Our results show that the streaming algorithms achieve much better solution quality than naive algorithms when facing adverse orderings. Furthermore, these algorithms reduce the memory required by a factor of 13 in the geometric mean on our test problems, and also outperform the offline Greedy algorithm in running time.</description>

      <title>Testing whether a subgraph is convex or isometric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following two algorithmic problems: given a graph $G$ and a subgraph $H\subseteq G$, decide whether $H$ is an isometric or a geodesically convex subgraph of $G$. It is relatively easy to see that the problems can be solved by computing the distances between all pairs of vertices. We provide a conditional lower bound showing that, for sparse graphs with $n$ vertices and $\Theta(n)$ edges, we cannot expect to solve the problem in $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ time for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We also show that the problem can be solved in subquadratic time for planar graphs and in near-linear time for graphs of bounded treewidth. Finally, we provide a near-linear time algorithm for the setting where $G$ is a plane graph and $H$ is defined by a few cycles in $G$.</description>

      <title>Tight Guarantees for Cut-Relative Survivable Network Design via a Decomposition Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical \emph{survivable-network-design problem} (SNDP), we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, non-negative edge costs, and some $(s_i,t_i,r_i)$ tuples, where $s_i,t_i\in V$ and $r_i\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. We seek a minimum-cost subset $H \subseteq E$ such that each $s_i$-$t_i$ pair remains connected even if any $r_i-1$ edges fail. It is well-known that SNDP can be equivalently modeled using a weakly-supermodular \emph{cut-requirement function} $f$, where we seek a minimum-cost edge-set containing at least $f(S)$ edges across every cut $S \subseteq V$.
  Recently, Dinitz et al. proposed a variant of SNDP that enforces a \emph{relative} level of fault tolerance with respect to $G$, where the goal is to find a solution $H$ that is at least as fault-tolerant as $G$ itself. They formalize this in terms of paths and fault-sets, which gives rise to \emph{path-relative SNDP}. Along these lines, we introduce a new model of relative network design, called \emph{cut-relative SNDP} (CR-SNDP), where the goal is to select a minimum-cost subset of edges that satisfies the given (weakly-supermodular) cut-requirement function to the maximum extent possible, i.e., by picking $\min\{f(S),|\delta_G(S)|\}$ edges across every cut $S\subseteq V$.
  Unlike SNDP, the cut-relative and path-relative versions of SNDP are not equivalent. The resulting cut-requirement function for CR-SNDP (as also path-relative SNDP) is not weakly supermodular, and extreme-point solutions to the natural LP-relaxation need not correspond to a laminar family of tight cut constraints. Consequently, standard techniques cannot be used directly to design approximation algorithms for this problem. We develop a \emph{novel decomposition technique} to circumvent this difficulty and use it to give a \emph{tight $2$-approximation algorithm for CR-SNDP}. We also show new hardness results for these relative-SNDP problems.</description>

      <title>Greedy Dynamic Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a foundational model of dynamic matching market with abandonment. This model has been studied by Collina et al (2020) and Aouad and Saritac (2022), and many other papers have considered special cases. We compare the performance of greedy policies -- which identify a set of "acceptable" matches up front, and perform these matches as soon as possible -- to that of an omniscient benchmark which knows the full arrival and departure sequence.
  We use a novel family of linear programs ($LP^{ALG}$) to identify which greedy policy to follow. We show that the value of $LP^{ALG}$ is a *lower bound* on the value of the greedy policy that it identifies in two settings of interest:
  -When all types have the same departure rate.
  -The bipartite case where types on the same side of the market have the same departure rate.
  The proofs of these results use a new result (Lemma 1), which relates the *probability* that at least one agent from a set of types is present in the system to the expected number of such agents.
  We also show that the value of $LP^{ALG}$ is at least 1/2 of the reward rate earned by the omniscient policy (Proposition 4). Therefore, for both settings above, our greedy policy provably earns at least half of the omniscient reward rate. This improves upon the bound of 1/8 from Collina (2020). In both settings our competitive ratio of 1/2 is the best possible: no online policy can provide a better guarantee (Theorem 2).
  To show these results we introduce a new linear program that upper bounds the objective value of the omniscient policy (Proposition 3). This improves upon the upper bounds presented by Collina et al (2020) and Kessel et al (2022).</description>

      <title>Quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs, and more particularly in the unidirectional model, where the algorithm is allowed to query only the outgoing edges of a vertex. In the classical unidirectional model, the problem of testing $k$-star-freeness, and more generally $k$-source-subgraph-freeness, is almost maximally hard for large $k$. We prove that this problem has almost quadratic advantage in the quantum setting. Moreover, we show that this advantage is nearly tight, by showing a quantum lower bound using the method of dual polynomials on an intermediate problem for a new, property testing version of the $k$-collision problem that was not studied before.
  To illustrate that not all problems in graph property testing admit such a quantum speedup, we consider the problem of $3$-colorability in the related undirected bounded-degree model, when graphs are now undirected. This problem is maximally hard to test classically, and we show that also quantumly it requires a linear number of queries.</description>

      <title>Verification of Hamiltonian Path Conjecture (BHR Conjecture) for Integers up to p=31 based on one random multiset per FP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BHR (Buratti-Horak-Rosa) Conjecture (2006) proposes that for every p and a multiset L of (p-1) positive integers modulo p, there exists a Hamiltonian path in the Complete Graph Kp with consecutive edge lengths given by the elements of L. In this article, we outline an approach to the conjecture based on frequency partitions and local/global adjustment operations and backtracking. We describe the mathematical strategy, experimental evidence, and implementation in a Python Program to explore valid Hamiltonian paths p &lt; 37. This is a result an improvement over by Mariusz Meszka for all primes up to 23 (included) with the aid of a computer.</description>
