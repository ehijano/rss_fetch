      <title>Debunking the Myth of Join Ordering: Toward Robust SQL Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Join order optimization is critical in achieving good query performance. Despite decades of research and practice, modern query optimizers could still generate inferior join plans that are orders of magnitude slower than optimal. Existing research on robust query processing often lacks theoretical guarantees on join-order robustness while sacrificing query performance. In this paper, we rediscover the recent Predicate Transfer technique from a robustness point of view. We introduce two new algorithms, LargestRoot and SafeSubjoin, and then propose Robust Predicate Transfer (RPT) that is provably robust against arbitrary join orders of an acyclic query. We integrated Robust Predicate Transfer with DuckDB, a state-of-the-art analytical database, and evaluated against all the queries in TPC-H, JOB, and TPC-DS benchmarks. Our experimental results show that RPT improves join-order robustness by orders of magnitude compared to the baseline. With RPT, the largest ratio between the maximum and minimum execution time out of random join orders for a single acyclic query is only 1.6x (the ratio is close to 1 for most evaluated queries). Meanwhile, applying RPT also improves the end-to-end query performance by 1.5x (per-query geometric mean). We hope that this work sheds light on solving the practical join ordering problem.</description>

      <title>LEDD: Large Language Model-Empowered Data Discovery in Data Lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data discovery in data lakes with ever increasing datasets has long been recognized as a big challenge in the realm of data management, especially for semantic search of and hierarchical global catalog generation of tables. While large language models (LLMs) facilitate the processing of data semantics, challenges remain in architecting an end-to-end system that comprehensively exploits LLMs for the two semantics-related tasks. In this demo, we propose LEDD, an end-to-end system with an extensible architecture that leverages LLMs to provide hierarchical global catalogs with semantic meanings and semantic table search for data lakes. Specifically, LEDD can return semantically related tables based on natural-language specification. These features make LEDD an ideal foundation for downstream tasks such as model training and schema linking for text-to-SQL tasks. LEDD also provides a simple Python interface to facilitate the extension and the replacement of data discovery algorithms.</description>

      <title>Model Lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of deep learning models, it can be hard to find models appropriate to a task, understand the models, and characterize how models are different one from another. Currently, practitioners rely on manually-written documentation to understand and choose models. However, not all models have complete and reliable documentation. As the number of models increases, the challenges of finding, differentiating, and understanding models become increasingly crucial. Inspired from research on data lakes, we introduce the concept of model lakes. We formalize key model lake tasks, including model attribution, versioning, search, and benchmarking, and discuss fundamental research challenges in the management of large models. We also explore what data management techniques can be brought to bear on the study of large model management.</description>

      <title>A large-scale multicenter breast cancer DCE-MRI benchmark dataset with expert segmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in breast cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) faces challenges due to limited expert-labeled segmentations. To address this, we present a multicenter dataset of 1506 pre-treatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI cases, including expert annotations of primary tumors and non-mass-enhanced regions. The dataset integrates imaging data from four collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), where only 163 cases with expert segmentations were initially available. To facilitate the annotation process, a deep learning model was trained to produce preliminary segmentations for the remaining cases. These were subsequently corrected and verified by 16 breast cancer experts (averaging 9 years of experience), creating a fully annotated dataset. Additionally, the dataset includes 49 harmonized clinical and demographic variables, as well as pre-trained weights for a baseline nnU-Net model trained on the annotated data. This resource addresses a critical gap in publicly available breast cancer datasets, enabling the development, validation, and benchmarking of advanced deep learning models, thus driving progress in breast cancer diagnostics, treatment response prediction, and personalized care.</description>
