      <title>BROWDIE: a New Machine Learning Model for Searching T&amp;Y Dwarfs Using the UKIDSS J, H, K Band Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new T, Y dwarf search model using machine learning (ML), called the "BROWn Dwarf Image Explorer (BROWDIE). Brown dwarfs (BD) are estimated to make up 25 percent of all celestial objects in the Galaxy, yet only a small number have been thoroughly studied. Homogeneous and complete samples of BDs are essential to advance the studies. However, due to their faintness, conducting spectral studies of BDs can be challenging. T\&amp;Y brown dwarfs, a redder and fainter subclass of BDs, are even harder to detect. As a result, only a few T\&amp;Y dwarfs have been extensively studied. Numerous attempts, including ML using various color band observations, have been made to identify BDs based on their colors. However, those models often require a large number of color observations, which can be a limitation. This study implemented an ML model by utilizing data from the J, H, and K photometry of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Surveys (UKIDSS) simultaneously, effectively distinguishing celestial objects similar to BDs. The BROWDIE model was trained using UKIDSS data, and based on the model, 118 T dwarfs and 14 Y dwarfs were found in the UKIDSS DR11PLUS LAS L4 zone.</description>

      <title>High Mass Inner Regions Found in Five Outbursting Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young stellar objects are thought to commonly undergo sudden accretion events that result in a rise in bolometric luminosity. These outbursts likely coincide with the onset of planet formation, and could impact the formation of planets. The reason behind this dramatic enhancement of accretion is an active area of research, and the mass of the system is a critical parameter. Using Northern Extended Millimeter Array, we survey five outbursting sources (three FU Ori, one EX Or, one 'peculiar' source) with the primary goal of determining the system's mass using an optically thin line of CO. We estimate the mass of a central region for each object that using both continuum emission and C17O J=2-1. The C17O emission likely includes both disk and inner envelope material, thus acts as an upper limit on the disk mass, ranging from 0.33-3.4 Msun for our sources. These derived masses suggest that the inner approx. 1000 au contains enough mass along the line of sight for these sources to be gravitationally unstable.</description>

      <title>Complex Organics Surrounding the FU Ori-Type Object V1057 Cyg Indicative of Sublimated Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FU Ori and EX Lup type objects present natural experiments for understanding a critical stage in the star and planet formation process. These objects offer insight into the diversity of molecules available to forming planetary systems due to a sudden increase in accretion and central luminosity causes the disk and surrounding material to increase in temperature. This allows for volatiles to sublimate off of grains and exist in the gas-phase for tens to hundreds of years post initial outburst. While this dynamic stage may be common for solar-type protostars, observations of the chemical impact of these bursts are rare. In this article, we present observations from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) of five Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that have undergone outbursts within the past 100 years and catalog the volatile chemistry found within approx 1000 au of the YSO. Only one source clearly shows a line rich spectra with &gt;11 molecules detected including complex organics and water, as is an expected spectra signature for a post-outburst source. This source is V1057 Cyg, and we present it as the northern analog to the well studied and molecule-rich FU Ori source, V883 Ori. Our conclusions on the chemical inventory of the other four sources in our sample are sensitivity limited, as V1057 Cyg contains the highest disk/envelope gas mass.</description>

      <title>The HST Large Programme on Omega Centauri -- VII. The white dwarf cooling sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS) in the globular cluster (GC) Omega Centauri, the primary goal of a dedicated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) programme. Our analysis has revealed that the peak at the termination of the WD CS is located at $m_{\rm F606W}$=30.1$\pm$0.2 (equivalent to $V$$\sim$31). The brighter part of Omega Centauri's WD CS is consistent with the presence of massive He-core WDs, in agreement with previous HST analyses with ultraviolet and blue filters. Comparative analyses of the WD luminosity function (LF) with theoretical counterparts have shown that a single-age population for the cluster is compatible with the data. However, an analysis of just the WD LF cannot entirely exclude the possibility of an age range, due to uncertainties in the present-day WD mass function, with a star formation history potentially spanning up to 5 billion years, predominantly comprising stars about 13 Gyr old, and with just a minority potentially as young as 8 Gyr. This underscores the need for global spectroscopic and photometric investigations that include simultaneously the WD populations together with the previous evolutionary phases to fully understand the cluster's diverse chemical compositions and ages.</description>

      <title>Solar energetic particles injected inside and outside a magnetic cloud: The widespread solar energetic particle event on 2022 January 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. On 2022 January 20, the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) on board Solar Orbiter measured a solar energetic particle (SEP) event showing unusual first arriving particles from the anti-Sun direction. Near-Earth spacecraft separated 17{\deg} in longitude to the west from Solar Orbiter measured classic antisunward-directed fluxes. STEREO-A and MAVEN, separated 18{\deg} to the east and 143{\deg} to the west from Solar Orbiter respectively, also observed the event, suggesting that particles spread over at least 160{\deg} in the heliosphere.
  Results. Solar Orbiter was embedded in a MC erupting on 16 January from the same active region as the one related to the SEP event on 20 January. The SEP event is related to a M5.5 flare and a fast CME-driven shock of 1433 km/s, which injected particles within and outside the MC. The hard SEP spectra, the presence of a Type II radio burst, and the co-temporal Type III radio bursts being observed from 80 MHz that seems to emanate from the Type II, points to the shock as the relevant accelerator of the particles.
  Conclusions. The detailed analysis of the SEP event strongly suggest that the energetic particles are injected mainly by a CME-driven shock into and outside of a previous MC present in the heliosphere at the time of the particle onset. The sunward propagating SEPs measured by Solar Orbiter are produced by the injection of particles along the longer (western) leg of the MC still connected to the Sun at the time of the release of the particles. The determined electron propagation path length inside the MC is around 30% longer than the estimated length of the loop leg of the MC itself (based on the graduated cylindrical shell model) consistent with a low number of field line rotations.</description>

      <title>Tracing Field Lines That Are Reconnecting or Expanding or Both</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explosive energy release in the solar atmosphere is driven magnetically, but mechanisms triggering the onset of the eruption remain in debate. In the case of flares and CMEs, ideal or non-ideal instabilities usually occur in the corona, but direct observations and diagnostics there are difficult to obtain. To overcome this difficulty, we analyze observational signatures in the upper chromosphere or transition region, in particular, brightenings and dimmings at the feet of coronal magnetic structures. In this paper, we examine the time evolution of spatially resolved light curves in two eruptive flares, and identify a variety of tempo-spatial sequences of brightenings and dimmings, such as dimming followed by brightening, and dimming preceded by brightening. These brightening-dimming sequences are indicative of the configuration of energy release in the form of plasma heating or bulk motion. We demonstrate the potential of using these analyses to diagnose properties of magnetic reconnection and plasma expansion in the corona during the early stage of the eruption.</description>

      <title>Post-Outburst Chemistry in a Very Low-Luminosity Object: Peculiar High Abundance of Nitric Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abridged: Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are deeply embedded, and extremely faint objects and are thought to be in the quiescent phase of the episodic accretion process. They fill an important gap in our understanding of star formation. The VeLLO in the isolated DC3272+18 cloud has undergone an outburst, and is thus an ideal target for investigating the chemical inventory in the gas phase of an object of its type. Observations with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) in four spectral windows in the frequency range of 213.6--272.4~GHz have been carried out to identify molecules that can be directly linked to the past outburst, utilize the line fluxes, column densities, and the abundance ratios of the detected species to characterize the different physical components of the VeLLO, and probe for the presence of complex organic molecules. Nitric oxide (NO) is detected for the first time in a source of this type, and its formation could be induced by the sublimation of grain-surface species during the outburst. A pathway to form NO directly in the gas phase is from the photodissociation products created after the sublimation of H$_2$O and NH$_3$ from the ices. While the present time water snowline has likely retreated to pre-outburst small radius, the volatile NO species is still extensively present in the gas phase, as evident by its high column density relative to methanol in the observations. This suggests that NO could be potentially used to trace the water snowline in outbursting sources. In order to rule out non-thermal desorption processes that could also have led to the formation of NO, this proposition has to be verified with future observations at higher spatial resolution, and by searching for NO in additional targets.</description>

      <title>Identifying Uncertainties in Stellar Evolution Models Using the Open Cluster M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar age estimates are often calculated by interpolating a star's properties in a grid of models. However, different model grids will give different ages for the same star. We used the open cluster M67 to compare four different model grids: DSEP, GARSTEC, MIST, and YREC. Across all model grids, age estimates for main sequence stars were consistently higher than the accepted age of M67, while age estimates for red giant stars were lower. We compared model-generated age and mass values to external constraints as an additional test of the reliability of each model grid. For stars near solar age and metallicity, we recommend using the DSEP model grid to estimate the ages of main sequence stars and the GARSTEC model grid for red giant stars.</description>

      <title>Identification of a turnover in the initial mass function of a young stellar cluster down to 0.5 M$_{J}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M$_{J}$. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be 2-10 M$_{J}$. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. Here we present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M$_{J}$ within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 {\mu}m, we identified several free floating objects down to ~ 3 M$_{J}$ with sensitivity to 0.5 M$_{J}$. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M$_{J}$ to roughly 12 M$_{J}$, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M$_{J}$. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M$_{J}$.</description>

      <title>Hot Stars in the GALEX Ultraviolet Sky Surveys (GUVcat_AISxSDSS_HS) and the Binary Fraction of Hot Evolved Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 71,364 point-like UV sources with SDSS photometry and GALEX FUV-NUV less or equal 0.1mag. The limit corresponds to stellar Teff greater than 15,000 to 20,000K, slightly depending on gravity but nearly reddening-independent for Milky-Way-type dust. Most sources are hot white-dwarfs (WDs) and sub-dwarfs (SDs). Comparing the SED (GALEX FUV, NUV, SDSS u,g,r,i,z) of 35,294 sources having good photometry with colors of stellar models and known objects, we identify 12,404+1871-1267 binary hot-compact stars with a cooler, less-evolved companion (with a possible 8% to 15% contamination by low-redshift QSOs), and 22,848+1267-3853 single-star candidates. Single-star counts are an upper limit because pairs of similar stars have single-star-like SED, and hot-WDs with main-sequence companions of certain types (depending on WD's radius) are missed or counted as single in the available wavelength range and selection. The catalog offers unique leverage for identifying hot WDs, elusive at longer wavelengths when a cooler, larger companion dominates optical-IR fluxes: 51% of the binary- and 20% of the single-star candidates are previously un-known objects. Gaia DR3 provides a parallax with error less than 20% for 34% of the binaries- and 45% of single-star candidates, allowing Teff, E(B-V), radius and Lbol to be derived from SED analysis. The binary-candidate sample usefully expands the overall current binary-WD census to subpopulations elusive to Gaia and to other searches. The binary fraction among this specific sample of hot-compact objects, albeit with the mentioned biases, B_f&gt;46%, compared with that of their progenitors (&gt;80%-50% for mass range 8-1Msun, Moe (2019)), implies a lower merging rate than found for massive stars by Sana et al (2017).</description>

      <title>First joint X-ray solar microflare observations with NuSTAR and Solar Orbiter/STIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first joint spectral and imaging analysis of hard X-ray (HXR) emission from 3 microflares observed by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) and Solar Orbiter/Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX). We studied 5 joint spectra from GOES A7, B1 and B6 class microflares from active region AR12765 on 2020 June 6 and 7. As these events are very bright for NuSTAR, resulting in extremely low (&lt;1%) livetime, we introduce a pile-up correction method. All five joint spectra were fitted with an isothermal model finding temperatures in the 9-11 MK range. Furthermore, three joint spectra required an additional non-thermal thick-target model finding non-thermal powers of $10^{25}$-$10^{26}$ erg s$^{-1}$. All the fit parameters were within the ranges expected for HXR microflares. The fit results give a relative scaling of STIX and NuSTAR mostly between 6-28% (one outlier at 52%) suggesting each instrument are well calibrated. In addition to spectral analysis, we performed joint HXR imaging of the June 6 and one of the June 7 microflares. In NuSTAR's field of view (FOV), we observed two separate non-thermal sources connected by an elongated thermal source during the June 6 microflares. In STIX's FOV (44 degrees W with respect to NuSTAR), we imaged thermal emission from the hot flare loops which when reprojected to an Earth viewpoint matches the thermal sources seen with NuSTAR and in the hotter EUV channels with the Solar Dynamic Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a catalog of the energy distribution in the spectra of 263 stars in the wavelength range from 0.4 to 100 {\mu}m, which are at late stages of evolution and have been observed by the ISO space observatory. For each object in the catalog, estimates of the observed bolometric fluxes were derived from smoothed energy distribution curves. The catalog is available at https://infra.sai.msu.ru/sai\_lss\_sed both as a table and in machine-readable format. It is shown that for the specified sample of objects their ISO SWS spectra in the range 2.4-45 {\mu}m only 60% of cases correspond to the general shape of the continuum, and can be used without recalibration. A selection of carbon stars, accessible for the infrared observations from the MSU observatories has been made. For some of them the first brightness estimates in the K, L, and M bands were obtained with the new IR camera of the 2.5-m telescope of CMO.</description>

      <title>Pulsating stars in Local Group dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularity of pulsating stars resides in their capacity of determining several crucial and relevant parameters such as heliocentric distances, ages, metallicity gradients and reddening. RR Lyrae stars are old stellar tracers and have been detected in nearly all nearby galaxies that have been searched for these stars, with just a few exceptions of very low mass dwarfs. Less common but also of great importance are Anomalous Cepheids, indicators of either old or intermediate-age population, depending on their stellar origin. Classical Cepheids are only found within young stellar populations, and because of their brighter absolute magnitudes, they can be detected in galaxies farther than the Local Group. This paper presents a concise review built upon the aforementioned pulsating stars in Local Group dwarf galaxies and some of their applications to infer important properties of their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Exploring spectropolarimetric inversions using neural fields. Solar chromospheric magnetic field under the weak-field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-Stokes polarimetric datasets, originating from slit-spectrograph or narrow-band filtergrams, are routinely acquired nowadays. The data rate is increasing with the advent of bi-dimensional spectropolarimeters and observing techniques that allow long-time sequences of high-quality observations. There is a clear need to go beyond the traditional pixel-by-pixel strategy in spectropolarimetric inversions by exploiting the spatiotemporal coherence of the inferred physical quantities. We explore the potential of neural networks as a continuous representation of the physical quantities over time and space (also known as neural fields), for spectropolarimetric inversions. We have implemented and tested a neural field to perform the inference of the magnetic field vector (approach also known as physics-informed neural networks) under the weak-field approximation (WFA). By using a neural field to describe the magnetic field vector, we can regularize the solution in the spatial and temporal domain by assuming that the physical quantities are continuous functions of the coordinates. We investigated the results in synthetic and real observations of the Ca II 8542 A line. We also explored the impact of other explicit regularizations, such as using the information of an extrapolated magnetic field, or the orientation of the chromospheric fibrils. Compared to the traditional pixel-by-pixel inversion, the neural field approach improves the fidelity of the reconstruction of the magnetic field vector, especially the transverse component. This implicit regularization is a way of increasing the effective signal-to-noise of the observations. Although it is slower than the pixel-wise WFA estimation, this approach shows a promising potential for depth-stratified inversions, by reducing the number of free parameters and inducing spatio-temporal constraints in the solution.</description>

      <title>True Unicorns and False Positives: Simulated Probabilities of Dark Massive Companions to Bright Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) exist in binaries. These binaries are normally discovered through their interactions, either from accretion as an X-ray binary or collisions as a gravitational wave source. However, the majority of compact objects in binaries should be non-interacting. Recently proposed discoveries have used radial velocities of a bright star (main sequence or evolved) that are indicative of a massive but dark companion, which is inferred to be a compact object. Unfortunately, this burgeoning new field has been hindered by false positives, including the ``Unicorn'' (V723 Mon) which was initially believed to be a red giant/black hole binary before being refuted. In this work, we investigate the evolution of stellar binary populations over time, using the binary evolution code COSMIC to simulate binary populations and determine the probability of a candidate object being either a ``true Unicorn'' (actual compact objects in binaries) or a false positive. We find that main sequence stars have a higher true Unicorn probability than red giants or naked helium stars (an exposed core of an evolved star), particularly if the companion is more massive and is &gt;3 times less luminous than the MS star. We also find that a top-heavy initial mass function raises the true Unicorn probability further, that super-solar metallicity reduces the probability, and that most true Unicorns are found at periods &lt;100 days. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of true Unicorns do not evolve into x-ray binaries during the age of the universe.</description>

      <title>Full Stokes-vector inversion of the solar Mg II h &amp; k lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of the Mg II h &amp; k resonance lines is the result of the joint action of scattering processes and the magnetic field induced Hanle, Zeeman, and magneto-optical effects, thus holding significant potential for the diagnostic of the magnetic field in the solar chromosphere. The Chromospheric LAyer Spectro-Polarimeter sounding rocket experiment, carried out in 2019, successfully measured at each position along the 196 arcsec spectrograph slit the wavelength variation of the four Stokes parameters in the spectral region of this doublet around 280 nm, both in an active region plage and in a quiet region close to the limb. We consider some of these CLASP2 Stokes profiles and apply to them the recently-developed HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code, which assumes a one-dimensional model atmosphere for each spatial pixel under consideration (i.e., it neglects the effects of horizontal radiative transfer). We find that the non-magnetic causes of symmetry breaking, due to the horizontal inhomogeneities and the gradients of the horizontal components of the macroscopic velocity in the solar atmosphere, have a significant impact on the linear polarization profiles. By introducing such non-magnetic causes of symmetry breaking as parameters in our inversion code, we can successfully fit the Stokes profiles and provide an estimation of the magnetic field vector. For example, in the quiet region pixels, where no circular polarization signal is detected, we find that the magnetic field strength in the upper chromosphere varies between 1 and 20 gauss.</description>

      <title>Matching seismic masses for RR Lyrae-type and oscillating red horizontal-branch stars in M4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters offer a powerful way to test the properties of stellar populations and the late stages of low-mass stellar evolution. In this paper we study oscillating giant stars and overtone RR Lyrae-type pulsators in the nearest globular cluster, M4, with the help of high-precision, continuous light curves collected by the Kepler space telescope in the K2 mission. We determine the frequency composition of five RRc stars and model their physical parameters with a grid of linear pulsation models. We are able, for the first time, to compare seismic masses of RR Lyrae stars directly to the masses of the very similar red horizontal branch stars in the same stellar population, independently determined from asteroseismic scaling relations. We find a close match, with an average seismic mass of $0.651\pm0.028\,M_\odot$ for RR Lyrae stars and $0.657\pm0.034\,M_\odot$ for red horizontal-branch stars. While the validity of our RR Lyrae masses still relies on the similarity of neighboring horizontal branch subgroups, this result strongly indicates that RRc stars may indeed exhibit high-degree, $l = 8$ and 9 non-radial modes, and modeling these modes can provide realistic mass estimates. We also determine the He content of the cluster to be $Y = 0.266\pm 0.008$, and compare the seismic masses for our sample of RR Lyrae to theoretical mass relations and highlight the limitations of these relations.</description>

      <title>Advancing Machine Learning for Stellar Activity and Exoplanet Period Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applied machine learning models to estimate stellar rotation periods from corrected light curve data obtained by the NASA Kepler mission. Traditional methods often struggle to estimate rotation periods accurately due to noise and variability in the light curve data. The workflow involved using initial period estimates from the LS-Periodogram and Transit Least Squares techniques, followed by splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. We employed several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting, and also utilized a Voting Ensemble approach to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
  The analysis included data from multiple Kepler IDs, providing detailed metrics on orbital periods and planet radii. Performance evaluation showed that the Voting Ensemble model yielded the most accurate results, with an RMSE approximately 50\% lower than the Decision Tree model and 17\% better than the K-Nearest Neighbors model. The Random Forest model performed comparably to the Voting Ensemble, indicating high accuracy. In contrast, the Gradient Boosting model exhibited a worse RMSE compared to the other approaches. Comparisons of the predicted rotation periods to the photometric reference periods showed close alignment, suggesting the machine learning models achieved high prediction accuracy. The results indicate that machine learning, particularly ensemble methods, can effectively solve the problem of accurately estimating stellar rotation periods, with significant implications for advancing the study of exoplanets and stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Suggested magnetic braking prescription derived from field complexity fails to reproduce the cataclysmic variable orbital period gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic wind braking drives the spin-down of low-mass stars and the evolution of most interacting binary stars. A magnetic braking prescription that was claimed to reproduce both the period distribution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and the evolution of the rotation rates of low-mass stars is based on a relation between the angular momentum loss rate and magnetic field complexity. The magnetic braking model based on field complexity has been claimed to predict a detached phase that could explain the observed period gap in the period distribution of CVs but has never been tested in detailed models of CV evolution. Here we fill this gap. We incorporated the suggested magnetic braking law in MESA and simulated the evolution of CVs for different initial stellar masses and initial orbital periods. We find that the prescription for magnetic braking based on field complexity fails to reproduce observations of CVs. The predicted secondary star radii are smaller than measured, and an extended detached phase that is required to explain the observed period gap (a dearth of non-magnetic CVs with periods between ${\sim}2$ and ${\sim}3$ hours) is not predicted. Proposed magnetic braking prescriptions based on a relation between the angular momentum loss rate and field complexity are too weak to reproduce the bloating of donor stars in CVs derived from observations and, in contrast to previous claims, do not provide an explanation for the observed period gap. The suggested steep decrease in the angular momentum loss rate does not lead to detachment. Stronger magnetic braking prescriptions and a discontinuity at the fully convective boundary are needed to explain the evolution of close binary stars that contain compact objects. The tension between braking laws derived from the spin-down of single stars and those required to explain CVs and other close binaries containing compact objects remains.</description>

      <title>Connectivity between the solar photosphere and chromosphere in a vortical structure. Observations of multi-phase, small-scale magnetic field amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution solar observations have revealed the existence of small-scale vortices, as seen in chromospheric intensity maps and velocity diagnostics. Frequently, these vortices have been observed near magnetic flux concentrations, indicating a link between swirls and the evolution of the small-scale magnetic fields. Vortices have also been studied with magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere, revealing their complexity, dynamics, and magnetic nature. In particular, it has been proposed that a rotating magnetic field structure driven by a photospheric vortex flow at its footprint produces the chromospheric swirling plasma motion. We present a complete and comprehensive description of the time evolution of a small-scale magnetic flux concentration interacting with the intergranular vortex flow and affected by processes of intensification and weakening of its magnetic field. In addition, we study the chromospheric dynamics associated with the interaction, including the analysis of a chromospheric swirl and an impulsive chromospheric jet.</description>

      <title>Spectral Dataset of Young Type Ib Supernovae and their Time-evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to high-cadence automated surveys, we can now detect and classify supernovae (SNe) within a few days after explosion, if not earlier. Early-time spectra of young SNe directly probe the outermost layers of the ejecta, providing insights into the extent of stripping in the progenitor star and the explosion mechanism in the case of core-collapse supernovae. However, many SNe show overlapping observational characteristics at early time, complicating the early-time classification. In this paper, we focus on the study and classification of Type Ib supernovae (SNe Ib), which are a subclass of core-collapse supernovae that lack strong hydrogen lines but show helium lines in their spectra. Here we present a spectral dataset of 8 SNe Ib, chosen to have at least 3 pre-maximum spectra, which we call early spectra. Our dataset was obtained mainly by the the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and consists of a total of 82 optical photospheric spectra, including 38 early spectra. This data set increases the number of published SNe Ib with at least three early spectra by ~60%. For our classification efforts, we use early spectra in addition to spectra taken around maximum light. We also convert our spectra into SN Identification (SNID) templates and make them available to the community for easier identification of young SNe Ib. Our data set increases the number of publicly available SNID templates of early spectra of SNe Ib by ~43%. Almost half of our sample has SN types that change over time or are different from what is listed on the Transient Name Server (TNS). We discuss the implications of our dataset and our findings for current and upcoming SN surveys and their classification efforts.</description>

      <title>A new atmospheric characterization of the sub-stellar companion HR\,2562\,B with JWST/MIRI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: HR2562B is a planetary-mass companion located 0.56arcsec (19au) from its host star. It is one of a few L/T transitional objects orbiting a young star. This companion provides insight into the evolution of young objects in the L/T transition. However, its key physical properties, such as Teff and mass, remain poorly constrained, with large uncertainties (34% for Teff, 22% for log(g)) based on near-infrared observations alone. Aims: We aim to refine these uncertainties, especially for Teff (1200-1700K) and log(g) (4-5), using new MIR data from the JWST/MIRI filters (10.65, 11.40, and 15.50 microns), and better understand the companion's chemical composition and its role in the L/T transition. Methods: MIRI data were processed using reference star differential imaging, revealing HR2562B at high S/N (16) in all 3 filters. We used 2 atmospheric models, ATMO and ExoREM, to fit the SED, combining MIR and NIR datasets. Additionally, we used CMD with brown dwarfs to explore the chemical composition of HR2562B's atmosphere and compare it to another L/T transition object, VHS1256b. Results: Our analysis improved the temperature precision (Teff=1255+-15K) by 6x compared to previous estimates. We also narrowed its luminosity to -4.69+-0.01 dex. Surface gravity remains uncertain (4.4-4.8), and its mass is estimated between 8 and 18.5Mj, depending on modeling and astrometry. Sensitivity analysis revealed the ability to detect objects between 2-5Mj at 100au. Conclusions: HR2562B likely has a near cloud-free atmosphere, with the ATMO model fitting better than ExoREM. Silicate absorption features are weak, requiring further spectroscopic observations. While HR2562B and VHS1256b share similarities, they are in different evolutionary stages, making HR2562B key to understanding young objects in the L/T transition. It is likely a planetary-mass companion, suggesting a reclassification as HR2562b.</description>

      <title>Towards Hybrid Embedded Feature Selection and Classification Approach with Slim-TSF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional solar flare forecasting approaches have mostly relied on physics-based or data-driven models using solar magnetograms, treating flare predictions as a point-in-time classification problem. This approach has limitations, particularly in capturing the evolving nature of solar activity. Recognizing the limitations of traditional flare forecasting approaches, our research aims to uncover hidden relationships and the evolutionary characteristics of solar flares and their source regions. Our previously proposed Sliding Window Multivariate Time Series Forest (Slim-TSF) has shown the feasibility of usage applied on multivariate time series data. A significant aspect of this study is the comparative analysis of our updated Slim-TSF framework against the original model outcomes. Preliminary findings indicate a notable improvement, with an average increase of 5\% in both the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS). This enhancement not only underscores the effectiveness of our refined methodology but also suggests that our systematic evaluation and feature selection approach can significantly advance the predictive accuracy of solar flare forecasting models.</description>

      <title>cogsworth: A Gala of COSMIC proportions combining binary stellar evolution and galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present cogsworth, an open-source Python tool for producing self-consistent population synthesis and galactic dynamics simulations. With cogsworth one can (1) sample a population of binaries and star formation history, (2) perform rapid (binary) stellar evolution, (3) integrate orbits through the galaxy and (4) inspect the full evolutionary history of each star or compact object, as well as their positions and kinematics. We include the functionality for post-processing hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations as a basis for galactic potentials and star formation histories to better account for initial spatial stellar clustering and more complex potentials. Alternatively, several analytic models are available for both the potential and star formation history. cogsworth can transform the intrinsic simulated population to an observed population through the joint application of dust maps, bolometric correction functions and survey selection functions.
  We provide a detailed explanation of the functionality of cogsworth and demonstrate its capabilities through a series of use cases: (1) We predict the spatial distribution of compact objects and runaways in both dwarf and Milky-Way-like galaxies, (2) using a star cluster from a hydrodynamical simulation, we show how supernovae can change the orbits of stars in several ways, and (3) we predict the separation of disrupted binary stellar companions on the sky and create a synthetic Gaia colour-magnitude diagram. We also discuss some current limitations and plans for future developments. We designed cogsworth and its online documentation to provide a powerful tool for constraining binary evolution, but also a flexible and accessible resource for the entire community.</description>

      <title>Leptodermic corrections to the TOV equations and nuclear astrophysics within the effective surface approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop at the equilibrium is used to extend the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations taking into account
  the gradient terms responsible for the system surface. The parameters of the Schwarzschild metric in the spherical case are found with these surface corrections in the
  leading (zero) order of the leptodermic approximation $a/R&lt;&lt;1$, where $a$ is the NS effective-surface (ES) thickness, and $R$ is the effective NS radius. The energy
  density $\mathcal{E}$ is considered in a general form including the functions of the particle number density and of its gradient terms. The macroscopic gravitational
  potential $\Phi(\rho)$ is taken into account in the simplest form as expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density,
  up to second order, in terms of its contributions to th separation particle energy and incompressibility. Density distributions $\rho$ across the NS ES in the normal
  direction to the ES, which are derived in the simple analytical form at the same leading approximation, was used for the derivation of the modified TOV (MTOV) equations
  by accounting for their NS surface corrections. The MTOV equations are analytically solved at first order and the results are compared with the standard TOV approach of
  the zero order.</description>

      <title>Formation of twin compact stars in low-mass X-ray binaries: Implications on eccentric and isolated millisecond pulsar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are laboratories for stellar evolution, strong gravity, and ultra-dense matter. Although MSPs are thought to originate in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), approximately 27% lack a binary companion, while others are found in systems with large orbital eccentricities. Understanding how these systems form may provide insight into the internal properties of neutron stars (NSs).
  We study the formation of a twin compact star through rapid first-order phase transitions in NS cores due to mass accretion in LMXBs. We investigate whether this mechanism, possibly coupled with secondary kick effects such as neutrino or electromagnetic rocket effects, may leave an observable long-lasting imprint on the orbit.
  We simulate mass accretion in LMXBs consisting of a NS and a low-mass main sequence companion, following the evolution of the NS mass, radius, and spin until a strong phase transition is triggered. For the NS structure, we assume a multipolytrope equation-of-state that allows for a sharp phase transition from hadronic to quark matter and satisfies observational constraints.
  We find that in compact binaries with relatively short pre-Roche lobe overflow orbital periods, an accretion-induced phase transition may occur during the LMXB phase. In contrast, in systems with wider orbits, this transition may take place during the spin-down phase, forming an eccentric binary MSP. If the transition is accompanied by a secondary kick (w &gt; 20 km/s), the binary is likely to be disrupted, forming an isolated MSP or reconfigured to an ultra-wide orbit.
  Our results suggest that accretion in LMXBs provides a viable path for forming twin compact stars, potentially leaving an observable imprint on the orbit. The eccentricity distribution of binary MSPs with long (&gt; 50 d) orbital periods could provide constraints on first-order phase transitions in dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-consider the already published phenomenon: the blue shift of diffuse interstellar bands, observed in spectra of HD34078 (AE Aur) and members of the Sco OB1 association, in particular HD152233. We have analyzed 29 diffuse bands. Part of them, already proven as blue-shifted in our earlier study, are now confirmed using another instrument: this time the 6.5m Clay telescope equipped with the MIKE spectrograph. The high signal-to-noise ratio (over 600) of our spectra allowed us to reveal even small small scale {\bf displacements} of positions (both: blue and red-shifts) of diffuse bands along the considered lines of sight. In some cases the magnitude of deviation exceeds 10 km\,s$^{-1}$. Also, we prove that profiles of many diffuse bands in spectra of HD34078 suffer significant broadening. The origin of the observed phenomena is discussed.</description>

Abstract: With recent missions such as advanced space-based observatories like the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Parker Solar Probe, and ground-based telescopes like the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), the volume, velocity, and variety of data have made solar physics enter a transformative era as solar physics big data (SPBD). With the recent advancement of deep computer vision, there are new opportunities in SPBD for tackling problems that were previously unsolvable. However, there are new challenges arising due to the inherent characteristics of SPBD and deep computer vision models. This vision paper presents an overview of the different types of SPBD, explores new opportunities in applying deep computer vision to SPBD, highlights the unique challenges, and outlines several potential future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of relativistic stars made of isotropic matter within the framework of the minimal Standard Model Extension, where a bumblebee field coupled to spacetime induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. We adopt analytic equations-of-state describing either condensate dark stars or strange quark stars. We solve the structure equations numerically, and we compute the mass-to-radius relationships. The influence of the bumblebee parameter $l$ is examined in detail, and an upper bound is obtained using the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 and the strangely light HESS J1731-347 compact object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gemini South telescope is now equipped with a new high-resolution spectrograph called GHOST (the Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph). This instrument provides high-efficiency, high-resolution spectra covering 347-1060 nm in a single exposure of either one or two targets simultaneously, along with precision radial velocity spectroscopy utilizing an internal calibration source. It can operate at a spectral element resolving power of either 76000 or 56000, and can reach a SNR$\sim$5 in a 1hr exposure on a V$\sim$20.8 mag target in median site seeing, and dark skies (per resolution element). GHOST was installed on-site in June 2022, and we report performance after full integration to queue operations in November 2023, in addition to scientific results enabled by the integration observing runs. These results demonstrate the ability to observe a wide variety of bright and faint targets with high efficiency and precision. With GHOST, new avenues to explore high-resolution spectroscopy have opened up to the astronomical community. These are described, along with the planned and potential upgrades to the instrument.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical outflows treated initially as spherically symmetric often show evidence for asymmetry once seen at higher resolution. The preponderance of aspherical and multipolar planetary nebulae (PN) and pre-planetary nebulae (PPN) was evident after many observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. Binary interactions have long been thought to be essential for shaping asymmetric PN/PPN, but how? PPN are the more kinematically demanding of the two, and warrant particular focus. I address how progress from observation and theory suggests two broad classes of accretion driven PPN jets: one for wider binaries (PPN-W) where the companion is outside the outer radius of the giant and accretes via Roche lobe overflow, and the other which occurs in the later stages of common envelope evolution (CEE) for close binaries (PPN-C). The physics within these scenarios connects to progress and open questions about the role and origin of magnetic fields in the engines and in astrophysical jets more generally.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Modelling of Fast Rotators and its Opportunities for Astrophysics</title>

Abstract: Rotation matters for the life of a star. It causes a multitude of dynamical phenomena in the stellar interior during a star's evolution and its effects accumulate until the star dies. All stars rotate at some level but those born with a mass above about 1.3 times the mass of the Sun rotate rapidly during more than 90% of their nuclear lifetime. Internal rotation guides the angular momentum and chemical element transport throughout the stellar interior. These transport processes change over time as the star evolves. The cumulative effects of stellar rotation and its induced transport processes determine the helium content of the core by the time it exhausts its hydrogen isotopes. The amount of helium at that stage also guides the heavy element yields by the end of the star's life. A proper theory of stellar evolution and any realistic models for the chemical enrichment of galaxies, must be based on observational calibrations of stellar rotation and of the induced transport processes. Since a few years, asteroseismology offers such calibrations, for single and binary stars. We review the current status of asteroseismic modelling of rotating stars for different stellar mass regimes, in an accessible way for the non-expert. While doing so, we describe exciting opportunities sparked by asteroseismology for various domains in astrophysics, touching upon topics from exoplanetary science to galactic structure and evolution towards gravitational wave physics. Along the way, we provide ample sneak-previews for future 'industrialised' applications of asteroseismology to slow and rapid rotators, from exploitation of combined Kepler, TESS, PLATO, Gaia, and spectroscopy surveys. We end the review with a list of take away messages and achievements of asteroseismology, which are of relevance for many fields of astrophysics.</description>

      <title>A Model for Eruptive Mass Loss in Massive Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well-understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a locally super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with masses $10-100~M_\odot$ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to $\sim10^{-2}~M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the HR diagram between $3.5 \lesssim \log(T_\mathrm{eff}/\mathrm{K}) \lesssim 4.0$. This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses $\gtrsim20~M_\odot$ from evolving to become red supergiants, with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and therefore offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of red supergiants in that mass regime.</description>

      <title>Global-local Fourier Neural Operator for Accelerating Coronal Magnetic Field Model</title>

Abstract: Exploring the outer atmosphere of the sun has remained a significant bottleneck in astrophysics, given the intricate magnetic formations that significantly influence diverse solar events. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations allow us to model the complex interactions between the sun's plasma, magnetic fields, and the surrounding environment. However, MHD simulation is extremely time-consuming, taking days or weeks for simulation. The goal of this study is to accelerate coronal magnetic field simulation using deep learning, specifically, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). FNO has been proven to be an ideal tool for scientific computing and discovery in the literature. In this paper, we proposed a global-local Fourier Neural Operator (GL-FNO) that contains two branches of FNOs: the global FNO branch takes downsampled input to reconstruct global features while the local FNO branch takes original resolution input to capture fine details. The performance of the GLFNO is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, including FNO, U-NO, U-FNO, Vision Transformer, CNN-RNN, and CNN-LSTM, to demonstrate its accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability. Furthermore, physics analysis from domain experts is also performed to demonstrate the reliability of GL-FNO. The results demonstrate that GL-FNO not only accelerates the MHD simulation (a few seconds for prediction, more than \times 20,000 speed up) but also provides reliable prediction capabilities, thus greatly contributing to the understanding of space weather dynamics. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/Yutao-0718/GL-FNO</description>

      <title>The mean solar butterfly diagram and poloidal field generation rate at the surface of the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difference between individual solar cycles in the magnetic butterfly diagram can mostly be ascribed to the stochasticity of the emergence process. We aim to obtain the expectation value of the butterfly diagram from observations of four cycles. This allows us to further determine the generation rate of the surface radial magnetic field. We use data from Wilcox Solar Observatory to generate time-latitude diagrams spanning cycles 21 to 24 of the surface radial and toroidal magnetic fields, symmetrize them across the equator and cycle-average them. From the mean butterfly diagram and surface toroidal field we then infer the mean poloidal field generation rate at the surface of the Sun. The averaging procedure removes realization noise from individual cycles. The amount of emerging flux required to account for the evolution of the surface radial field is found to match that provided by the observed surface toroidal field and Joy's law. Cycle-averaging butterfly diagrams removes realization noise and artefacts due to imperfect scale separation, and corresponds to an ensemble average that can be interpreted in the mean-field framework. The result can then be directly compared to $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamo models. The Babcock-Leighton $\alpha$-effect is consistent with observations, a result that can be appreciated only if the observational data is averaged in some way.</description>

Abstract: Recent works have constrained the binary fraction of evolved populations of massive stars in local galaxies such as red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, but the binary fraction of yellow supergiants (YSGs) in the Hertzsprung Gap remains unconstrained. Binary evolution theory predicts that the Hertzsprung Gap is home to multiple populations of binary systems with varied evolutionary histories. In this paper, we develop a method to distinguish single YSGs from YSG plus O- or B-type main sequence binaries using optical and ultraviolet photometry, and then apply this method to identify candidate YSG binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. After constructing a set of combined stellar atmosphere models, we find that optical photometry is, given typical measurement and reddening uncertainties, sufficient to discern single YSGs from YSG+OB binaries if the OB-star is at least $\sim5$M$_{\odot}$ for T$_{\mathrm{eff,YSG}}\sim$ 4000 K, but requires a $\sim$20M$_{\odot}$ OB star for YSGs up to T$_{\mathrm{eff,YSG}}\sim$ 9000 K. For these hotter YSG temperatures, ultraviolet photometry allows binaries with OB companions as small as $\sim$7M$_{\odot}$ to be identified. We use color-color spaces developed from these models to search for evidence of excess blue or ultraviolet light in a set of $\sim$1000 YSG candidates in the Magellanic Clouds. We identify hundreds of candidate YSG binary systems and report a preliminary fraction of YSGs that show a blue/UV color excess of 20-60\%. Spectroscopic follow-up is now required to confirm the true nature of this population.</description>

      <title>NSVS 14256825: period variation and orbital stability analysis of two possible substellar companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15358</link>

Abstract: Recent period investigations of the Post-Common Envelop Binary (PCEB) NSVS 14256825 suggested that two circumbinary companions were necessary to explain the observed Eclipse Timing Variations (ETVs). Our objective was to search for the best-fitting curve of two LTTE terms in the ETV diagram, implementing a grid search optimization scheme of Keplerian (kinematic) and Newtonian (N-body) fits, alongside a dynamical stability analysis of N-body simulations. We compiled two datasets of archival photometric data covering a different timeline and updated them with new observations and with three new times of minima (TOMs) calculated from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}). A grid search optimization process was implemented and the resulted solutions, that fell within the $90\%$ confidence interval of the best-fitting curve of the ETV diagram, were tested for orbital stability using N-body simulations and the MEGNO chaos indicator. The Keplerian and Netwonian fits are in close agreement and hundreds of stable configurations were identified for both datasets reaching a lifetime of 1 Myr. Our results suggest that the ETV data can be explained by the presence of a circumbinary planet with mass $m_b=11 M_{Jup.}$ in a nearly circular inner orbit of period $P_b = 7$ yr. The outer orbit is unconstrained with a period range $P_c=20-50$ yr (from 3:1 to 7:1 MMR) for a circumbinary body of substellar mass ($m_c=11-70 M_{Jup.}$). The stable solutions of the minimum and maximum reduced chi-square value were integrated for 100 Myr and confirmed a non-chaotic behavior. Their residuals in the ETV data could be explained by a spin-orbit-coupling model (Applegate-Lanza). Continuous monitoring of the system is required in order to refine and constrain the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Pore Rotation Associated with a C-class Flare from Spectropolarimetric Observations with DKIST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution observations of a C4.1-class solar flare (SOL2023-05-03T20:53) in AR 13293 from the ViSP and VBI instruments at the DKIST. The fast cadence, good resolution, and high polarimetric sensitivity of ViSP data provide a unique opportunity to explore the photospheric magnetic fields before and during the flare. We infer the magnetic field vector in the photosphere from the Fe I 6302 line using Milne-Eddington inversions. Combined analysis of the inverted data and VBI images reveals the presence of two oppositely-polarity pores exhibiting rotational motion both prior to and throughout the flare event. Data-driven simulations further reveal a complex magnetic field topology above the rotating pores, including a null-point-like configuration. We observed a 30% relative change in the horizontal component ($\delta F_h$) of Lorentz force at the flare peak time and roughly no change in the radial component. We find that the changes in $\delta F_h$ are the most likely driver of the observed pore rotation. These findings collectively suggest that the back-reaction of magnetic field line reconfiguration in the corona may influence the magnetic morphology and rotation of pores in the photosphere on a significantly smaller scale.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of weakly collisional plasma: continuous spectra, discrete eigenmodes, and the decay of echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of a weakly collisional plasma is described by the Boltzmann-Poisson equations with the Lenard-Bernstein collision operator. We perform a perturbative analysis of these equations, and obtain exact analytic solutions, enabling definitive resolutions to long-standing controversies regarding the impact of weak collisions on continuous spectra and Landau eigenmodes. Unlike some previous studies, we retain both damping and diffusion terms in the collision operator. We find that the linear response is a temporal convolution of a continuum that depends on the continuous velocities of particles, and discrete modes that encapsulate coherent oscillations. The discrete modes are exponentially damped over time due to collective effects (Landau damping) as well as collisional dissipation. The continuum is also damped by collisions but somewhat differently. Up to a collision time, which is the inverse of the collision frequency $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$, the continuum decay is driven by velocity diffusion and occurs super-exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu^{-1/3}_{\mathrm{c}}$. After a collision time, however, the continuum decay is driven by the collisional damping of particle velocities and diffusion of their positions, and occurs exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu_{\mathrm{c}}$. This hitherto unknown, slow exponential decay causes perturbations to damp the most on scales comparable to the mean free path, but very slowly on larger scales, which establishes the local thermal equilibrium, the essence of the fluid limit. The long-term decay of the response is driven by the discrete modes on scales smaller than the mean free path, but, on larger scales, is governed by the slowly decaying continuum and the least damped discrete mode. Our analysis firmly establishes a long-sought connection between the collisionless and fluid limits of weakly collisional plasmas.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) X. Probing the early chemical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy with carbon abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to constrain the chemo-dynamical properties of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy using carbon abundances. Our sample from the \textit{Pristine} Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) includes $\sim 350$ metal-poor ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-1.5$) stars in the main body of Sgr with good quality spectroscopic observations. Our metal-poor Sgr population has a larger velocity dispersion than metal-rich Sgr from the literature, which could be explained by outside-in star formation, extreme Galactic tidal perturbations and/or the presence of a metal-rich disc/bar $+$ a metal-poor halo. The average carbon abundance [C/Fe] in Sgr is similar to that of other classical dwarf galaxies (DGs) and consistently lower than in the Milky Way by $\sim0.2-0.3$~dex at low metallicity. The interstellar medium in DGs, including Sgr, may have retained yields from more energetic Population~III~and~II supernovae (SNe), thereby reducing the average [C/Fe]. Additionally, SNe~Ia, producing more Fe than C, would start to contribute at lower metallicity in DGs/Sgr than in the Galaxy. The presence of a [C/Fe] gradient for Sgr stars with [Fe/H]~$\gtrsim-2.0$ ($\sim 6.8\times 10^{-4}\ \rm{dex \ arcmin^{-1}}$) suggests that SNe~Ia contributed in the system at those metallicities, especially in its inner regions. There is a low frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Sgr sample. At higher metallicity/carbon abundance (mostly CEMP-s) this may be due to photometric selection effects, but those are less likely to affect CEMP-no stars. We propose that, given the lower average [C/Fe] in DGs, using the same CEMP definition ([C/Fe]~$&gt;+0.7$) as in the Galaxy under-predicts the number of CEMP stars in DGs, and for Sgr a cut at [C/Fe]$~\sim +0.35$ may be more appropriate, which brings the frequency of CEMP stars in agreement with that in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Recommended receiver papers for ALMA users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. The authors now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>

      <title>Accretion vs. Core-Filament Collision: Implications for Streamer Formation in Per-emb-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent millimeter and submillimeter observations have unveiled elongated and asymmetric structures around protostars. These structures, referred to as streamers, often exhibit coherent velocity gradients, seemingly indicating a directed gas flow towards the protostars. However, their origin and role in star formation remain uncertain. A protostellar core Per-emb-2, located in Barnard 1, has a relatively large streamer with $10^4$ au, which is more prominent in emission from carbon chain molecules. We aim to unveil the formation mechanism of this streamer. We conducted mapping observations towards Per-emb-2 using the NRO 45-m telescope. We targeted carbon chain molecular lines such as CCS, HC$_3$N, and HC$_5$N. Using astrodendro, we identified one protostellar and four starless cores, including three new detections, on the Herschel map. The starless and protostellar cores are more or less gravitationally bound. We discovered strong CCS and HC$_3$N emissions extending from the north to the south, appearing to bridge the gap between the protostellar core and the starless core north of it. This bridge spans $3\times 10^4$ au with the velocities from 6.5 to 7.0 km s$^{-1}$. The bridge has the velocity gradient opposite to the streamer. Thus, the streamer is unlikely to be connected to this bridge, suggesting that the streamer does not have an accretion origin. We propose that a collision between a spherical core and the filament has shaped the density structure in this region, consequently triggering star formation within the head-tail-shaped core. In this core-filament collision (CFC) scenario, the collision appears to have fragmented the filament into two structures. The streamer is a bow structure, while the bridge is a remnant of the shock-compressed filament. Thus, we conclude that the Per-emb-2 streamer does not significantly contribute to the mass accumulation towards the protostar.</description>
