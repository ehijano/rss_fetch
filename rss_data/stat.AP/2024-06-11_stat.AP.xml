      <title>Where to place a mosquito trap for West Nile Virus surveillance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid spread of West Nile Virus (WNV) is a growing concern. With no vaccines or specific medications available, prevention through mosquito control is the only solution to curb the spread. Mosquito traps, used to detect viral presence in mosquito populations, are essential tools for WNV surveillance. But how do we decide where to place a mosquito trap? And what makes a good trap location, anyway?
  We present a robust statistical approach to determine a mosquito trap's ability to predict human WNV cases in the Chicago metropolitan area and its suburbs. We then use this value to detect the landscape, demographic, and socioeconomic factors associated with a mosquito trap's predictive ability. This approach enables resource-limited mosquito control programs to identify better trap locations while reducing trap numbers to increase trap-based surveillance efficiency. The approach can also be applied to a wide range of different environmental surveillance programs.</description>

      <title>Modeling of New Energy Vehicles' Impact on Urban Ecology Focusing on Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surging demand for new energy vehicles is driven by the imperative to conserve energy, reduce emissions, and enhance the ecological ambiance. By conducting behavioral analysis and mining usage patterns of new energy vehicles, particular patterns can be identified. For instance, overloading the battery, operating with low battery power, and driving at excessive speeds can all detrimentally affect the battery's performance. To assess the impact of such driving behavior on the urban ecology, an environmental computational modeling method has been proposed to simulate the interaction between new energy vehicles and the environment. To extend the time series data of the vehicle's entire life cycle and the ecological environment within the model sequence data, the LSTM model with Bayesian optimizer is utilized for simulation. The analysis revealed the detrimental effects of poor driving behavior on the environment.</description>

      <title>Application of Black-Litterman Bayesian in Statistical Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \begin{abstract} In this paper, we integrated the statistical arbitrage strategy, pairs trading, into the Black-Litterman model and constructed efficient mean-variance portfolios. Typically, pairs trading underperforms under volatile or distressed market condition because the selected asset pairs fail to revert to equilibrium within the investment horizon. By enhancing this strategy with the Black-Litterman portfolio optimization, we achieved superior performance compared to the S\&amp;P 500 market index under both normal and extreme market conditions. Furthermore, this research presents an innovative idea of incorporating traditional pairs trading strategies into the portfolio optimization framework in a scalable and systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Classical Myelo-Proliferative Neoplasms emergence and development based on real life incidence and mathematical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling offers the opportunity to test hypothesis concerning Myeloproliferative emergence and development. We tested different mathematical models based on a training cohort (n=264 patients) (Registre de la c\^ote d'Or) to determine the emergence and evolution times before JAK2V617F classical Myeloproliferative disorders (respectively Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocytemia) are diagnosed. We dissected the time before diagnosis as two main periods: the time from embryonic development for the JAK2V617F mutation to occur, not disappear and enter in proliferation, and a second time corresponding to the expansion of the clonal population until diagnosis. We demonstrate using progressively complexified models that the rate of active mutation occurrence is not constant and doesn't just rely on individual variability, but rather increases with age and takes a median time of 63.1+/-13 years. A contrario, the expansion time can be considered as constant: 8.8 years once the mutation has emerged. Results were validated in an external cohort (national FIMBANK Cohort, n=1248 patients). Analyzing JAK2V617F Essential Thrombocytema versus Polycythemia Vera, we noticed that the first period of time (rate of active homozygous mutation occurrence) for PV takes approximatively 1.5 years more than for ET to develop when the expansion time was quasi-similar. In conclusion, our multi-step approach and the ultimate time-dependent model of MPN emergence and development demonstrates that the emergence of a JAK2V617F mutation should be linked to an aging mechanism, and indicates a 8-9 years period of time to develop a full MPN.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Power Flow Linearization: Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the theoretical insights of Part I, this paper, as the second part of the tutorial, dives deeper into data-driven power flow linearization (DPFL), focusing on comprehensive numerical testing. The necessity of these simulations stems from the theoretical analysis's inherent limitations, particularly the challenge of identifying the differences in real-world performance among DPFL methods with overlapping theoretical capabilities and/or limitations. The absence of a comprehensive numerical comparison of DPFL approaches in the literature also motivates this paper, especially given the fact that over 95% of existing DPFL studies have not provided any open-source codes. To bridge the gap, this paper first reviews existing DPFL experiments, examining the adopted test scenarios, load fluctuation settings, data sources, considerations for data noise/outliers, and the comparison made so far. Subsequently, this paper evaluates a total of 44 methods, containing over 30 existing DPFL approaches, some innovative DPFL techniques, and several classic physics-driven power flow linearization methods for benchmarking. The evaluation spans various dimensions, including generalizability, applicability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, using various different test cases scaling from 9-bus to 1354-bus systems. The numerical analysis identifies and examines significant trends and consistent findings across all methods under various test cases. It also offers theoretical insights into phenomena like under-performance, failure, excessive computation times, etc. Overall, this paper identifies the differences in the performances of the wide range of DPFL methods, reveals gaps not evident from theoretical discussions, assists in method selection for real-world applications, and provides thorough discussions on open questions within DPFL research, indicating ten potential future directions.</description>

      <title>The green hydrogen ambition and implementation gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green hydrogen is critical for decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors, but faces high costs and investment risks. Here we define and quantify the green hydrogen ambition and implementation gap, showing that meeting hydrogen expectations will remain challenging despite surging announcements of projects and subsidies. Tracking 137 projects over three years, we identify a wide 2022 implementation gap with only 2% of global capacity announcements finished on schedule. In contrast, the 2030 ambition gap towards 1.5{\deg}C scenarios is gradually closing as the announced project pipeline has nearly tripled to 441 GW within three years. However, we estimate that, without carbon pricing, realising all these projects would require global subsidies of \$1.6 trillion (\$1.2 - 2.6 trillion range), far exceeding announced subsidies. Given past and future implementation gaps, policymakers must prepare for prolonged green hydrogen scarcity. Policy support needs to secure hydrogen investments, but should focus on applications where hydrogen is indispensable.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Efficient Model Evaluation through Stratification, Sampling, and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model performance evaluation is a critical and expensive task in machine learning and computer vision. Without clear guidelines, practitioners often estimate model accuracy using a one-time random selection of the data. However, by employing tailored sampling and estimation strategies, one can obtain more precise estimates and reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework for model evaluation that includes stratification, sampling, and estimation components. We examine the statistical properties of each component and evaluate their efficiency (precision). One key result of our work is that stratification via k-means clustering based on accurate predictions of model performance yields efficient estimators. Our experiments on computer vision datasets show that this method consistently provides more precise accuracy estimates than the traditional simple random sampling, even with substantial efficiency gains of 10x. We also find that model-assisted estimators, which leverage predictions of model accuracy on the unlabeled portion of the dataset, are generally more efficient than the traditional estimates based solely on the labeled data.</description>

      <title>Will Southeast Asia be the next global manufacturing hub? A multiway cointegration, causality, and dynamic connectedness analyses on factors influencing offshore decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled multinational corporations to diversify their global supply chain risk and to relocate their factories to Southeast Asian countries beyond China. Such recent phenomena provide a good opportunity to understand the factors that influenced offshore decisions in the last two decades. We propose a new conceptual framework based on econometric approaches to examine the relationships between these factors. Firstly, the Vector Auto Regression (VAR) for multi-way cointegration analysis by a Johansen test as well as the embedding Granger causality analysis to examine offshore decisions--innovation, technology readiness, infrastructure, foreign direct investment (FDI), and intermediate imports. Secondly, a Quantile Vector Autoregressive (QVAR) model is used to assess the dynamic connectedness among Southeast Asian countries based on the offshore factors. This study explores a system-wide experiment to evaluate the spillover effects of offshore decisions. It reports a comprehensive analysis using time-series data collected from the World Bank. The results of the cointegration, causality, and dynamic connectedness analyses show that a subset of Southeast Asian countries have spillover effects on each other. These countries present a multi-way cointegration and dynamic connectedness relationship. The study contributes to policymaking by providing a data-driven innovative approach through a new conceptual framework.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Car-Following Models via Bayesian Dynamic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Car-following behavior modeling is critical for understanding traffic flow dynamics and developing high-fidelity microscopic simulation models. Most existing impulse-response car-following models prioritize computational efficiency and interpretability by using a parsimonious nonlinear function based on immediate preceding state observations. However, this approach disregards historical information, limiting its ability to explain real-world driving data. Consequently, serially correlated residuals are commonly observed when calibrating these models with actual trajectory data, hindering their ability to capture complex and stochastic phenomena. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic regression framework incorporating time series models, such as autoregressive processes, to capture error dynamics. This statistically rigorous calibration outperforms the simple assumption of independent errors and enables more accurate simulation and prediction by leveraging higher-order historical information. We validate the effectiveness of our framework using HighD and OpenACC data, demonstrating improved probabilistic simulations. In summary, our framework preserves the parsimonious nature of traditional car-following models while offering enhanced probabilistic simulations. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/Chengyuan-Zhang/IDM_Bayesian_Calibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonetics is the scientific field concerned with the study of how speech is produced, heard and perceived. It abounds with data, such as acoustic speech recordings, neuroimaging data, or articulatory data. In this paper, we provide an introduction to different areas of phonetics (acoustic phonetics, sociophonetics, speech perception, articulatory phonetics, speech inversion, sound change, and speech technology), an overview of the statistical methods for analyzing their data, and an introduction to the signal processing methods commonly applied to speech recordings. A major transition in the statistical modeling of phonetic data has been the shift from fixed effects to random effects regression models, the modeling of curve data (for instance via GAMMs or FDA methods), and the use of Bayesian methods. This shift has been driven in part by the increased focus on large speech corpora in phonetics, which has been driven by machine learning methods such as forced alignment. We conclude by identifying opportunities for future research.</description>

      <title>Hybrid$^2$ Neural ODE Causal Modeling and an Application to Glycemic Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid models composing mechanistic ODE-based dynamics with flexible and expressive neural network components have grown rapidly in popularity, especially in scientific domains where such ODE-based modeling offers important interpretability and validated causal grounding (e.g., for counterfactual reasoning). The incorporation of mechanistic models also provides inductive bias in standard blackbox modeling approaches, critical when learning from small datasets or partially observed, complex systems. Unfortunately, as the hybrid models become more flexible, the causal grounding provided by the mechanistic model can quickly be lost. We address this problem by leveraging another common source of domain knowledge: \emph{ranking} of treatment effects for a set of interventions, even if the precise treatment effect is unknown. We encode this information in a \emph{causal loss} that we combine with the standard predictive loss to arrive at a \emph{hybrid loss} that biases our learning towards causally valid hybrid models. We demonstrate our ability to achieve a win-win, state-of-the-art predictive performance \emph{and} causal validity, in the challenging task of modeling glucose dynamics post-exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes.</description>

      <title>Seemingly unrelated Bayesian additive regression trees for cost-effectiveness analyses in healthcare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, theoretical results and simulation evidence have shown Bayesian additive regression trees to be a highly-effective method for nonparametric regression. Motivated by cost-effectiveness analyses in health economics, where interest lies in jointly modelling the costs of healthcare treatments and the associated health-related quality of life experienced by a patient, we propose a multivariate extension of BART applicable in regression and classification analyses with several correlated outcome variables. Our framework overcomes some key limitations of existing multivariate BART models by allowing each individual response to be associated with different ensembles of trees, while still handling dependencies between the outcomes. In the case of continuous outcomes, our model is essentially a nonparametric version of seemingly unrelated regression. Likewise, our proposal for binary outcomes is a nonparametric generalisation of the multivariate probit model. We give suggestions for easily interpretable prior distributions, which allow specification of both informative and uninformative priors. We provide detailed discussions of MCMC sampling methods to conduct posterior inference. Our methods are implemented in the R package `suBART'. We showcase their performance through extensive simulations and an application to an empirical case study from health economics. By also accommodating propensity scores in a manner befitting a causal analysis, we find substantial evidence for a novel trauma care intervention's cost-effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative Gaussian Process (GP) model utilizing an ensemble kernel that integrates Radial Basis Function (RBF), Rational Quadratic, and Mat\'ern kernels for product sales forecasting. By applying Bayesian optimization, we efficiently find the optimal weights for each kernel, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex sales data patterns. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional GP models, achieving a notable 98\% accuracy and superior performance across key metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$). This advancement underscores the effectiveness of ensemble kernels and Bayesian optimization in improving predictive accuracy, offering profound implications for machine learning applications in sales forecasting.</description>

      <title>Tree balance in phylogenetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree shape statistics, particularly measures of tree (im)balance, play an important role in the analysis of the shape of phylogenetic trees. With applications ranging from testing evolutionary models to studying the impact of fertility inheritance and selection, or tumor development and language evolution, the assessment of tree balance is crucial. Currently, a multitude of at least 30 (im)balance indices can be found in the literature, alongside numerous other tree shape statistics.
  This diversity prompts essential questions: How can we minimize the selection of indices to mitigate the challenges of multiple testing? Is there a preeminent balance index tailored to specific tasks? Previous studies comparing the statistical power of indices in detecting trees deviating from the Yule model have been limited in scope, utilizing only a subset of indices and alternative tree models.
  This research expands upon the examination of index power, encompassing all established indices and a broader array of alternative models. Our investigation reveals distinct groups of balance indices better suited for different tree models, suggesting that decisions on balance index selection can be enhanced with prior knowledge. Furthermore, we present the \textsf{R} software package \textsf{poweRbal} which allows the inclusion of new indices and models, thus facilitating future research.</description>
