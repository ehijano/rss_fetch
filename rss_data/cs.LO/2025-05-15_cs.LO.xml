      <title>A New Tractable Description Logic under Categorical Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical ontologies contain numerous concept or role names involving negative knowledge such as lacks_part, absence_of. Such a representation with labels rather than logical constructors would not allow a reasoner to interpret lacks_part as a kind of negation of has_part. It is known that adding negation to the tractable Description Logic (DL) EL allowing for conjunction, existential restriction and concept inclusion makes it intractable since the obtained logic includes implicitly disjunction and universal restriction which interact with other constructors. In this paper, we propose a new extension of EL with a weakened negation allowing to represent negative knowledge while retaining tractability. To this end, we introduce categorical semantics of all logical constructors of the DL SH including EL with disjunction, negation, universal restriction, role inclusion and transitive roles. The categorical semantics of a logical constructor is usually described as a set of categorical properties referring to several objects without using set membership. To restore tractability, we have to weaken semantics of disjunction and universal restriction by identifying \emph{independent} categorical properties that are responsible for intractability, and dropping them from the set of categorical properties. We show that the logic resulting from weakening semantics is more expressive than EL with the bottom concept, transitive roles and role inclusion.</description>

      <title>Cyclic system for an algebraic theory of alternating parity automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\omega$-regular languages are a natural extension of the regular languages to the setting of infinite words. Likewise, they are recognised by a host of automata models, one of the most important being Alternating Parity Automata (APAs), a generalisation of B\"uchi automata that symmetrises both the transitions (with universal as well as existential branching) and the acceptance condition (by a parity condition).
  In this work we develop a cyclic proof system manipulating APAs, represented by an algebraic notation of Right Linear Lattice expressions. This syntax dualises that of previously introduced Right Linear Algebras, which comprised a notation for non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs). This dualisation induces a symmetry in the proof systems we design, with lattice operations behaving dually on each side of the sequent. Our main result is the soundness and completeness of our system for $\omega$-language inclusion, heavily exploiting game theoretic techniques from the theory of $\omega$-regular languages.</description>

      <title>Initial Algebra Correspondence under Reachability Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suitable reachability conditions can make two different fixed point semantics of a transition system coincide. For instance, the total and partial expected reward semantics on Markov chains (MCs) coincide whenever the MC at hand is almost surely reachable. In this paper, we present a unifying framework for such reachability conditions that ensures the correspondence of two different semantics. Our categorical framework naturally induces an abstract reachability condition via a suitable adjunction, which allows us to prove coincidences of fixed points, and more generally of initial algebras. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by instantiating several examples, including the almost surely reachability condition for MCs, and the unambiguity condition of automata. We further study a canonical construction of our instance for Markov decision processes by pointwise Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Skeletal Call-by-Need, Smoothly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeletal call-by-need is an optimization of call-by-need evaluation also known as "fully lazy sharing": when the duplication of a value has to take place, it is first split into "skeleton", which is then duplicated, and "flesh" which is instead kept shared. Here, we provide two cost analyses of skeletal call-by-need. Firstly, we provide a family of terms showing that skeletal call-by-need can be asymptotically exponentially faster than call-by-need in both time and space; it is the first such evidence, to our knowledge. Secondly, we prove that skeletal call-by-need can be implemented efficiently, that is, with bi-linear overhead. This result is obtained by providing a new smooth presentation of ideas by Shivers and Wand for the reconstruction of skeletons, which is then smoothly plugged into the study of an abstract machine following the distillation technique by Accattoli et al.</description>

      <title>On verification and constraint generation for families of similar hybrid automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give an overview of results on the analysis of parametric linear hybrid automata, and of systems of similar linear hybrid automata: We present possibilities of describing systems with a parametric (i.e. not explicitly specified) number of similar components which can be connected to other systems, such that some parts in the description might be underspecified (i.e. parametric). We consider global safety properties for such systems, expressed by universally quantified formulae, using quantification over variables ranging over the component systems. We analyze possibilities of using methods for hierarchical reasoning and symbol elimination for determining relationships on (some of) the parameters used in the description of these systems under which the global safety properties are guaranteed to be inductive invariants. We discuss an implementation and illustrate its use on several examples.</description>

      <title>Non-expansive Fuzzy ALC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy description logics serve the representation of vague knowledge, typically letting concepts take truth degrees in the unit interval. Expressiveness, logical properties, and complexity vary strongly with the choice of propositional base. The Lukasiewicz propositional base is generally perceived to have preferable logical properties but often entails high complexity or even undecidability. Contrastingly, the less expressive Zadeh propositional base comes with low complexity but entails essentially no change in logical behaviour compared to the classical case. To strike a balance between these poles, we propose non-expansive fuzzy ALC, in which the Zadeh base is extended with Lukasiewicz connectives where one side is restricted to be a rational constant, that is, with constant shift operators. This allows, for instance, modelling dampened inheritance of properties along roles. We present an unlabelled tableau method for non-expansive fuzzy ALC, which allows reasoning over general TBoxes in EXPTIME like in two-valued ALC.</description>

      <title>Risk-aware Markov Decision Processes Using Cumulative Prospect Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is the first theory for decision-making under uncertainty that combines full theoretical soundness and empirically realistic features [P.P. Wakker - Prospect theory: For risk and ambiguity, Page 2]. While CPT was originally considered in one-shot settings for risk-aware decision-making, we consider CPT in sequential decision-making. The most fundamental and well-studied models for sequential decision-making are Markov chains (MCs), and their generalization Markov decision processes (MDPs). The complexity theoretic study of MCs and MDPs with CPT is a fundamental problem that has not been addressed in the literature.
  Our contributions are as follows: First, we present an alternative viewpoint for the CPT-value of MCs and MDPs. This allows us to establish a connection with multi-objective reachability analysis and conclude the strategy complexity result that memoryless randomized strategies are necessary and sufficient for optimality. Second, based on this connection, we provide an algorithm for computing the CPT-value in MDPs with infinite-horizon objectives. We show that the problem is in EXPTIME and fixed-parameter tractable. Moreover, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case of MCs.</description>

      <title>Teaching Divisibility and Binomials with Coq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this contribution is to provide worksheets in Coq for students to learn about divisibility and binomials. These basic topics are a good case study as they are widely taught in the early academic years (or before in France). We present here our technical and pedagogical choices, the numerous exercises we developed and a small experiment we conducted on two students. As expected, it required additional Coq material such as other lemmas and dedicated tactics. The worksheets are freely available and flexible in several ways.</description>

      <title>Synthesis with Privacy Against an Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study automatic synthesis of systems that interact with their environment and maintain privacy against an observer to the interaction. The system and the environment interact via sets $I$ and $O$ of input and output signals. The input to the synthesis problem contains, in addition to a specification, also a list of secrets, a function $cost: I\cup O\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, which maps each signal to the cost of hiding it, and a bound $b\in\mathbb{N}$ on the budget that the system may use for hiding of signals. The desired output is an $(I/O)$-transducer $T$ and a set $H\subseteq I\cup O$ of signals that respects the bound on the budget, thus $\sum_{s\in H} cost(s)\leq b$, such that for every possible interaction of $T$, the generated computation satisfies the specification, yet an observer, from whom the signals in $H$ are hidden, cannot evaluate the secrets.
  We first show that the problem's complexity is 2EXPTIME-complete for specifications and secrets in LTL, making it no harder than synthesis without privacy requirements. We then analyze the complexity further, isolating the two aspects that do not exist in traditional synthesis: the need to hide secret values and the need to choose the set $H$. We do this by studying settings in which traditional synthesis is solvable in polynomial time -- when the specification formalism is deterministic automata and when the system is closed -- and show that each of these aspects adds an exponential blow-up in complexity. We continue and study bounded synthesis with privacy, where the input includes a bound on the synthesized transducer size, as well as a variant of the problem in which the observer has knowledge, either about the specification or about the system, which can be helpful in evaluating the secrets. Additionally, we study certified privacy, where the synthesis algorithm provides certification that the secrets remain hidden.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Uncertainty for Querying Inconsistent Description Logics Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09138v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The necessity to manage inconsistency in Description Logics Knowledge Bases (KBs) has come to the fore with the increasing importance gained by the Semantic Web, where information comes from different sources that constantly change their content and may contain contradictory descriptions when considered either alone or together. Classical reasoning algorithms do not handle inconsistent KBs, forcing the debugging of the KB in order to remove the inconsistency. In this paper, we exploit an existing probabilistic semantics called DISPONTE to overcome this problem and allow queries also in case of inconsistent KBs. We implemented our approach in the reasoners TRILL and BUNDLE and empirically tested the validity of our proposal. Moreover, we formally compare the presented approach to that of the repair semantics, one of the most established semantics when considering DL reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Deontic Temporal Logic for Formal Verification of AI Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring ethical behavior in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems amidst their increasing ubiquity and influence is a major concern the world over. The use of formal methods in AI ethics is a possible crucial approach for specifying and verifying the ethical behavior of AI systems. This paper proposes a formalization based on deontic logic to define and evaluate the ethical behavior of AI systems, focusing on system-level specifications, contributing to this important goal. It introduces axioms and theorems to capture ethical requirements related to fairness and explainability. The formalization incorporates temporal operators to reason about the ethical behavior of AI systems over time. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of this formalization by assessing the ethics of the real-world COMPAS and loan prediction AI systems. Various ethical properties of the COMPAS and loan prediction systems are encoded using deontic logical formulas, allowing the use of an automated theorem prover to verify whether these systems satisfy the defined properties. The formal verification reveals that both systems fail to fulfill certain key ethical properties related to fairness and non-discrimination, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed formalization in identifying potential ethical issues in real-world AI applications.</description>

      <title>Naturality for higher-dimensional path types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a naturality construction for the operations of weak omega-categories, as a meta-operation in a dependent type theory. Our construction has a geometrical motivation as a local tensor product with a directed interval, and behaves logically as a globular analogue of Reynolds parametricity. Our construction operates as a ``power tool'' to support construction of terms with geometrical structure, and we use it to define composition operations for cylinders and cones in omega-categories. The machinery can generate terms of high complexity, and we have implemented our construction in a proof assistant, which verifies that the generated terms have the correct type. All our results can be exported to homotopy type theory, allowing the explicit computation of complex path type inhabitants.</description>
