      <title>Transcending Dimensions using Generative AI: Real-Time 3D Model Generation in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional 3D modeling requires technical expertise, specialized software, and time-intensive processes, making it inaccessible for many users. Our research aims to lower these barriers by combining generative AI and augmented reality (AR) into a cohesive system that allows users to easily generate, manipulate, and interact with 3D models in real time, directly within AR environments. Utilizing cutting-edge AI models like Shap-E, we address the complex challenges of transforming 2D images into 3D representations in AR environments. Key challenges such as object isolation, handling intricate backgrounds, and achieving seamless user interaction are tackled through advanced object detection methods, such as Mask R-CNN. Evaluation results from 35 participants reveal an overall System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 69.64, with participants who engaged with AR/VR technologies more frequently rating the system significantly higher, at 80.71. This research is particularly relevant for applications in gaming, education, and AR-based e-commerce, offering intuitive, model creation for users without specialized skills.</description>

      <title>GauSS-MI: Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information for Active 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research tackles the challenge of real-time active view selection and uncertainty quantification on visual quality for active 3D reconstruction. Visual quality is a critical aspect of 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have notably enhanced the image rendering quality of reconstruction models. Nonetheless, the efficient and effective acquisition of input images for reconstruction-specifically, the selection of the most informative viewpoint-remains an open challenge, which is crucial for active reconstruction. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating geometric completeness and exploring unobserved or unknown regions, without direct evaluation of the visual uncertainty within the reconstruction model. To address this gap, this paper introduces a probabilistic model that quantifies visual uncertainty for each Gaussian. Leveraging Shannon Mutual Information, we formulate a criterion, Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information (GauSS-MI), for real-time assessment of visual mutual information from novel viewpoints, facilitating the selection of next best view. GauSS-MI is implemented within an active reconstruction system integrated with a view and motion planner. Extensive experiments across various simulated and real-world scenes showcase the superior visual quality and reconstruction efficiency performance of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>PhysicsFC: Learning User-Controlled Skills for a Physics-Based Football Player Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose PhysicsFC, a method for controlling physically simulated football player characters to perform a variety of football skills--such as dribbling, trapping, moving, and kicking--based on user input, while seamlessly transitioning between these skills. Our skill-specific policies, which generate latent variables for each football skill, are trained using an existing physics-based motion embedding model that serves as a foundation for reproducing football motions. Key features include a tailored reward design for the Dribble policy, a two-phase reward structure combined with projectile dynamics-based initialization for the Trap policy, and a Data-Embedded Goal-Conditioned Latent Guidance (DEGCL) method for the Move policy. Using the trained skill policies, the proposed football player finite state machine (PhysicsFC FSM) allows users to interactively control the character. To ensure smooth and agile transitions between skill policies, as defined in the FSM, we introduce the Skill Transition-Based Initialization (STI), which is applied during the training of each skill policy. We develop several interactive scenarios to showcase PhysicsFC's effectiveness, including competitive trapping and dribbling, give-and-go plays, and 11v11 football games, where multiple PhysicsFC agents produce natural and controllable physics-based football player behaviors. Quantitative evaluations further validate the performance of individual skill policies and the transitions between them, using the presented metrics and experimental designs.</description>

      <title>LSNIF: Locally-Subdivided Neural Intersection Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural representations have shown the potential to accelerate ray casting in a conventional ray-tracing-based rendering pipeline. We introduce a novel approach called Locally-Subdivided Neural Intersection Function (LSNIF) that replaces bottom-level BVHs used as traditional geometric representations with a neural network. Our method introduces a sparse hash grid encoding scheme incorporating geometry voxelization, a scene-agnostic training data collection, and a tailored loss function. It enables the network to output not only visibility but also hit-point information and material indices. LSNIF can be trained offline for a single object, allowing us to use LSNIF as a replacement for its corresponding BVH. With these designs, the network can handle hit-point queries from any arbitrary viewpoint, supporting all types of rays in the rendering pipeline. We demonstrate that LSNIF can render a variety of scenes, including real-world scenes designed for other path tracers, while achieving a memory footprint reduction of up to 106.2x compared to a compressed BVH.</description>

      <title>Mochi: Collision Detection for Spherical Particles using GPU Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient Discrete Collision Detection (DCD) uses indexing structures for acceleration, and developing these structures demands meticulous programmer efforts to achieve performance. The Ray-Tracing (RT) architecture of GPUs builds and traverses an indexing structure called Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) and performs geometric intersection tests, which are all the essential components of a DCD kernel. However, BVHs built by the RT architecture are neither accessible nor programmable; the only way to use this architecture is to launch rays and map DCD queries to ray traversal.
  Despite these challenges, we developed an RT-accelerated DCD framework, Mochi, for handling spherical objects. Mochi optimizes collision detection by utilizing hardware-accelerated BVH traversal in the broad phase and introducing a novel object-object intersection test in the narrow phase. We evaluate Mochi showing speedups on all of our end-to-end particle simulation benchmarks when compared to uniform grid and hash map implementations in Taichi, a high-performance framework targeting graphics applications, and the state-of-the-art BVH implementation.</description>

      <title>HeadEvolver: Text to Head Avatars via Expressive and Attribute-Preserving Mesh Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current text-to-avatar methods often rely on implicit representations (e.g., NeRF, SDF, and DMTet), leading to 3D content that artists cannot easily edit and animate in graphics software. This paper introduces a novel framework for generating stylized head avatars from text guidance, which leverages locally learnable mesh deformation and 2D diffusion priors to achieve high-quality digital assets for attribute-preserving manipulation. Given a template mesh, our method represents mesh deformation with per-face Jacobians and adaptively modulates local deformation using a learnable vector field. This vector field enables anisotropic scaling while preserving the rotation of vertices, which can better express identity and geometric details. We employ landmark- and contour-based regularization terms to balance the expressiveness and plausibility of generated avatars from multiple views without relying on any specific shape prior. Our framework can generate realistic shapes and textures that can be further edited via text, while supporting seamless editing using the preserved attributes from the template mesh, such as 3DMM parameters, blendshapes, and UV coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate diverse and expressive head avatars with high-quality meshes that artists can easily manipulate in graphics software, facilitating downstream applications such as efficient asset creation and animation with preserved attributes.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty for SVBRDF Acquisition using Frequency Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to quantify uncertainty for SVBRDF acquisition in multi-view captures. Under uncontrolled illumination and unstructured viewpoints, there is no guarantee that the observations contain enough information to reconstruct the appearance properties of a captured object. We study this ambiguity, or uncertainty, using entropy and accelerate the analysis by using the frequency domain, rather than the domain of incoming and outgoing viewing angles. The result is a method that computes a map of uncertainty over an entire object within a millisecond. We find that the frequency model allows us to recover SVBRDF parameters with competitive performance, that the accelerated entropy computation matches results with a physically-based path tracer, and that there is a positive correlation between error and uncertainty. We then show that the uncertainty map can be applied to improve SVBRDF acquisition using capture guidance, sharing information on the surface, and using a diffusion model to inpaint uncertain regions. Our code is available at https://github.com/rubenwiersma/svbrdf_uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Depth Perception in Foveated Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The true vision for real-time virtual and augmented reality is reproducing our visual reality in its entirety on immersive displays. To this end, foveated rendering leverages the limitations of spatial acuity in human peripheral vision to allocate computational resources to the fovea while reducing quality in the periphery. Such methods are often derived from studies on the spatial resolution of the human visual system and its ability to perceive blur in the periphery, enabling the potential for high spatial quality in real-time. However, the effects of blur on other visual cues that depend on luminance contrast, such as depth, remain largely unexplored. It is critical to understand this interplay, as accurate depth representation is a fundamental aspect of visual realism. In this paper, we present the first evaluation exploring the effects of foveated rendering on stereoscopic depth perception. We design a psychovisual experiment to quantitatively study the effects of peripheral blur on depth perception. Our analysis demonstrates that stereoscopic acuity remains unaffected (or even improves) by high levels of peripheral blur. Based on our studies, we derive a simple perceptual model that determines the amount of foveation that does not affect stereoacuity. Furthermore, we analyze the model in the context of common foveation practices reported in literature. The findings indicate that foveated rendering does not impact stereoscopic depth perception, and stereoacuity remains unaffected with up to 2x stronger foveation than commonly used. Finally, we conduct a validation experiment and show that our findings hold for complex natural stimuli.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diffusion Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of producing high-quality contents such as images, videos, and audio, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize digital content creation. However, these capabilities come at the cost of their significant computational resources and lengthy generation time, underscoring the critical need to develop efficient techniques for practical deployment. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of research on efficient diffusion models. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient diffusion model topics from algorithm-level, system-level, and framework perspective, respectively. We have also created a GitHub repository where we organize the papers featured in this survey at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-Diffusion-Model-Survey. We hope our survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners gain a systematic understanding of efficient diffusion model research and inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field.</description>

      <title>ForceGrip: Reference-Free Curriculum Learning for Realistic Grip Force Control in VR Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic Hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods. Demo videos are available as supplementary material and the code is provided at https://han-dongheun.github.io/ForceGrip.</description>
