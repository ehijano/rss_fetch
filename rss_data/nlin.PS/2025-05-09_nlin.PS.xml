      <title>Frequency Synchronization Induced by Frequency Detuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely held that identical systems tend to behave similarly under comparable conditions. Yet, for systems that interact through a network, symmetry breaking can lead to scenarios in which this expectation does not hold. Prominent examples are chimera states in multistable phase-oscillator networks. Here, we show that for a broad class of such networks, asynchronous states can be converted into frequency-synchronized states when identical oscillators are detuned to have different intrinsic frequencies. Importantly, we show that frequency synchronization is achieved over a range of intrinsic frequency detuning and is thus a robust effect. These results, which are supported by theory, simulations, and electrochemical oscillator experiments, reveal a counterintuitive opportunity to use parameter heterogeneity to promote synchronization.</description>

      <title>Numerically modelling semidirect product geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper numerically investigates Euler-Poincar\'e equations arising from a self-semidirect product group structure. Nonlinearly coupled systems of equations emerge from the semidirect product action where one set of dynamics can be considered in the frame of another. A monolithic energy-preserving continuous Galerkin finite element method is used to study geodesic equations associated with the semidirect product of the diffeomorphism group on a circle with itself. Theoretically predicted peakon solutions are observed as an emergent behaviour. In addition, complicated nonlinear transfers of energy are associated with the semidirect product coupling, where amongst various nonlinear interactions, we observe coupled peakon behaviour. A mimetic (C-grid) finite difference method is used to study the geodesic flow of the semidirect product of the volume preserving diffeomorphism group with itself, where similar coupling behaviour is observed in the vorticity variables. We also investigate coadjoint and Lie-Poisson structures in the context of geodesic equations on semidirect product groups, where the underlying group is first extended by central extension or semidirect product.</description>

      <title>Effect of Levy noise on the network of coupled Chialvo neurons: Impact of topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the complex spatiotemporal behaviors of Chialvo neuron maps under the influence of Levy noise on three different network topologies that is a ring network, a two dimensional lattice affected by electromagnetic flux, and a delayed coupled lattice. On the ring structure, we show that adding non uniform Levy noise induces the formation of new collective dynamics like standing and traveling waves. The frequency and type of these emergent patterns depend sensitively on the intrinsic excitability parameter and the noise intensity, revealing new pathways to control synchronization behavior through noise modulation. In the 2D lattice network, we show that electromagnetic flux and noise together induce a diverse range of behaviors, from synchronized waves to desynchronized states. Most strikingly, spiral wave chimeras emerge under moderate noise, with coherent and incoherent regions coexisting, highlighting the fine balance between external forcing and stochastic perturbations. Finally, upon introducing delay in the lattice structure, the system displays a rich variety of dynamical regimes such as labyrinth patterns, rotating spirals, and target waves whose stability and transitions are greatly affected by both delay and coupling strength.</description>
