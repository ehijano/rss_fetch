      <title>Eight-Partitioning Points in 3D, and Efficiently Too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \emph{eight-partition} of a finite set of points (respectively, of a continuous mass distribution) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of three planes that divide the space into $8$ octants, such that each open octant contains at most $1/8$ of the points (respectively, of the mass). In 1966, Hadwiger showed that any mass distribution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition; moreover, one can prescribe the normal direction of one of the three planes. The analogous result for finite point sets follows by a standard limit argument.
  We prove the following variant of this result: Any mass distribution (or point set) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition for which the intersection of two of the planes is a line with a prescribed direction.
  Moreover, we present an efficient algorithm for calculating an eight-partition of a set of $n$ points in~$\mathbb{R}^3$ (with prescribed normal direction of one of the planes) in time $O^{*}(n^{5/2})$.</description>

      <title>Space Complexity of Euclidean Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $(k, z)$-Clustering problem in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ has been extensively studied. Given the scale of data involved, compression methods for the Euclidean $(k, z)$-Clustering problem, such as data compression and dimension reduction, have received significant attention in the literature. However, the space complexity of the clustering problem, specifically, the number of bits required to compress the cost function within a multiplicative error $\varepsilon$, remains unclear in existing literature.
  This paper initiates the study of space complexity for Euclidean $(k, z)$-Clustering and offers both upper and lower bounds. Our space bounds are nearly tight when $k$ is constant, indicating that storing a coreset, a well-known data compression approach, serves as the optimal compression scheme. Furthermore, our lower bound result for $(k, z)$-Clustering establishes a tight space bound of $\Theta( n d )$ for terminal embedding, where $n$ represents the dataset size. Our technical approach leverages new geometric insights for principal angles and discrepancy methods, which may hold independent interest.</description>

      <title>Metric Optimization in Penner Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many parametrization and mapping-related problems in geometry processing can be viewed as metric optimization problems, i.e., computing a metric minimizing a functional and satisfying a set of constraints, such as flatness. Penner coordinates are global coordinates on the space of metrics on meshes with a fixed vertex set and topology, but varying connectivity, making it homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension equal to the number of edges in the mesh, without any additional constraints imposed. These coordinates play an important role in the theory of discrete conformal maps, enabling recent development of highly robust algorithms with convergence and solution existence guarantees for computing such maps. We demonstrate how Penner coordinates can be used to solve a general class of optimization problems involving metrics, including optimization and interpolation, while retaining the key solution existence guarantees available for discrete conformal maps.</description>

      <title>On the bottleneck stability of rank decompositions of multi-parameter persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant part of modern topological data analysis is concerned with the design and study of algebraic invariants of poset representations -- often referred to as multi-parameter persistence modules. One such invariant is the minimal rank decomposition, which encodes the ranks of all the structure morphisms of the persistence module by a single ordered pair of rectangle-decomposable modules, interpreted as a signed barcode. This signed barcode generalizes the concept of persistence barcode from one-parameter persistence to any number of parameters, raising the question of its bottleneck stability. We show in this paper that the minimal rank decomposition is not stable under the natural notion of signed bottleneck matching between signed barcodes. We remedy this by turning our focus to the rank exact decomposition, a related signed barcode induced by the minimal projective resolution of the module relative to the so-called rank exact structure, which we prove to be bottleneck stable under signed matchings. As part of our proof, we obtain two intermediate results of independent interest: we compute the global dimension of the rank exact structure on the category of finitely presentable multi-parameter persistence modules, and we prove a bottleneck stability result for hook-decomposable modules. We also give a bound for the size of the rank exact decomposition that is polynomial in the size of the usual minimal projective resolution, we prove a universality result for the dissimilarity function induced by the notion of signed matching, and we compute, in the two-parameter case, the global dimension of a different exact structure related to the upsets of the indexing poset. This set of results combines concepts from topological data analysis and from the representation theory of posets, and we believe is relevant to both areas.</description>
