      <title>AI Risk Categorization Decoded (AIR 2024): From Government Regulations to Corporate Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive AI risk taxonomy derived from eight government policies from the European Union, United States, and China and 16 company policies worldwide, making a significant step towards establishing a unified language for generative AI safety evaluation. We identify 314 unique risk categories organized into a four-tiered taxonomy. At the highest level, this taxonomy encompasses System &amp; Operational Risks, Content Safety Risks, Societal Risks, and Legal &amp; Rights Risks. The taxonomy establishes connections between various descriptions and approaches to risk, highlighting the overlaps and discrepancies between public and private sector conceptions of risk. By providing this unified framework, we aim to advance AI safety through information sharing across sectors and the promotion of best practices in risk mitigation for generative AI models and systems.</description>

      <title>AI Cards: Towards an Applied Framework for Machine-Readable AI and Risk Documentation Inspired by the EU AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the upcoming enforcement of the EU AI Act, documentation of high-risk AI systems and their risk management information will become a legal requirement playing a pivotal role in demonstration of compliance. Despite its importance, there is a lack of standards and guidelines to assist with drawing up AI and risk documentation aligned with the AI Act. This paper aims to address this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the AI Act's provisions regarding technical documentation, wherein we particularly focus on AI risk management. On the basis of this analysis, we propose AI Cards as a novel holistic framework for representing a given intended use of an AI system by encompassing information regarding technical specifications, context of use, and risk management, both in human- and machine-readable formats. While the human-readable representation of AI Cards provides AI stakeholders with a transparent and comprehensible overview of the AI use case, its machine-readable specification leverages on state of the art Semantic Web technologies to embody the interoperability needed for exchanging documentation within the AI value chain. This brings the flexibility required for reflecting changes applied to the AI system and its context, provides the scalability needed to accommodate potential amendments to legal requirements, and enables development of automated tools to assist with legal compliance and conformity assessment tasks. To solidify the benefits, we provide an exemplar AI Card for an AI-based student proctoring system and further discuss its potential applications within and beyond the context of the AI Act.</description>

      <title>From Counting Stations to City-Wide Estimates: Data-Driven Bicycle Volume Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shifting to cycling in urban areas reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves public health. Street-level bicycle volume information would aid cities in planning targeted infrastructure improvements to encourage cycling and provide civil society with evidence to advocate for cyclists' needs. Yet, the data currently available to cities and citizens often only comes from sparsely located counting stations. This paper extrapolates bicycle volume beyond these few locations to estimate bicycle volume for the entire city of Berlin. We predict daily and average annual daily street-level bicycle volumes using machine-learning techniques and various public data sources. These include app-based crowdsourced data, infrastructure, bike-sharing, motorized traffic, socioeconomic indicators, weather, and holiday data. Our analysis reveals that the best-performing model is XGBoost, and crowdsourced cycling and infrastructure data are most important for the prediction. We further simulate how collecting short-term counts at predicted locations improves performance. By providing ten days of such sample counts for each predicted location to the model, we are able to halve the error and greatly reduce the variability in performance among predicted locations.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing mechanisms of social contagion from local network view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18519v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of individual behavioural patterns is largely determined by stimuli arriving from peers via social interactions or from external sources. Based on these influences, individuals are commonly assumed to follow simple or complex adoption rules, inducing social contagion processes. In reality, multiple adoption rules may coexist even within the same social contagion process, introducing additional complexity into the spreading phenomena. Our goal is to understand whether coexisting adoption mechanisms can be distinguished from a microscopic view, at the egocentric network level, without requiring global information about the underlying network, or the unfolding spreading process. We formulate this question as a classification problem, and study it through a Bayesian likelihood approach and with random forest classifiers in various synthetic and data-driven experiments. This study offers a novel perspective on the observations of propagation processes at the egocentric level and a better understanding of landmark contagion mechanisms from a local view.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Approaches for Detecting Adversarial Cyberbullying and Hate Speech in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyberbullying is a significant concern intricately linked to technology that can find resolution through technological means. Despite its prevalence, technology also provides solutions to mitigate cyberbullying. To address growing concerns regarding the adverse impact of cyberbullying on individuals' online experiences, various online platforms and researchers are actively adopting measures to enhance the safety of digital environments. While researchers persist in crafting detection models to counteract or minimize cyberbullying, malicious actors are deploying adversarial techniques to circumvent these detection methods. This paper focuses on detecting cyberbullying in adversarial attack content within social networking site text data, specifically emphasizing hate speech. Utilizing a deep learning-based approach with a correction algorithm, this paper yielded significant results. An LSTM model with a fixed epoch of 100 demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC scores of 87.57%, 88.73%, 87.57%, 88.15%, and 91% respectively. Additionally, the LSTM model's performance surpassed that of previous studies.</description>

      <title>A Moonshot for AI Oracles in the Sciences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nobel laureate Philip Anderson and Elihu Abrahams once stated that, "even if machines did contribute to normal science, we see no mechanism by which they could create a Kuhnian revolution and thereby establish a new physical law." In this Perspective, we draw upon insights from the philosophies of science and artificial intelligence (AI) to propose necessary conditions of precisely such a mechanism for generating revolutionary mathematical theories. Recent advancements in AI suggest that satisfying the proposed necessary conditions by machines may be plausible; thus, our proposed necessary conditions also define a moonshot challenge. We also propose a heuristic definition of the intelligibility of mathematical theories to accelerate the development of machine theorists.</description>

      <title>ArzEn-LLM: Code-Switched Egyptian Arabic-English Translation and Speech Recognition Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the widespread increase in the phenomenon of code-switching between Egyptian Arabic and English in recent times, this paper explores the intricacies of machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, focusing on translating code-switched Egyptian Arabic-English to either English or Egyptian Arabic. Our goal is to present the methodologies employed in developing these systems, utilizing large language models such as LLama and Gemma. In the field of ASR, we explore the utilization of the Whisper model for code-switched Egyptian Arabic recognition, detailing our experimental procedures including data preprocessing and training techniques. Through the implementation of a consecutive speech-to-text translation system that integrates ASR with MT, we aim to overcome challenges posed by limited resources and the unique characteristics of the Egyptian Arabic dialect. Evaluation against established metrics showcases promising results, with our methodologies yielding a significant improvement of $56\%$ in English translation over the state-of-the-art and $9.3\%$ in Arabic translation. Since code-switching is deeply inherent in spoken languages, it is crucial that ASR systems can effectively handle this phenomenon. This capability is crucial for enabling seamless interaction in various domains, including business negotiations, cultural exchanges, and academic discourse. Our models and code are available as open-source resources.

      <title>ResumeAtlas: Revisiting Resume Classification with Large-Scale Datasets and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on online recruitment platforms coupled with the adoption of AI technologies has highlighted the critical need for efficient resume classification methods. However, challenges such as small datasets, lack of standardized resume templates, and privacy concerns hinder the accuracy and effectiveness of existing classification models. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a comprehensive approach to resume classification. We curated a large-scale dataset of 13,389 resumes from diverse sources and employed Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT and Gemma1.1 2B for classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional machine learning approaches, with our best model achieving a top-1 accuracy of 92\% and a top-5 accuracy of 97.5\%. These findings underscore the importance of dataset quality and advanced model architectures in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of resume classification systems, thus advancing the field of online recruitment practices.</description>

      <title>Investigating writing style as a contributor to gender gaps in science and technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing stream of research finds that scientific contributions are evaluated differently depending on the gender of the author. In this article, we consider whether gender differences in writing styles - how men and women communicate their work - may contribute to these observed gender gaps. We ground our investigation in a framework for characterizing the linguistic style of written text, with two sets of features - informational (i.e., features that emphasize facts) and involved (i.e., features that emphasize relationships). Using a large sample of academic papers and patents, we find significant differences in writing style by gender, with women using more involved features in their writing. Papers and patents with more involved features also tend to be cited more by women. Our findings suggest that scientific text is not devoid of personal character, which could contribute to bias in evaluation, thereby compromising the norm of universalism as a foundational principle of science.</description>

      <title>Fusion of the Power from Citations: Enhance your Influence by Integrating Information from References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influence prediction plays a crucial role in the academic community. The amount of scholars' influence determines whether their work will be accepted by others. Most existing research focuses on predicting one paper's citation count after a period or identifying the most influential papers among the massive candidates, without concentrating on an individual paper's negative or positive impact on its authors. Thus, this study aims to formulate the prediction problem to identify whether one paper can increase scholars' influence or not, which can provide feedback to the authors before they publish their papers. First, we presented the self-adapted ACC (Average Annual Citation Counts) metric to measure authors' impact yearly based on their annual published papers, paper citation counts, and contributions in each paper. Then, we proposed the RD-GAT (Reference-Depth Graph Attention Network) model to integrate heterogeneous graph information from different depth of references by assigning attention coefficients on them. Experiments on AMiner dataset demonstrated that the proposed ACC metrics could represent the authors influence effectively, and the RD-GAT model is more efficiently on the academic citation network, and have stronger robustness against the overfitting problem compared with the baseline models. By applying the framework in this work, scholars can identify whether their papers can improve their influence in the future.</description>

      <title>Google's Chrome Antitrust Paradox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article delves into Google's dominance of the browser market, highlighting how Google's Chrome browser is playing a critical role in asserting Google's dominance in other markets. While Google perpetuates the perception that Google Chrome is a neutral platform built on open-source technologies, we argue that Chrome is instrumental in Google's strategy to reinforce its dominance in online advertising, publishing, and the browser market itself. Our examination of Google's strategic acquisitions, anti-competitive practices, and the implementation of so-called "privacy controls," shows that Chrome is far from a neutral gateway to the web. Rather, it serves as a key tool for Google to maintain and extend its market power, often to the detriment of competition and innovation.
  We examine how Chrome not only bolsters Google's position in advertising and publishing through practices such as coercion, and self-preferencing, it also helps leverage its advertising clout to engage in a "pay-to-play" paradigm, which serves as a cornerstone in Google's larger strategy of market control. We also discuss potential regulatory interventions and remedies, drawing on historical antitrust precedents. We propose a triad of solutions motivated from our analysis of Google's abuse of Chrome: behavioral remedies targeting specific anti-competitive practices, structural remedies involving an internal separation of Google's divisions, and divestment of Chrome from Google.
  Despite Chrome's dominance and its critical role in Google's ecosystem, it has escaped antitrust scrutiny -- a gap our article aims to bridge. Addressing this gap is instrumental to solve current market imbalances and future challenges brought on by increasingly hegemonizing technology firms, ensuring a competitive digital environment that nurtures innovation and safeguards consumer interests.</description>

      <title>ObjFormer: Learning Land-Cover Changes From Paired OSM Data and Optical High-Resolution Imagery via Object-Guided Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical high-resolution imagery and OSM data are two important data sources of change detection (CD). Previous related studies focus on utilizing the information in OSM data to aid the CD on optical high-resolution images. This paper pioneers the direct detection of land-cover changes utilizing paired OSM data and optical imagery, thereby expanding the scope of CD tasks. To this end, we propose an object-guided Transformer (ObjFormer) by naturally combining the object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique with the advanced vision Transformer architecture. This combination can significantly reduce the computational overhead in the self-attention module without adding extra parameters or layers. ObjFormer has a hierarchical pseudo-siamese encoder consisting of object-guided self-attention modules that extracts multi-level heterogeneous features from OSM data and optical images; a decoder consisting of object-guided cross-attention modules can recover land-cover changes from the extracted heterogeneous features. Beyond basic binary change detection, this paper raises a new semi-supervised semantic change detection task that does not require any manually annotated land-cover labels to train semantic change detectors. Two lightweight semantic decoders are added to ObjFormer to accomplish this task efficiently. A converse cross-entropy loss is designed to fully utilize negative samples, contributing to the great performance improvement in this task. A large-scale benchmark dataset called OpenMapCD containing 1,287 samples covering 40 regions on six continents is constructed to conduct detailed experiments. The results show the effectiveness of our methods in this new kind of CD task. Additionally, case studies in Japanese cities demonstrate the framework's generalizability and practical potential. The OpenMapCD and source code are available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/ObjFormer</description>

      <title>A Survey of Privacy-Preserving Model Explanations: Privacy Risks, Attacks, and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the adoption of explainable AI (XAI) continues to expand, the urgency to address its privacy implications intensifies. Despite a growing corpus of research in AI privacy and explainability, there is little attention on privacy-preserving model explanations. This article presents the first thorough survey about privacy attacks on model explanations and their countermeasures. Our contribution to this field comprises a thorough analysis of research papers with a connected taxonomy that facilitates the categorisation of privacy attacks and countermeasures based on the targeted explanations. This work also includes an initial investigation into the causes of privacy leaks. Finally, we discuss unresolved issues and prospective research directions uncovered in our analysis. This survey aims to be a valuable resource for the research community and offers clear insights for those new to this domain. To support ongoing research, we have established an online resource repository, which will be continuously updated with new and relevant findings. Interested readers are encouraged to access our repository at https://github.com/tamlhp/awesome-privex.</description>

      <title>Where there's a will there's a way: ChatGPT is used more for science in countries where it is prohibited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulating AI is a key societal challenge, but which regulation methods are effective is unclear. This study measures the effectiveness of restricting AI services geographically, focusing on ChatGPT. OpenAI restricts ChatGPT access in several countries, including China and Russia. If restrictions are effective, ChatGPT use should be minimal in these countries. We measured use with a classifier based on distinctive word usage found in early versions of ChatGPT, e.g. "delve." We trained the classifier on pre- and post-ChatGPT "polished" abstracts and found it outperformed GPTZero and ZeroGPT on validation sets, including papers with self-reported AI use. Applying the classifier to preprints from Arxiv, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv showed ChatGPT was used in about 12.6% of preprints by August 2023, with 7.7% higher usage in restricted countries. The gap appeared before China's first major legal LLM became widely available. To test the possibility that, due to high demand, use in restricted countries would have been even higher without restrictions, we compared Asian countries with high expected demand (where English is not an official language) and found that use was higher in those with restrictions. ChatGPT use was correlated with higher views and downloads, but not citations or journal placement. Overall, restricting ChatGPT geographically has proven ineffective in science and possibly other domains, likely due to widespread workarounds.</description>
