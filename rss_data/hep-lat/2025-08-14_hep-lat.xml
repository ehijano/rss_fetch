      <title>Probing Nucleon-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$Interaction via Lattice QCD at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume $\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the $^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel, indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2) channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided, emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated as well.</description>

      <title>Baryon-baryon, meson-meson, and meson-baryon interactions in nonrelativistic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals potentials describing interactions between color-singlet mesons and/or baryons vanish at leading order in potential nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD). This result and constraints from Gauss's law are used to prove that weakly-coupled pNRQCD van der Waals potentials in generic non-Abelian gauge theories with only heavy quarks are too weak to form bound states whose color state is a product of color-singlets. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of four, five, and six quarks with equal masses provide numerical evidence that exotic color configurations are higher energy than products of color-singlet hadrons, suggesting that equal-mass fully-heavy tetraquark, pentaquark, and hexaquark bound states do not exist at next-to-leading order in pNRQCD and at all orders in QCD-like theories in which all quark masses are asymptotically large. Mechanisms for generating hadron-hadron bound states are identified, which necessarily involve large quark-mass hierarchies, relativistic effects arising from the presence of sufficiently light quarks, or nonperturbative effects outside the scope of weakly-coupled pNRQCD.</description>

      <title>A Prediction for Maximum Supercooling in SU(N) Confinement Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal confinement phase transition (PT) in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is first-order for $N\geq 3$, with bounce action scaling as $N^2$. Remarkably, lattice data for the action include a small coefficient whose presence likely strongly alters the PT dynamics. We give evidence, utilizing insights from softly-broken SUSY YM models, that the small coefficient originates from a deconfined phase instability just below the critical temperature. We predict the maximum achievable supercooling in $SU(N)$ theories to be a few percent, which can be tested on the lattice. We briefly discuss the potentially significant suppression of the associated cosmological gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy spin-$\frac {3}{2} $ baryons spectrum in the ground and excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs QCD sum rules to predict the masses and residues of spin-$\frac {3}{2} $ doubly heavy baryons including two heavy quarks (c and/or b) and one light quark, specifically focusing on $ \Xi_{cc}^*$, $ \Xi_{bc}^*$, $ \Xi_{bb}^*$, $ \Omega_{cc}^*$, $ \Omega_{bc}^*$ and $ \Omega_{bb}^*$. Our study provides results for the ground state ($1S$), first orbital excitation ($1P$), and the first radial excitation ($2S$), within a consistent theoretical framework. In addition to mass spectra, we provide residue calculations as well. The calculated residues are essential for estimating the decay widths and branching ratios of these baryons at different decay channels. Our analysis incorporates nonperturbative QCD effects through operators up to dimension ten, leading to improved precision in the mass and residue calculations. These predictions offer crucial guidance for ongoing and future experimental searches, particularly in light of the current lack of empirical data for the ground and excited states, and provide a basis for comparison with future experimental data.</description>

      <title>Extending DD-$\alpha$AMG on heterogeneous machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multigrid solvers are the standard in modern scientific computing simulations. Domain Decomposition Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid, also known as the DD-$\alpha$AMG solver, is a successful realization of an algebraic multigrid solver for lattice quantum chromodynamics. Its CPU implementation has made it possible to construct, for some particular discretizations, simulations otherwise computationally unfeasible, and furthermore it has motivated the development and improvement of other algebraic multigrid solvers in the area. From an existing version of DD-$\alpha$AMG already partially ported via CUDA to run some finest-level operations of the multigrid solver on Nvidia GPUs, we translate the CUDA code here by using HIP to run on the ORISE supercomputer. We moreover extend the smoothers available in DD-$\alpha$AMG, paying particular attention to Richardson smoothing, which in our numerical experiments has led to a multigrid solver faster than smoothing with GCR and only 10% slower compared to SAP smoothing. Then we port the odd-even-preconditioned versions of GMRES and Richardson via CUDA. Finally, we extend some computationally intensive coarse-grid operations via advanced vectorization.</description>

      <title>Detecting spacelike vacuum entanglement at all distances and promoting negativity to a necessary and sufficient entanglement measure in many-body regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though known to be present, the accessibility of spacelike vacuum entanglement capable of being a fundamental resource for quantum information processing has remained in question at distances beyond the scale of vacuum fluctuations in massive fields. For a broad subclass of physical many-body mixed Gaussian states, including the free scalar field vacuum, the logarithmic negativity is here shown to be a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement and to be entirely accessible by pairs of single-mode detectors in the continuum. By deriving exact and optimal detection profiles, entanglement resources in the massive field are demonstrated to be available at all distances.</description>
