      <title>Advanced Superdirective Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superdirective (supergain) antennas aim to produce a narrow main beam from radiators that are electrically small compared with the wavelength. Instead of enlarging the physical aperture, they rely on strongly coupled currents, near-field energy storage, and controlled modal interference so that a compact structure radiates with enhanced directivity. This review emphasizes link-relevant evaluation and reporting: realized gain referenced to a stated impedance plane, clearly stated bandwidth definitions (impedance and performance), and robustness to fabrication spread and platform/environmental loading. Two practical implementation routes are surveyed. The first uses resonant, tightly coupled arrays, including fully driven arrays and single-chain designs based on parasitic or reactively loaded elements. The second uses single-body radiators that enforce a targeted mixture of multipoles or resonant/characteristic modes with one or a few feeds, including symmetry-broken dielectric resonators and mixed electric--magnetic designs. Across RF, microwave, and optical regimes, the same penalties recur as superdirectivity is pushed: reduced radiation resistance, rapid impedance variation, narrow usable bandwidth, and strong sensitivity to small perturbations. Beyond geometric synthesis and multi-resonant stacking, the review highlights emerging levers that can shift these trade-offs in specific system contexts: low-loss materials and cryogenic operation to improve efficiency and frequency stability, and time-varying loading and matching (Floquet/parametric approaches) that can relax linear time-invariant bandwidth constraints, at the cost of added control complexity and spectral conversion.</description>

      <title>A universal waveguide mass--energy relation for lossy one-dimensional waves in nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite, lossy waveguides are ubiquitous: distributed attenuation with partial reflections produces feedback, resonance, delays and decay across electromagnetic, acoustic, photonic, quantum-transport and electrochemical interfaces. Yet standard impedance/scattering tools and weak-loss resonator approximations do not provide low-dimensional invariants that remain predictive under intrinsic asymmetry and realistic boundaries, nor do they cleanly separate total absorption from useful power delivered to a load. Here we develop a unified mass--energy framework for linear, single-mode, one-dimensional systems, in which energy-like and power-flow variables $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S})$ satisfy the universal invariant $\mathcal{U}^2-\mathcal{S}^2=|\Gamma_g|^2$, with the effective standing-wave ``mass'' $|\Gamma_g|$ becoming state-dependent under asymmetry. The Cai--Smith chart gives a bounded state-space map of stability, feedback proximity and operating states, and makes explicit the divergence between maximum absorption and useful delivery under loss. We derive four laws governing absorption and emission, validate the invariant in multiport optics via coherent perfect absorption at exceptional points using a basis-independent SVD criterion (reconciling quadratic vs quartic near-zero scaling), and map electrochemical polarization onto the same geometry by extracting $|\Gamma_g|$ from two-mode orthogonal fits to reveal a universal storage-to-transfer transition across pH. This framework provides a transferable design language for dissipative, boundary-controlled systems.</description>

      <title>Massive coherent equipartition of light by the geometric phase of null space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light source is a foundational to photonic science and technology. However, a significant challenge remains in generating and distributing coherent light from a single on-chip source with high phase stability across multiple channels. Integrated lasers typically operate independently, and conventional splitters (e.g., multi-mode interferometers) do not guarantee the phase coherence required for advanced applications. Here, we report a purely geometric scheme for achieving massive equipartition of coherent light on a photonic chip by leveraging the geometric phases of a null space spanned by degenerate states with zero eigenvalue. The evolution of the null space maps to real-space rotation described by the special orthogonal group SO(N), thus enabling precise and scalable control over light distribution by engineering the system parameters. We experimentally realize up to one-to-nine equipartition of light on a waveguide array fabricated on a glass-based photonic chip. The framework can be upscaled for one-to-N light distribution. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for integrated coherent light sources, paving the way for integrated photonic applications such as quantum photonics and optical computing.</description>

      <title>Impact of aberrations in SLM-based far-field holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use camera-in-the-loop calibration to calibrate a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) in a far-field hologram setup. The recorded intensity distributions achieve a high degree of consistency with the calculated results, indicating a precise calibration and sufficient modeling of the most prominent aberrations. In this work, we discuss the modeled aberrations and examine the improvement or loss in image quality and diffraction efficiency that is obtained by including or excluding the modeled aberrations in the calibration. We further show the influence of aberrations on speckle-reduced holograms and evaluate the speckle contrast.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of localization in a finite harmonically confined optical superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of harmonic confinement in a finite optical superlattice and reveal the different mechanisms that can lead to the emergence of localized states. The optical superlattice, with odd or even number of unit cells, can exhibit either a trivial or a non-trivial underlying topology, characterized by the corresponding Zak phase. We focus on a distinct localization mechanism in the intermediate harmonic trapping frequency regime. Specifically, the four lowest-lying eigenstates in this regime form an effective four-level system in the topologically non-trivial configuration. Larger trapping frequency values drive the system into a harmonic trap dominated regime, featuring classical pairing and localization of all states of the lower band, as in a usual optical lattice. For the lower trapping frequency regime, the fate of topological edge states is discussed. Our results are based on exact diagonalization and on a tight-binding approximation that maps the continuous to a discrete system. We address several aspects relevant to the experimental implementation of optical superlattices and provide a brief illustration of the dynamics, highlighting direct ways to observe and distinguish between the different localization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Topological robustness of optical skyrmions through a real-world free-space link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light offers a promising solution for the increasing data demands of modern optical networks, opening up new degrees of freedom that can be leveraged for greater channel capacity and more bits per photon. However, its implementation is hindered by real-world distortions, for example, atmospheric turbulence in free-space, with severe and rapidly evolving phase perturbations that alter the amplitude, phase and vectorial polarization structure of the beam. Here, we demonstrate that optical topologies in the form of skyrmions are highly resilient to the effects of real-world atmospheric turbulence. We create and transmit these particle-like topologies of light through a 270~m free-space optical link, revealing their robustness across a wide variety of conditions and turbulence strengths. While we observe severe distortion in the states' underlying degrees of freedom, we show that the topological numbers are preserved in all cases. We account for fast changes to the medium, where the channel produces statistically averaged outcomes, by probing the state's decoherence, showing that while the degree of polarisation consequently decays, the topology remains intact. Using topology, we show information can be transmitted through the channel with almost perfect fidelity (&gt;98%) in most cases, only decreasing to 86% in the most severe conditions tested. Our work is the first to demonstrate the potential for optical topologies as reliable and robust information carriers in a real-world environment and points to the potential for other complex channels too, offering attractive features for classical and quantum communication alike.</description>

      <title>Passive Incoherent Ultrafast Mid-Infrared Upconversion Imaging and Its Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast mid-infrared (MIR) imaging is a key enabling capability for monitoring transient thermal and plasma phenomena in scientific diagnostics and industrial safety. However, conventional cryogenic MIR cameras face a fundamental trade-off between frame rate, noise, and pixel format. Here we report a passive, incoherent MIR imaging platform that leverages sum-frequency upconversion in chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPLN) to translate broadband 3--5um scenes to the near-infrared, enabling ultrafast acquisition on a silicon-based intensified CCD (iCCD). In fast-kinetics mode we achieve a physical frame rate of 100kHz with microsecond-scale gate control, and we directly capture the full evolution of an air-breakdown electric arc, resolving its rapid ignition, expansion, and decay dynamics. Beyond demonstrating ultrafast passive imaging, we introduce a drift-aware calibration workflow based on Allan deviation analysis to quantitatively select the gate width and averaging strategy under realistic slow-drift and multiplicative noise. This combined capability -- ultrafast passive MIR imaging plus operationally meaningful calibration -- provides a practical route toward real-time thermal surveillance and early-warning systems for hazardous fast transients.</description>

      <title>PhoQuPy: A Python framework for Automation of Quantum Optics experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the automation of a confocal photoluminescence (PL) scanning system for the identification and characterization of single-photon emitters (SPEs) in quantum materials. The setup excites the sample with a laser and acquires a spectrum at each spatial coordinate in a raster scan pattern. A double-acquisition method is used to remove cosmic ray artifacts by comparing subsequent measurements at the same spatial coordinate. Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission. The system integrates Python-based hardware control for motorized stages, spectrometer acquisition, and post-processing, with a migration to a galvo-mirror scanning approach for using it along with a cryostat for low temperature measurements. Our results demonstrate spatially resolved PL maps and temperature-dependent spectra, highlighting the capability of the setup to efficiently benchmark SPE performance. We further went on to perform automation of other experiments such as a Non-Linear Interferometry setup for Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and a Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy using a common path birefringence Interferometer to obtain hyperspectral images of our samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This industrial Ph.D. project, carried out in collaboration between Radiometer Medical ApS and SDU Centre for Photonics Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark, explored the use of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) for the purposes of differential white blood cell counts (dWBCs) in point-of-care (PoC) devices for acute care settings. Two DHM prototypes were developed; an initial lens-based system serving as the foundation for algorithm development, and experimental validation of the approach, achieving 89.6% classification accuracy on a 3-part differential, and a subsequent lensless system for simplified design and increased field-of-view (FoV). Both prototypes employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cell classification. With further optimizations, the lensless system achieved classification accuracies of 92.65% and 89.44% on the 3-part and 5-part differential, respectively. With the lensless system, the derivation of the monocyte distribution width (MDW), a biomarker for sepsis, was also demonstrated.
  Additionally, pixel super-resolution and multi-wavelength DHM approaches were investigated to enhance the obtained cell information. Finally, a proof-of-principle physics-informed neural network (PINN) for holographic reconstruction was implemented, demonstrating the potential for machine learning (ML) reconstruction techniques.
  In summary, this work represents an initial exploration of DHM for dWBC in PoC devices, laying the groundwork for future research.</description>

      <title>Photo-birefringent effects in crystalline AlGaAs mirror coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-reflective crystalline $GaAs/Al_{0.92}Ga_{0.08}As$ coatings show reduced Brownian noise compared to conventional dielectric coatings. However, several ultra stable laser systems observed additional noise sources that hinder the realization of the expected improvements in frequency stability. These additional noise sources are related to the birefringence of the coatings and its modification by intracavity light. The origin of the birefringence is not yet well understood and its modification via illumination remains unexplained. Here we present an extensive study on the steady-state and transient modification of the birefringence by intracavity light and by uniform illumination at various wavelengths using an optical cavity at room temperature. We find a unified description that suggests a primary two-photon process for photon energies below the bandgap of GaAs, or a single-photon process at higher energies. Adding external illumination allows to reduce noise induced by laser power fluctuations by balancing the photo-thermal-optic response of the mirrors and the photo-birefringent effect at a more favorable low intracavity power.</description>

      <title>ConvRML: High-Quality Lensless Imaging with Random Multi-Focal Lenslets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mask-based lensless imagers use simple optics and computational reconstruction to design compact form factor cameras with compressive imaging ability. However, these imagers generally suffer from poor reconstruction quality. Here, we describe several advances in both hardware and software that result in improved lensless imaging quality. First, we use a precision-manufactured random multi-focal lenslet (RML) phase mask to produce improved measurements with reduced multiplexing. Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information. Our ConvRML system benefits from both the optical and the computational developments presented in this work, and our contributions establish resources to support continued development of high-quality, compact, and compressive lensless imagers.</description>

      <title>Coherent electronic Raman excitation of valley-orbit split states of phosphorus dopants in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate coherent optical excitation of the electronic Raman transition between the $1s\left(A_1\right)$ and $1s\left(E\right)$ split states of phosphorus donor in crystalline silicon. The dynamics of the generated wavepacket is characterized in the time domain using a degenerate pump-probe technique with mid-infrared femtosecond pulses via transient polarization anisotropy of the probe pulse. In addition, we study the role of resonantly excited carriers, and we show that the amplitude and coherence time of the electronic wavepacket depend on the pre-excited carrier density. Further, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, the Raman-type excitation changes to displacive impulsive excitation, which allows us to address the Raman-forbidden transition between $1s\left(A_1\right)$ and $1s\left(T_1\right)$.</description>

      <title>Photon statistics of resonantly driven spectrally diffusive quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the solid state, a large variety of single-photon emitters present high quality photophysical properties together with a potential for integration. However, in many cases, the host matrix induces fluctuations of the emission wavelength in time, limiting the potential applications based on indistinguishable photons. A deep understanding of the underlying spectral diffusion processes is therefore of high importance for improving the stability of the light emission. Here, we theoretically investigate the photon statistics of an emitter driven by a resonant laser, and subject to either of two qualitatively different stationary spectral diffusion processes - a continuous diffusion process and a process based on discrete spectral jumps, both of which being known to model the spectral diffusion of various solid-state emitters. We show that the statistics of light emission carries several experimentally accessible signatures that allow to discriminate between the two classes of models, both at short times in the intensity correlation function, and at long times in the fluctuations of the integrated intensity. These results establish that resonant excitation combined with photon statistics offers a rich access to the spectral diffusion processes, yielding information that goes beyond the bare characterization of the inhomogeneous shape and noise correlation time. Incidentally, our findings shed a new light on recent experimental results of spectral diffusion of B centers in hexagonal boron nitride, providing more insight in their spectral diffusion mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the spatio temporal weak measurement of a chiral ultrafast optical pulse. We create a chiral vector wave packet by transmitting ultrashort laser pulse via a birefringent or magneto-optic medium. Employing time-resolved leakage radiation microscopy, we examine how the real and imaginary components of the weak value parameter ($\epsilon$) influence pulse propagation over time. Our technique allows us to detect and categorize the temporal polarization fluctuation in a $75$ fs pulse with an excellent repeatability. The achieved experimental results demonstrate a satisfactory consistency with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Electron Pulse Shaper</title>

Abstract: Coherent control of ultrafast quantum phenomena benefits from pulse-shaping capabilities allowing to modulate the envelope and instantaneous phase of optical fields on femtosecond time scales. While such control is available for optical fields, an analogy of a pulse shaper for freely propagating electrons is lacking. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate a method that enables near arbitrary light-based shaping of electron wave packets in the time domain. The method is based on the quantum phase modulation of electron waves by coherent light with time-dependent frequency leading to generation of spectrally separated electron energy side bands with shaped time-energy profiles and envelopes. Our results show that few femtosecond time durations can be achieved without additional spectral broadening of the electron wave packet, allowing one to reach the combination of high time, spatial, and spectral resolutions in ultrafast imaging and diffraction experiments with pulsed electron beams.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Hybrid Quantum Cryptography for Submarine Optical Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multichannel hybrid quantum cryptography approach intended for submarine quantum optical communications between Alice and Bob separated a distance beyond the current QKD possibilities, each located on a coastline. It is based on the difficult of a simultaneous access to $M$ optical submarine channels. The optical lines from the coastline and ideally to the end of the continental platform are governed by the quantum properties of the light under an autocompensating high-dimensional discrete-modulation continuous variable QKD protocol. The hybrid approach consists of combining several secret keys of the $M$ channels and introducing extra layers of security, passive and/or active, on the non quantum optical lines located beyond the continental platform.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Time-Domain Simulation of Complex Photonic Structures with a Data-Aware Fourier Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate time-domain simulation of electromagnetic fields in complex photonic devices is critical for designing broadband and ultrafast optical components, yet it is often limited by the high computational cost of conventional numerical methods like FDTD. While machine learning approaches show promise in accelerating these simulations, existing models still struggle to simultaneously capture the dynamic field evolution and generalize to complex geometries. In this paper, we introduce a Data-Aware Fourier Neural Operator (DA-FNO) as an innovative neural operator for solving electromagnetic simulations. Applied autoregressively, the model iteratively predicts the time-domain evolution of all field components and automatically terminates upon energy convergence. Our model not only generalizes to complex and randomized geometries but also shows good predictive consistency across the optical C-band (1530-1565nm) when evaluated on the test set. In a representative configuration, it achieves an 11* speedup over conventional methods while maintaining about 95% accuracy across the C-band. This approach provides a new pathway for C-band photonic simulations, potentially facilitating the research, development, and inverse design of novel photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Fractional-order Fourier transformations as pseudo-differential operators. Applications to diffraction and imaging by optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular and hyperbolic fractional-order Fourier transformations are actually Weyl pseudo-differential operators. Their associated kernels and symbols are written explicitly. Products of fractional-order Fourier transformations are obtained by composing their kernels or symbols, in accordance with the Weyl calculus. On the other hand, optical field transfers by diffraction, from spherical emitters to receivers, are mathematically expressed using fractional-order Fourier transforms and are classified into three categories, for which we provide geometrical characterizations. Respecting the Huygens-Fresnel principle requires that the associated transformations be adequately composed, which is achieved through the composition rules of pseudo-differential operators. By applying the Weyl calculus, we prove that, in general, imaging through a refracting spherical cap can be described as the composition of two fractional-order Fourier transformations, but only if those transformations are of the same kind. Basic laws of coherent geometrical imaging are thus deduced from the composition of two circular fractional-order Fourier transformations. We also prove that the arrangement of a sequence of points along the axis of a centered optical system is preserved by imaging, up to a circular permutation. This recovers a classical result from geometrical optics, but here it is derived within the framework of diffraction theory.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Phase Prediction in Digital Lasers Using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital lasers control the laser beam by dynamically updating the phase patterns of the spatial light modulator (SLM) within the laser cavity. Due to the presence of nonlinear effects, such as mode competition and gain saturation in digital laser systems, it is often necessary to rely on specifically manually tailored approach or iteration processes to find suitable loaded phases in Digital lasers. This study proposes a model based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) and a modified U-Net architecture, with designed loss functions to inverse design the loaded phases. In this work, we employ deep neural networks to learn the nonlinear effects in simulated L-shape digital lasers, enabling the prediction of SLM-loaded phases for both analytical and non-analytical arbitrary structured light fields. The results demonstrate superior performance on non-analytical light fields compared to the current methods in L-shape Digital lasers. Furthermore, a transfer learning strategy is introduced, allowing knowledge obtained from one class of structured beams to be effectively reused for another, thereby enhancing generalization and improving performance under limited training data. Importantly, this method, the first proposed learning framework for digital lasers, is not limited to the L-shaped digital lasers discussed in this study, providing an efficient alternative for generating structured light in other digital laser systems.</description>

      <title>Study on Light Propagation through Space-Time Random Media via Stochastic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, the theory of stochastic partial differential equations is applied to the propagation of light fields in space-time random media. By modeling the fluctuation of refractive index's square of the media as a random field, we demonstrate that the hyperbolic Anderson model is applicable to describing the propagation of light fields in such media. Additionally, several new quantitative characterizations of the stochastic properties that govern the light fields are derived. Furthermore, the validity of the theoretical framework and corresponding results is experimentally verified by analyzing the statistical properties of the propagated light fields after determining the spatial and temporal stochastic features of the random media. The results presented here provide a more accurate theoretical basis for better understanding random phenomena in emerging domains such as free-space optical communication, detection, and imaging in transparent random media. The study could also have practical guiding significance for experimental system design in these fields.</description>

      <title>Broadband silicon polarization beam splitter based on Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A broadband silicon polarization beam splitter (PBS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on Floquet-engineered directional couplers. The total length of the coupling structure is 20 um . By periodically modulating the waveguide width of the directional couplers, the power exchange between the two waveguides for the transverse-electric (TE) mode is suppressed, whereas the power coupling for the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode is enhanced. The fabricated PBS exhibits polarization extinction ratios (PERs) &gt; 20 dB for both polarizations over a broad wavelength range of 1483 nm-1620 nm. Additionally, the measured insertion losses (ILs) are 0.15 dB and 1.2 dB at 1550 nm for TE and TM polarizations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Enhanced Amplified Spontaneous Emission in Solvent-Engineered MAPbBr$_3$ Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-pressure behavior of 3D metal halide chalcogenides (MHPs) has been widely studied. In the field of high-pressure technology, the studies on 3D MHPs have focused on the structural and optical properties, where the optical properties are mainly investigated on the photoluminescence behavior, while the laser properties of the materials have not been studied yet. In this paper, MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films with ionic liquid methylammonium acetate (MAAc) as solvent and conventional MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents were prepared using solvent engineering method. In-situ pressurization testing of both materials using a small-cavity hydrostatic high-pressure device (DAC) was used to investigate the high-pressure optical behavior of the MAPbBr$_3$ films, especially the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties, which, combined with high-pressure in-situ Raman, revealed that the changes in the optical properties of the films under pressure are due to the changes in the crystal structure of the materials. This paper also emphasizes that the optical properties and phase structure stability of MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films are superior to those of MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Critical re-examination of a claimed challenge of Bohmian mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent experiment by Sharoglazova {\it et al.} was interpreted by the authors as a challenge to the basic idea of Bohmian mechanics, the phase-velocity relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, we reinterpret their experiment, highlighting the role of the transient regime before the onset of the stationary state. In this way, we show that the experimental data can naturally fit the Bohmian framework when the energy in the evanescent regime is identified with the quantum potential. It is, however, also possible to interpret the same energy as a kinetic energy, in the framework of Nelson's stochastic quantum mechanics. In conclusion, far from challenging the Bohmian mechanics, we find that the experimental results of Sharoglazova {\it et al.} can be interpreted in either ontologies and are therefore not conclusive in selecting one or the other.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Learning of the Wave Speed Landscape in Complex Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave velocity is a key parameter for imaging complex media, but in vivo measurements are typically limited to reflection geometries, where only backscattered waves from short-scale heterogeneities are accessible. As a result, conventional reflection imaging fails to recover large-scale variations of the wave velocity landscape. Here we show that matrix imaging overcomes this limitation by exploiting the quality of wave focusing as an intrinsic guide star. We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured.</description>

      <title>Reducing acquisition time and radiation damage: data-driven subsampling for spectro-microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectro-microscopy is an experimental technique which can be used to observe spatial variations in chemical state and changes in chemical state over time or under experimental conditions. As a result it has broad applications across areas such as energy materials, catalysis, environmental science and biological samples. However, the technique is often limited by factors such as long acquisition times and radiation damage. We present two measurement strategies that allow for significantly shorter experiment times and total doses applied. The strategies are based on taking only a small subset of all the measurements (e.g. sparse acquisition or subsampling), and then computationally reconstructing all unobserved measurements using mathematical techniques. The methods are data-driven, using spectral and spatial importance subsampling distributions to identify important measurements. As a result, taking as little as 4-6\% of the measurements is sufficient to capture the same information as in a conventional scan.</description>
