      <title>Parity and time-reversal symmetry violation in diatomic molecules: LaO, LaS and LuO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry is enhanced in the LaS, LaO and LuO molecules due to the existence of states of opposite parity with small energy differences and the presence of heavy nuclei. We calculate the molecular enhancement for the P, T-violating electron electric dipole moment ($W_{\mathrm{d}}$), scalar-pseudoscalar nucleon-electron interaction ($W_{\mathrm{s}}$), nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment ($W_{\mathrm{M}}$), and for the nuclear spin-dependent P-violating anapole moment ($W_{\mathrm{A}}$). We use the relativistic 4-components coupled cluster method and perform a systematic study to estimate the associated uncertainties in our approach. We find that the individual contribution of each computational parameter to the total uncertainty in a system is approximately the same for all the calculated enhancement factors, summing up to a total uncertainty of $\sim7$\%. We discuss the energy shifts and matrix elements associated with the calculated molecular enhancement factors and relate them to higher-energy P- and P, T- violating interactions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic trapping of an ultracold $^{39}$K-$^{40}$K mixture with a versatile potassium laser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dual isotope magneto-optical trap (MOT), simultaneous sub-Doppler laser cooling, and magnetic trapping of a spin-polarized $^{39}$K-$^{40}$K Bose-Fermi mixture realized in a single-chamber setup with an unenriched potassium dispenser as the source of atoms. We are able to magnetically confine more than $2.2\times10^5$ fermions ($F=9/2\,m_F=9/2$) and $1.4\times10^7$ bosons ($F=2\,m_F=2$) with a lifetime exceeding 1.2 s. For this work, we have developed a versatile laser tailored for sub-Doppler cooling of all naturally occurring potassium isotopes and their mixtures. This laser system incorporates innovative features, such as the capability to select an isotope by activating or deactivating specific acousto-optic modulators that control the light seeding tapered amplifiers. Switching between isotopes takes $\sim$1 $\mathrm{\mu}$s without any mechanical adjustment of the components. As a final step in characterizing the laser system, we demonstrate sub-Doppler cooling of $^{41}$K.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <title>Study of bound and resonant states of NS molecule in the R-matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bound and resonance states along with corresponding autoionization widths for nitrogen sulphide (NS) molecule are determined using electron NS$^+$ cation scattering calculations. The calculations are performed for $^2{\Sigma}^+$, $^2{\Pi}$ and $^2\Delta$ total symmetries using the ab initio R-matrix method for both bound and continuum states. Calculations are performed on a grid of 106 points for internuclear separations between 1.32 and 3 $\AA$. The resonance states yield dissociative potential curves which, when considered together with their widths, provide input for models of different electron-cation collision processes including dissociative recombination, and rotational and vibrational excitation. Curves and couplings which will lead directly to dissociative recombination are identified.</description>

      <title>Dissociative recombination of the CH$^+$ molecular ion at low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reactive collisions of the CH$^+$ molecular ion with electrons is studied in the framework of the multichannel quantum defect theory, taking into account the contribution of the core-excited Rydberg states. In addition to the $X^1\Sigma^+$ ground state of the ion, we also consider the contribution to the dynamics of the $a^3\Pi$ and $A^1\Pi$ excited states of CH$^+$. Our results - in the case of the dissociative recombination in good agreement with the storage ring measurements - rely on decisive improvements - complete account of the ionisation channels and accurate evaluation of the reaction matrix - of a previously used model.</description>

      <title>Towards a zero magnetic field environment for ultracold atoms experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimization of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in ultracold gas research. For instance, the contact interaction dominates all the other energy scales in the zero magnetic field limit, giving rise to novel quantum phases of matter. However, lowering magnetic fields well below the mG level is often challenging in ultracold gas experiments. In this article, we apply Landau-Zener spectroscopy to characterize and reduce the magnetic field on an ultracold gas of sodium atoms to a few tens of {\mu}G. The lowest magnetic field achieved here opens to observing novel phases of matter with ultracold spinor Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Self-diffusion in a strongly coupled non-neutral plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a joint experimental and theoretical approach to measure the self-diffusion in a laser-cooled trapped ion cloud where part of the ions are shelved in a long-lived dark state. The role of the self-diffusion coefficient in the spatial organisation of the ions is deciphered, following from the good agreement between the experimental observations and the theoretical predictions. This comparison furthermore allows to deduce the temperature of the sample. Protocols to measure the self-diffusion coefficient are discussed, in regard with the control that can be reached on the relevant time scales through the dressing of the atomic levels by laser fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to directly laser cool Rydberg atoms by laser cooling the residual ion core within the Rydberg-electron orbit. The scheme is detailed for alkaline-earth-metal Rydberg atoms, whose ions can be easily laser cooled. We demonstrate that a closed optical cooling cycle can be found despite the perturbations caused by the Rydberg electron, and that this cycle can be driven over more than $100~\mu$s to achieve laser cooling. The cooling dynamics with and without the presence of magnetic fields are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Understanding inner-shell excitations in molecules through spectroscopy of the 4f hole states of YbF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules containing a lanthanide atom have sets of electronic states arising from excitation of an inner-shell electron. These states have received little attention, but are thought to play an important role in laser cooling of such molecules and may be a useful resource for testing fundamental physics. We study a series of inner-shell excited states in YbF using resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionisation spectroscopy. We investigate the excited states of lowest energy, 8474, 9013 and 9090 cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state, all corresponding to the configuration 4f$^{13}$6s$^{2}$ ${}^{2}F_{7/2}$ of the Yb$^+$ ion. They are metastable, since they have no electric dipole allowed transitions to the ground state. We also characterize a state at 31050 cm$^{-1}$ that is easily excited from both the ground and metastable states, which makes it especially useful for this spectroscopic study. Finally, we study a state at 48729 cm$^{-1}$, which is above the ionization limit and features strong auto-ionizing resonances that prove useful for efficient detection of the molecules and for identifying the rotational quantum number of each line in the spectrum. We resolve the rotational structures of all these states and find that they can all be described by a very simple model based on Hund's case (c). Our study provides information necessary for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping of YbF, which is an important species for testing fundamental physics. We also consider whether the low-lying inner-shell states may themselves be useful as probes of the electron's electric dipole moment or of varying fundamental constants, since they are long-lived states in a laser-coolable molecule featuring closely-spaced levels of opposite parity.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Time Crystal in Driven-Dissipative Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous time crystals (CTCs) are characterized by sustained oscillations that break the time translation symmetry. Since the ruling out of equilibrium CTCs by no-go theorems, the emergence of such dynamical phases has been observed in various driven-dissipative quantum platforms. The current understanding of CTCs is mainly based on mean-field (MF) theories, which fail to address the problem of whether the long-range time crystalline order exists in noisy, spatially extended systems without the protection of all-to-all couplings. Here, we propose a new kind of CTC realized in a quantum contact model through self-organized bistability (SOB). The exotic CTCs stem from the interplay between collective dissipation induced by the first-order absorbing phase transitions (APTs) and slow constant driving provided by an incoherent pump. The stability of such oscillatory phases in finite dimensions under the action of intrinsic quantum fluctuations is scrutinized by the functional renormalization group method and numerical simulations. Occurring at the edge of quantum synchronization, the CTC phase exhibits an inherent period and amplitude with a coherence time diverging with system size, thus also constituting a boundary time crystal (BTC). Our results serve as a solid route towards self-protected CTCs in strongly interacting open systems.</description>

      <title>Universality for Three Bosons with Large, Negative Effective Range: Aspects and Addenda</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resummed-Range Effective Field Theory is the consistent non-relativistic Effective Field Theory of point interactions in systems with large two-body scattering length $a$ and an effective range $r_0$ large in magnitude but negative. Its leading order is non-perturbative, and its observables depend only on the dimensionless ratio $\xi:=2r_0/a$ once $|r_0|$ is chosen as base unit. This presentation highlights aspects for three identical spinless bosons and adds details to a previous discussion [1]. At leading order, no three-body interaction is needed. A ground state exists only in the range $0.366\ldots\ge\xi\ge-8.72\ldots$, and excited states display self-similarity and Discrete Scale Invariance, with small corrections for nonzero $r_0$.</description>

      <title>Two-axis twisting using Floquet-engineered XYZ spin models with polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polar molecules confined in an optical lattice are a versatile platform to explore spin-motion dynamics based on strong, long-range dipolar interactions. The precise tunability of Ising and spin-exchange interactions with both microwave and dc electric fields makes the molecular system particularly suitable for engineering complex many-body dynamics. Here, we used Floquet engineering to realize interesting quantum many-body systems of polar molecules. Using a spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states of ultracold KRb molecules, we mutually validated XXZ spin models tuned by a Floquet microwave pulse sequence against those tuned by a dc electric field through observations of Ramsey contrast dynamics, setting the stage for the realization of Hamiltonians inaccessible with static fields. In particular, we observed two-axis twisting mean-field dynamics, generated by a Floquet-engineered XYZ model using itinerant molecules in 2D layers. In the future, Floquet-engineered Hamiltonians could generate entangled states for molecule-based precision measurement or could take advantage of the rich molecular structure for quantum simulation of multi-level systems.</description>
