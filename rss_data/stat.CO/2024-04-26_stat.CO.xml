      <title>Generalized Posterior Calibration via Sequential Monte Carlo Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For robustness toward model misspecification, the generalized posterior inference approach modifies the likelihood term by raising it to the power of a learning rate, thereby adjusting the spread of the posterior. This paper proposes a computationally efficient strategy for selecting an appropriate learning rate. The proposed approach builds upon the generalized posterior calibration (GPC) algorithm introduced by Syring and Martin (2019) [Biometrika, Volume 106, Issue 2, pp. 479-486], which is designed to select the learning rate to achieve the nominal frequentist coverage. This algorithm, which evaluates the coverage probability based on bootstrap samples, suffers from high computational costs due to the need for repeated posterior simulations for bootstrap samples. To address this limitation, the study proposes an algorithm that combines elements of the GPC algorithm with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler. By leveraging the similarity between the learning rate in generalized posterior inference and the inverse temperature in SMC sampling, the proposed algorithm efficiently calibrates the posterior distribution with less computational cost. For demonstration, the proposed algorithm was applied to several statistical learning models.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spatial Context: A Comprehensive Bibliography of GWR and MGWR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local spatial models such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) serve as instrumental tools to capture intrinsic contextual effects through the estimates of the local intercepts and behavioral contextual effects through estimates of the local slope parameters. GWR and MGWR provide simple implementation yet powerful frameworks that could be extended to various disciplines that handle spatial data. This bibliography aims to serve as a comprehensive compilation of peer-reviewed papers that have utilized GWR or MGWR as a primary analytical method to conduct spatial analyses and acts as a useful guide to anyone searching the literature for previous examples of local statistical modeling in a wide variety of application fields.</description>

      <title>On Neighbourhood Cross Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown how to efficiently and accurately compute and optimize a range of cross validation criteria for a wide range of models estimated by minimizing a quadratically penalized smooth loss. Example models include generalized additive models for location scale and shape and smooth additive quantile regression. Example losses include negative log likelihoods and smooth quantile losses. Example cross validation criteria include leave-out-neighbourhood cross validation for dealing with un-modelled short range autocorrelation as well as the more familiar leave-one-out cross validation. For a $p$ coefficient model of $n$ data, estimable at $O(np^2)$ computational cost, the general $O(n^2p^2)$ cost of ordinary cross validation is reduced to $O(np^2)$, computing the cross validation criterion to $O(p^3n^{-2})$ accuracy. This is achieved by directly approximating the model coefficient estimates under data subset omission, via efficiently computed single step Newton updates of the full data coefficient estimates. Optimization of the resulting cross validation criterion, with respect to multiple smoothing/precision parameters, can be achieved efficiently using quasi-Newton optimization, adapted to deal with the indefiniteness that occurs when the optimal value for a smoothing parameter tends to infinity. The link between cross validation and the jackknife can be exploited to achieve reasonably well calibrated uncertainty quantification for the model coefficients in non standard settings such as leaving-out-neighbourhoods under residual autocorrelation or quantile regression. Several practical examples are provided, focussing particularly on dealing with un-modelled auto-correlation.</description>

      <title>Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for Stationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time. In particular, for a Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate direct solves with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Variable Selection for Function-on-Scalar Regression Models: a comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we developed a new Bayesian method for variable selection in function-on-scalar regression (FOSR). Our method uses a hierarchical Bayesian structure and latent variables to enable an adaptive covariate selection process for FOSR. Extensive simulation studies show the proposed method's main properties, such as its accuracy in estimating the coefficients and high capacity to select variables correctly. Furthermore, we conducted a substantial comparative analysis with the main competing methods, the BGLSS (Bayesian Group Lasso with Spike and Slab prior) method, the group LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), the group MCP (Minimax Concave Penalty), and the group SCAD (Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation). Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is superior in correctly selecting covariates compared with the existing competing methods while maintaining a satisfactory level of goodness of fit. In contrast, the competing methods could not balance selection accuracy with goodness of fit. We also considered a COVID-19 dataset and some socioeconomic data from Brazil as an application and obtained satisfactory results. In short, the proposed Bayesian variable selection model is highly competitive, showing significant predictive and selective quality.</description>

      <title>Consistent, multidimensional differential histogramming and summary statistics with YODA 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histogramming is often taken for granted, but the power and compactness of partially aggregated, multidimensional summary statistics, and their fundamental connection to differential and integral calculus make them formidable statistical objects, especially when very large data volumes are involved. But expressing these concepts robustly and efficiently in high-dimensional parameter spaces and for large data samples is a highly non-trivial challenge -- doubly so if the resulting library is to remain usable by scientists as opposed to software engineers. In this paper we summarise the core principles required for consistent generalised histogramming, and use them to motivate the design principles and implementation mechanics of the re-engineered YODA histogramming library, a key component of physics data-model comparison and statistical interpretation in collider physics.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Particle Filters for Partially Observed McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the filtering problem associated to partially observed McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The model consists of data that are observed at regular and discrete times and the objective is to compute the conditional expectation of (functionals) of the solutions of the SDE at the current time. This problem, even the ordinary SDE case is challenging and requires numerical approximations. Based upon the ideas in [3, 12] we develop a new particle filter (PF) and multilevel particle filter (MLPF) to approximate the afore-mentioned expectations. We prove under assumptions that, for $\epsilon&gt;0$, to obtain a mean square error of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ the PF has a cost per-observation time of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ and the MLPF costs $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ (best case) or $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4}\log(\epsilon)^2)$ (worst case). Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments.</description>
