      <title>Electrostatic toroidal bender and its fringe fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I describe the COSY-Infinity code GES that we have developed and used in various forms in the past 30 years to calculate maps to third order through electrostatic bend elements. It has been a mystery that COSY's in-built procedures ES, ESP and ECL disagreed with our own code. This note is intended to clarify the issue.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Material Effects in Undulator-Based LSW Searches for Dark Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark photon is one of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model and provides a minimal laboratory for quantum-mechanical phenomena. Light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) searches often adopt the dark photon-photon oscillation formula as if the sensitivity were independent of the light source, the wall, and the surrounding medium. In this paper, I revisit an LSW experiment whose light source is an undulator and systematically include various quantum effects: finite wave packets, kinematical suppression due to the microscopic structure of the source, and mixing suppression/enhancement in the wall and the air. We find that the resulting sensitivities deviate significantly from those obtained with the na\"{i}ve oscillation formula, especially depending on the mass of the dark photon, relevant to reflective index of the medium or walls, there can be resonance effects enhancing the sensitivity significantly. Accounting for these effects, we show that placing a photon detector outside the shielding along the beamline of a synchrotron facility enables an economical, parasitic LSW search for dark photons.</description>

      <title>Detuning Properties of RF Phase Modulation in an Electron Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.15555v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electron storage rings, it is possible to increase the bunch length by applying phase modulation to the radio frequency accelerating field by choosing appropriate parameters for the modulation. Such a bunch lengthening effect improves beam parameters such as beam lifetime, which can help us achieve better beam stability. It is well known that the modulation frequency around the double synchrotron frequency is effective in lengthening the bunch. The dependence of bunch lengthening on modulation frequency, the so-called detuning property, has a peak around the double synchrotron frequency with a frequency width that depends on the modulation amplitude. Nonlinear effects due to phase modulation lead to a peak frequency shift in a negative direction from the double synchrotron frequency, accompanied by an asymmetric peak shape. Beam current also affects the properties of the detuning condition of such bunch lengthening. We investigated the detuning property using a theoretical model and systematic measurements at the electron storage ring KARA, and we verified the qualitative agreement between the experiments and the theoretical model. The macro-particle simulations have confirmed the agreement.</description>

      <title>100s TeV/m-Level Particle Accelerators Driven by High-density Electron Beams in Micro Structured Carbon Nanotube Forest Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have the potential to support ultra-high accelerating fields in the TV/m range for charged particle acceleration. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using nanostructured CNTs forest to develop plasma-based accelerators at the 100 TeV/m-level, driven by high-density, ultra-relativistic electron beams, using fully three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Two different acceleration mechanisms are proposed and investigated: the surface plasmon leakage field and the bubble wakefield. The leakage field, driven by a relatively low-density beam, can achieve an acceleration field up to TV/m, capable of accelerating both electron and positron beams. In particular, due to the direct acceleration by the driver beam, the positron acceleration is highly efficient with an average acceleration gradient of 2.3 TeV/m. In contrast, the bubble wakefield mechanism allows significantly higher acceleration fields, e.g. beyond $400~\si{TV/m}$, with a much higher energy transfer efficiency of $66.7\%$. In principle, electrons can be accelerated to PeV energies over distances of several meters. If the beam density is sufficiently high, the CNT target will be completely blown out, where no accelerating field is generated. Its threshold has been estimated. Two major challenges in these schemes are recognised and investigated. Leveraging the ultra-high energy and charge pumping rate of the driver beam, the nanostructured CNTs also offer significant potential for a wide range of advanced applications. This work represents a promising avenue for the development of ultra-compact, high-energy particle accelerators. We also outline conceptual experiments using currently available facilities, demonstrating that this approach is experimentally accessible.</description>
