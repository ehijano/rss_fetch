      <title>A Spectroscopic Search for Dormant Black Holes in Low-Metallicity Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the massive black hole (BH) system Gaia BH3 in pre-release Gaia DR4 data suggests that wide BH binaries with luminous companions may be significantly overrepresented at low metallicities. Motivated by this finding, we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of low-metallicity stars exhibiting elevated RUWE values in Gaia DR3, using the FEROS and APF spectrographs. We identify promising BH binary candidates as objects with instantaneously measured radial velocities (RVs) that are very different from their mean RVs reported in Gaia DR3. Thus far, we have observed over 500 targets, including a nearly complete sample of stars with $\text{[Fe/H]} &lt; -1.5$, RUWE $&gt; 2$, and $G &lt; 15$. Our search has yielded one promising target exhibiting slow acceleration and an RV more than 98 km s$^{-1}$ different from its DR3 mean RV, as well as dozens of other candidates with smaller RV discrepancies. We quantify the sensitivity of our search using simulations, demonstrating that it recovers at least half of the BH companions within our selection criteria. We make all the spectra and RVs from our survey publicly available and encourage further follow-up.</description>

      <title>The vanishing of the long photometric cycle in AU Monocerotis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double periodic variables (DPVs) are a group of semi-detached interacting binaries that exhibit a long photometric cycle with an average length of $\sim33$ times the orbital period of the system. It has been proposed that this long photometric cycle originates from a modulated mass transfer rate from the donor star, which itself is driven by an internal magnetic dynamo. One of the most well-studied DPVs in the Milky Way is AU Monocerotis (AU Mon). We aim to enhance our understanding of the long photometric cycle in AU Mon by characterising its behaviour through the analysis of available photometric data from several databases and surveys. We summarise previous findings on the system and analyse its published multi-wavelength photometry from different sources, covering 46.3 years, to study the variability of its light curve. We find that the orbital period has remained constant over recent decades, but the long cycle of approximately 417 days vanished around 2010. From an O-C analysis, we conclude that the system is experiencing a change in its orbital period of no greater than $0.038\pm0.040$ s yr$^{-1}$, and thus, imposing a value of $2\times10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for $\dot{M}$ in a fully conservative mass transfer regime. A time-series analysis of the disentangling light curve in the Ic filter shows a transient periodicity of approximately 1910 days lasting at least 2000 days before it also disappears around the year 2020. An analysis of the available APASS light curves around the year 2013 shows a strong periodicity at approximately 280 days, which appears to be stronger in the Z filter. We report what is the second observation of the sudden disappearance of the long cycle in a DPV, after the Galactic DPV TYC 5353-1137-1. The disappearance of the long cycle in AU Mon is a strong constraint for current models that aim to explain the long cycle in DPVs.</description>

      <title>Prospects of Constraining Equilibrium Tides in Low-Mass Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of short-period low-mass binary stars (with mass $M &lt; 1.5M_{\odot}$, from formation to the late main-sequence, and with orbital periods less than $\sim$10 days) is strongly influenced by tidal dissipation. This process drives orbital and rotational evolution that ultimately results in circularized orbits and rotational frequencies synchronized with the orbital frequency. Despite the fundamental role of tidal dissipation in binary evolution, constraining its magnitude of (typically parameterized by the tidal quality factor $\mathcal{Q}$) has remained discrepant by orders of magnitude in the existing literature. Recent observational constraints from time-series photometry (e.g., Kepler, K2, TESS), as well as advances in theoretical models to incorporate a more realistic gravitational response within stellar interiors, are invigorating new optimism for resolving this long-standing problem. To investigate the prospects and limitations of constraining tidal $\mathcal{Q}$, we use global sensitivity analysis and simulation based inference to examine how the initial conditions and tidal $\mathcal{Q}$ influence the observable orbital and rotational states. Our results show that even under the simplest and most tractable models of tides, the path towards inferring $\mathcal{Q}$ from individual systems is severely hampered by inherent degeneracies between tidal $\mathcal{Q}$ and the initial conditions, even when considering the strongest possible constraints (i.e., binaries with precise masses, ages, orbital periods, eccentricities, and rotation periods). Finally as an alternative, we discuss how population synthesis approaches may be a more promising path forward for validating tidal theories.</description>

      <title>Solar Spicules, Filigrees and Solar Wind Switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spicules, the smallest observable jet-like dynamic features ubiquitous in the chromosphere, are supposedly an important potential source for small-scale solar wind transients, with supporting evidence yet needed. We studied the high-resolution H-alpha images (0.10'') and magnetograms (0.29'') from Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) to find that spicules are an ideal candidate for the solar wind magnetic switchbacks detected by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). It is not that spicules are a miniature of coronal jets, but that they have unique properties not found in other solar candidates in explaining solar origin of switchbacks. (1) The spicules under this study originate from filigrees, all in a single magnetic polarity. Since filigrees are known as footpoints of open fields, the spicule guiding field lines can form a unipolar funnel, which is needed to create an SB patch, a group of fieldlines that switch from one common base polarity to the other polarity. (2) The spicules come in a cluster lined up along a supergranulation boundary, and the simulated waiting times from their spatial intervals exhibit a number distribution continuously decreasing from a few sec to ~30 min, similar to that of switchbacks. (3) From a time-distance map for spicules, we estimate their occurrence rate as 0.55 spicules per Mm^2 and second, sufficiently high for detection by PSP. In addition the dissimilarity of spicules with coronal jets, including the absence of base brightening and low correlation with EUV emission is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>An All-sky Survey of White Dwarf Merger Remnants: Far-UV is the Key</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of merging white dwarfs leave behind a white dwarf remnant. Hot/warm DQ white dwarfs with carbon-rich atmospheres have high masses and unusual kinematics. All evidence points to a merger origin. Here, we demonstrate that far-UV + optical photometry provides an efficient way to identify these merger remnants. We take advantage of this photometric selection to identify 167 candidates in the GALEX All-Sky Imaging Survey footprint, and provide follow-up spectroscopy. Out of the 140 with spectral classifications, we identify 75 warm DQ white dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}&gt;10,000$ K, nearly tripling the number of such objects known. Our sample includes 13 DAQ white dwarfs with spectra dominated by hydrogen and (weaker) carbon lines. Ten of these are new discoveries, including the hottest DAQ known to date with $T_{\rm eff}\approx23,000$ K and $M=1.31~M_{\odot}$. We provide a model atmosphere analysis of all warm DQ white dwarfs found, and present their temperature and mass distributions. The sample mean and standard deviation are $T_{\rm eff} = 14,560 \pm 1970$ K and $M=1.11 \pm 0.09~M_{\odot}$. Warm DQs are roughly twice as massive as the classical DQs found at cooler temperatures. All warm DQs are found on or near the crystallization sequence. Even though their estimated cooling ages are of order 1 Gyr, their kinematics indicate an origin in the thick disk or halo. Hence, they are likely stuck on the crystallization sequence for $\sim$10 Gyr due to significant cooling delays from distillation of neutron-rich impurities. Future all-sky far-UV surveys like UVEX have the potential to significantly expand this sample.</description>

      <title>Solar Alfvenic Pulses and Mesoscale Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale solar ejections are well understood, but the extent to which small-scale solar features directly influence the solar wind remains an open question, primarily due to the challenges of tracing these small-scale ejections and their impact. Here, we measure the fine-scale motions of network bright points along a coronal hole boundary in high-resolution H-alpha images from the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory to quantify the agitation of open flux tubes into generating Alfvenic pulses. We combine the motion, magnetic flux, and activity duration of the flux tubes to estimate the energy content carried by individual Alfvenic pulses, which is ~10+25 erg, adequately higher than the energies ~10+23 erg estimated for the magnetic switchbacks observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). This implies the possibility that the surface-generated Alfvenic pulses could reach the solar wind with sufficient energy to generate switchbacks, even though some of then are expected to be reflected back in the stratified solar atmosphere. Alfvenic pulses further reproduce for the first time other properties of switchbacks, including the filling factor above ~8% at granular and supergranular scales, which correspond best to the lower end of the mesoscale structure. This quantitative result for solar energy output in the form of Alfvenic pulses through magnetic funnels provides a crucial clue to the ongoing debate about the dynamic cycle of energy exchange between the Sun and the mesoscale solar wind that has been raised, but has not been adequately addressed, by PSP near-Sun observations.</description>

      <title>Solar Chromospheric Network as a Source for Solar Wind Switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the magnetic switchbacks (SBs) detected by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) carry information on the scales of solar supergranulation (large scale) and granulation (medium scale). We test this claim using high-resolution H-alpha images obtained with the visible spectro-polarimeters (VIS) of the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) in Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). As possible solar sources, we count all the spicule-like features standing along the chromospheric networks near the coronal hole boundary visible in the H-alpha blue-wing but absent in the red-wing images and measure the geometric parameters of dense sections of individual flux tubes. Intervals between adjacent spicules located along the chromospheric networks are found in the range of 0.4-1.5 Mm (0.03 deg - 0.12 deg) tending to be smaller than the medium scale of SBs. Inter-distances between all pairs of the flux tubes are also counted and they appear in a single peak distribution around 0.7 Mm (0.06 deg) unlike the waiting time distribution of SBs in a scale-free single power-law form. Length-to-diameter ratio of the dense section of flux tubes is as high as 6-40, similar to the aspect ratio of SBs. Number of spicules along a network can be as high as 40-100, consistent with numerous SBs within a patch. With these numbers, it is agued that the medium scale of SBs can be understood as an equilibrium distance resulting from random walk within each diverging magnetic field funnels connected to the chromospheric networks.</description>

      <title>Large-amplitude Oscillations of a Quiescent Filament Excited by an Extreme-ultravioletWave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength observations of simultaneous longitudinal and transverse oscillations of a quiescent filament excited by an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave on 2023 February 17. A hot channel eruption generates an X2.3 class flare and a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) in active region (AR) NOAA 13229 close to the eastern limb. The CME drives an EUV wave, which propagates westward at a speed of ~459 km s-1. After arriving at the filament ~340.3 Mm away from the flare site, the filament is disturbed and starts large-amplitude oscillations, which are mainly observed in 171 {\AA}.The longitudinal oscillations last for nearly two cycles. The average initial amplitude, velocity, period, and damping time are ~4.7 Mm, ~26.5 km s-1, ~1099.1 s, and ~2760.3 s, respectively. According to the pendulum model, the curvature radius and minimum horizontal magnetic field strength of the dips are estimated to be 6.7-9.9 Mm and 4.6-5.6 G. The transverse oscillations last for 2-3 cycles. The average initial amplitude, velocity, period, and damping time are ~1.8 Mm, ~11.2 km s-1, ~994.4 s, and ~3576.2 s, respectively. The radial magnetic field strength of the dips are estimated to be 6.6-7.4 G.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of HD 49798, a bright, hydrogen-deficient sdO-type donor star in an accreting X-ray binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: HD 49798 is a bright ($m_{\rm V} = 8.287$), hot (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 45000$ K) subdwarf star of the spectral type O (sdO). It is the only confirmed sdO-type mass-donor star of an X-ray binary that has a high-mass (1.28 $M_\odot$) white-dwarf or neutron-star primary with a spin period of only 13.2 s. Aims: Since a high-quality spectrum of HD 49798, obtained with the T\"ubingen Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrometer (TUES), that has never been analyzed before is available in the database of the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS), we performed a spectral analysis based on observations from the far ultraviolet (FUV) to the optical wavelength range. Methods: We used advanced non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmospheres of the Tuebingen Model-Atmosphere Package (TMAP) to determine the effective temperature, the surface gravity ($\log g$), and the abundances of those elements that exhibit lines in the available observed spectra. Results: We determined $T_{\rm eff} = 45000 \pm 1000$ K, log (g / cm/s$^2$) = $4.46 \pm 0.10$, and re-analyzed the previously determined photospheric abundances of H, He, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, and Ni. For the first time, we measured the abundances of C, Ne, P, S, Cr, and Mn. Conclusons: Our panchromatic spectral analysis of HD 49798 -- from the FUV to the optical -- allowed to reduce the error limits of the photospheric parameters and to precisely measure the metal abundances. HD 49798 is a stripped, intermediate-mass (zero-age main sequence mass of about 7.15 $M_\odot$) He star with a mass of 1.14(+0.30/-0.24) $M_\odot$. At its surface it exhibits abundances that are the result of CNO-cycle and 3 alpha burning nucleosynthesis as well as enhanced Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni abundances.</description>

      <title>An Atlas of Spectroheliograms from 3641 to 6600 \AA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral atlas of solar spectroheliograms covering the wavelength range from 3641 to 6600 \AA, with continuous coverage between 3711 and 5300 \AA, and sparser coverage beyond this range. The spectral resolution varies between R $\sim$ 20 000 and 40 000, with a spectral step size between 60 and 90 m\AA, while the spatial resolution averages around 2.5 arcseconds. These observations were acquired over three months during the 2025 solar maximum, using amateur spectroheliographs (Sol'Ex and ML Astro SHG 700). The atlas is accessible via an interactive online platform with navigation tools and direct access to individual spectroheliograms.</description>

      <title>A kinematic and structural study of young open clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy using Gaia DR3 catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1 kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc, covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters, stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.</description>

Abstract: We report medium-resolution $0.85-2.45\,\mu$m spectroscopy obtained in 2015 and 2022 and high resolution $2.27-2.39\,\mu$m and $4.59-4.77\,\mu$m spectroscopy obtained in 2015 of V838 Monocerotis, along with modeling of the $0.85-2.45\,\mu$ spectrum. V838 Mon underwent a series of eruptions and extreme brightenings in 2002, which are thought to have occured as a result of a stellar merger. The new spectra and modelling of them reveal a disturbed red giant photosphere that is probably continuing to contract and ejecta that are cooling and continuing to disperse at velocities up to 200kms$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an Inverse Cascade of Magnetic Helicity in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To elucidate the cascade direction of the solar wind turbulence, we analyzed magnetic helicity density spectra from the Parker Solar Probe data across more than 500 heliocentric distances. For the first time, we confirmed a persistent inverse cascade extending from the Sun to Mercury's orbital vicinity. This finding challenges the conventional hypothesis that the magnetic helicity density within the inner heliosphere is random. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a radial sign change of the spectral magnetic helicity density at a frequency whose value decreases logarithmically with distance. These results provide new insights into the evolution of solar wind turbulence in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Magnetic Fields on Second-Generation Star Formation in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored role of magnetic fields in the formation of second-generation (SG) stars in proto-globular clusters (GCs) using 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamical simulations. This study is based on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario and incorporates photoionization feedback and stellar winds from AGB stars. We model SG formation within a young ($34$ Myr) massive ($10^6 $ Msun) proto-GC moving through a magnetized, homogeneous interstellar medium. Our results indicate that variations in magnetic field strength and orientation significantly influence the gas geometry and SG star-forming regions around the cluster. Overall, magnetic fields limit SG formation to the very center of the cluster, with stronger magnetic fields tending to form more compact SG clusters. For magnetic field strengths of $0.5$ and $5$ microG, we observe no substantial changes in the mass of formed SG stars. However, with a strong $50$ microG field, we see a $25$ percent increase or a $70$ percent decrease in total SG mass, for a field aligned parallel or perpendicular to the cluster's motion, respectively. This variation reflects how magnetic fields influence gas accretion, as our results suggest that gas accreted from the interstellar medium (ISM) slightly dominates over AGB ejecta in the cluster, except in cases of strong perpendicular fields, where gas accretion is efficiently suppressed. Additionally, stronger magnetic fields limit the cluster's ability to retain its ejecta, leading to the formation of stars with lower helium abundances. On the other hand, a strong perpendicular magnetic field produces SG stars that originate from AGB ejecta and exhibit the highest helium abundances.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Stars Match the Spectral Signatures of JWST's Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M_\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the extreme, V-shaped Balmer break is an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.</description>

      <title>Hadronic acceleration in the young star cluster NGC 6611 inside the M16 region unveiled by Fermi-LAT: constraints on the acceleration efficiency</title>

Abstract: Context. Young Massive Star Clusters, long considered as potentially important sources of galactic cosmic rays, have recently emerged as gamma-ray emitters up to very high energies. Aims. In order to quantify the contribution of this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the typical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for emission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We perform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a star-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind termination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive the energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We find significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated to the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic emission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination shock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the cloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration efficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\sim$ 1 % and $\sim$ 4 %.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant candidate \snr\ associated with the Calvera pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT \sim 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and o abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kya old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinti "Clump" region shows hared emission equally well described by a thermal (kT\sim 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma \sim 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Alpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded</description>

      <title>Tidal Synchronization of TESS Eclipsing Binaries</title>

Abstract: Tidal synchronization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of binary star systems. However, key details such as the timescale of synchronization, efficiency of tidal dissipation, rotational period, and dependence on stellar mass are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods, orbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing binaries (EBs) that can be used to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf (FGKM spectral type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB orbital and rotational periods (Porb and Prot) measured from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the TESS Eclipsing Binary Catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability type: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability, non-periodic variability, and "other" variability (e.g. pulsations). We then manually validate each light curve classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584 high-confidence EBs that exhibit detectable star-spot modulation. From there, we measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using three methods: Lomb-Scargle periodograms, autocorrelation function, and phase dispersion minimization. We find that our period distributions are consistent with previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to identify two populations: a synchronous population (with Porb~Prot) and a subsynchronous population (with 8Porb~7Prot). Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a unimodal distribution for Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or combined, confirming that the subsynchronous population is statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Interplay between tidal flows and magnetic fields in nonlinear simulations of stellar and planetary convective envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars and planets in close systems are magnetised but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses (and vice versa) and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in convective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to tidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal circularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital migration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as incompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially (rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its strength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be substantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong tidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large tidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial magnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can inhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell stresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and characterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfv\'en waves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is close to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of Pm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars, such that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational instability in a solar mean-field dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question whether the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field, but in our Cartesian cases it is found to reduce the resulting magnetic field strength and thus to suppress the dynamo process. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</description>

Abstract: Energetic particles in interplanetary space are normally measured at time scales that are long compared to the ion gyroperiod. Such observations by necessity average out the microphysics associated with the acceleration and transport of 10s - 100s keV particles. We investigate previously unseen non-equilibrium features that only become observable at very high time resolution, and discuss possible explanations of these features. We use unprecedentedly high-time-resolution data that were acquired by the in situ instruments on Solar Orbiter in the vicinity of two interplanetary shocks observed on 2023-11-29 07:51:17 UTC and 2023-11-30 10:47:26 UTC at $\sim 0.83$ astronomical units from the Sun. The solar-wind proton beam population follows the magnetic field instantaneously, on time scales which are significantly shorter than a gyro-period. Energetic particles, despite sampling large volumes of space, vary on remarkably short time scales, typically on the order of the convection time of their gyro-radius. Non-equilibrium features such as bump-on-tail distributions of energetic particles are formed by small-scale magnetic structures in the IMF. High-time-resolution observations show previously unobserved microphysics in the vicinity of two traveling interplanetary shocks, including ion reflection at a current sheet, which may explain where ions are reflected in shock acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations reveal small-scale reconnection-driven plasma ejections, often termed nanojets, triggered by magnetic field interactions at slight misalignment angles. These fast, collimated plasma ejections are $\sim$1.5 Mm long and $\sim$0.5 Mm wide. In this study, we analyze two high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, corresponding to an eruptive (M7.6) and a confined (C1.2) flare, to investigate the dynamics of nanoflare ejections and, for the first time, compare their properties in distinct magnetic environments. We identified 59 nanoflare ejections: 44 in the eruptive flare and 15 in the confined flare event. Our analysis reveals that these events form two distinct classes: confined events exhibit lower speeds (41--174 kms$^{-1}$) and lower kinetic energies ($10^{20}$--$10^{22}$ erg), placing them closely in or near the picoflare energy regime, while eruptive events show higher speeds (131--775 kms$^{-1}$) and higher kinetic energies ($10^{22}$--$10^{24}$ erg), falling within the nanoflare regime. Furthermore, magnetic field extrapolations reveal a highly sheared arcade with greater twist and higher magnetic energy density in the eruptive event, compared to the less twisted configuration in the confined event. We infer that this sheared arcade configuration in the eruptive event creates favorable conditions for higher speeds and kinetic energies, unlike the less braided structure in the confined event. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the surrounding magnetic environment in regulating the energetics of nanoflare ejections in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. I. A suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of high-mass star-forming clumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars.
  Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA.
  Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included.
  Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,</description>

Abstract: The position of the innermost planet (i.e., the inner edge) in a planetary system provides important information about the relationship of the entire system to its host star properties, offering potentially valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution processes. In this work, based on the Kepler Data Release 25 (DR25) catalog combined with LAMOST and Gaia data, we investigate the correlation between stellar mass and the inner edge position across different populations of small planets in multi-planetary systems, such as super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. By correcting for the influence of stellar metallicity and analyzing the impact of observational selection effects, we confirm the trend that as stellar mass increases, the position of the inner edge shifts outward. Our results reveal a stronger correlation between the inner edge and stellar mass with a power-law index of 0.6-1.1, which is larger compared to previous studies. The stronger correlation in our findings is primarily attributed to two factors: first, the metallicity correction applied in this work enhances the correlation; second, the previous use of occurrence rates to trace the inner edge weakens the observed correlation. Through comparison between observed statistical results and current theoretical models, we find that the pre-main-sequence (PMS) dust sublimation radius of the protoplanetary disk best matches the observed inner edge stellar mass. Therefore, we conclude that the inner dust disk likely limits the innermost orbits of small planets, contrasting with the inner edges of hot Jupiters, which are associated with the magnetospheres of gas disks, as suggested by previous studies. This highlights that the inner edges of different planetary populations are likely regulated by distinct mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We present the SpecDis value added stellar distance catalog accompanying DESI DR1. SpecDis trains a feed-forward Neural Network (NN) with Gaia parallaxes and gets the distance estimates. To build up unbiased training sample, we do not apply selections on parallax error or signal-to-noise (S/N) of the stellar spectra, and instead we incorporate parallax error into the loss function. Moreover, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the noise and dimensionality of stellar spectra. Validated by independent external samples of member stars with precise distances from globular clusters (GCs), dwarf galaxies, stellar streams, combined with blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars, we demonstrate that our distance measurements show no significant bias up to 100kpc, and are much more precise than Gaia parallax beyond 7kpc. The median distance uncertainties are 23%, 19%, 11% and 7% for S/N $&lt;$ 20, 20 $\leq$ S/N$&lt;$ 60, 60 $\leq$ S/N $&lt;$ 100 and S/N $\geq$ 100. Selecting stars with $\log g&lt;3.8$ and distance uncertainties smaller than 25%, we have more than 74,000 giant candidates within 50kpc to the Galactic center and 1,500 candidates beyond this distance. Additionally, we develop a Gaussian mixture model to identify unresolvable equal-mass binaries by modeling the discrepancy between the NN-predicted and the geometric absolute magnitudes from Gaia parallaxes and identify 120,000 equal-mass binary candidates. Our final catalog provides distances and distance uncertainties for $&gt;$ 4 million stars, offering a valuable resource for Galactic astronomy.</description>
