      <title>Insights into the role of dynamical features in protein complex formation: the case of SARS-CoV-2 spike binding with ACE2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functionality of protein-protein complexes is closely tied to the strength of their interactions, making the evaluation of binding affinity a central focus in structural biology. However, the molecular determinants underlying binding affinity are still not fully understood. In particular, the entropic contributions, especially those arising from conformational dynamics, remain poorly characterized. In this study, we explore the relationship between protein motion and binding stability and its role in protein function. To gain deeper insight into how protein complexes modulate their stability, we investigated a model system with a well-characterized and fast evolutionary history: a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants bound to the human ACE2 receptor, for which experimental binding affinity data are available. Through Molecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical differences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike protein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more stable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in their unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed after binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole driving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized by a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but could optimize other traits, such as antibody escape. These results suggest that to fully understand the strength of the binding between two proteins, the stability of the two isolated partners should be investigated.</description>

      <title>A cautious user's guide in applying HMMs to physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature, as far as we know, evolves continuously through space and time. Yet the ubiquitous hidden Markov model (HMM)--originally developed for discrete time and space analysis in natural language processing--remains a central tool in interpreting time series data drawn from from physical systems. This raises a fundamental question: What are the implications of applying a discrete-state, discrete-time framework to analyze data generated by a continuously evolving system? Through synthetic data generated using Langevin dynamics in an effective potential, we explore under what circumstances HMMs yield interpretable results. Our analysis reveals that the discrete-state approximation acts primarily as an abstraction with the inferred states visited in time often more closely reflecting the measurement protocol and modeling choices than features of the underlying physical potential. Crucially, we demonstrate that the states visited over the course of a time series recovered by the HMM can be tuned a priori by adjusting the data acquisition scheme even misleadingly recovering reproducible "intermediate" states using different HMM tools for a system evolving in a single well potential. We conclude with a note of measured caution: while HMMs offer a mathematically elegant framework for time series inference, their use in physical modeling should be guided by an awareness of their limitations. In this light, we outline important generalizations of the HMM to continuous space and time and highlight the importance of a well calibrated measurement noise model.</description>

      <title>Into the Unknown: From Structure to Disorder in Protein Function Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) account for one-third of the human proteome and play essential biological roles. However, predicting the functions of IDRs remains a major challenge due to their lack of stable structures, rapid sequence evolution, and context-dependent behavior. Many predictors of protein function neglect or underperform on IDRs. Recent advances in computational biology and machine learning, including protein language models, alignment-free approaches, and IDR-specific methods, have revealed conserved bulk features and local motifs within IDRs that are linked to function. This review highlights emerging computational methods that map the sequence-function relationship in IDRs, outlines critical challenges in IDR function annotation, and proposes a community-driven framework to accelerate interpretable functional predictions for IDRs.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot protein stability prediction by inverse folding models: a free energy interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.</description>

      <title>AANet: Virtual Screening under Structural Uncertainty via Alignment and Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets. Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and (2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.</description>

      <title>pLDDT-Predictor: High-speed Protein Screening Using Transformer and ESM2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in protein structure prediction, particularly AlphaFold2, have revolutionized structural biology by achieving near-experimental accuracy ($\text{average RMSD} &lt; 1.5\text{\AA}$). However, the computational demands of these models (approximately 30 minutes per protein on an RTX 4090) significantly limit their application in high-throughput protein screening. While large language models like ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) have shown promise in extracting structural information directly from protein sequences, rapid assessment of protein structure quality for large-scale analyses remains a major challenge.
  We introduce pLDDT-Predictor, a high-speed protein screening tool that achieves a $250,000\times$ speedup compared to AlphaFold2 by leveraging pre-trained ESM2 protein embeddings and a Transformer architecture. Our model predicts AlphaFold2's pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) scores with a Pearson correlation of 0.7891 and processes proteins in just 0.007 seconds on average. Using a comprehensive dataset of 1.5 million diverse protein sequences (ranging from 50 to 2048 amino acids), we demonstrate that pLDDT-Predictor accurately classifies high-confidence structures (pLDDT $&gt;$ 70) with 91.2\% accuracy and achieves an MSE of 84.8142 compared to AlphaFold2's predictions.
  The source code and pre-trained models are freely available at https://github.com/jw-chae/pLDDT_Predictor, enabling the research community to perform rapid, large-scale protein structure quality assessments.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Enzyme Function Prediction via Residue-Level Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting multiple functions labeled with Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers from the enzyme sequence is of great significance but remains a challenge due to its sparse multi-label classification nature, i.e., each enzyme is typically associated with only a few labels out of more than 6000 possible EC numbers. However, existing machine learning algorithms generally learn a fixed global representation for each enzyme to classify all functions, thereby they lack interpretability and the fine-grained information of some function-specific local residue fragments may be overwhelmed. Here we present an attention-based framework, namely ProtDETR (Protein Detection Transformer), by casting enzyme function prediction as a detection problem. It uses a set of learnable functional queries to adaptatively extract different local representations from the sequence of residue-level features for predicting different EC numbers. ProtDETR not only significantly outperforms existing deep learning-based enzyme function prediction methods, but also provides a new interpretable perspective on automatically detecting different local regions for identifying different functions through cross-attentions between queries and residue-level features. Code is available at https://github.com/yangzhao1230/ProtDETR.</description>
