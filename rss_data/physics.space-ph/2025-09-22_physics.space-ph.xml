      <title>Particle in cell simulation on mode conversion of Saturn's 20 kHz narrowband radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Z-to-O mode conversion at the density gradient is the prevailing mechanism of narrowband (NB) radio emission in planetary magnetosphere. Most previous numerical models were for NB emission observed in the Earth magnetosphere, using the cold plasma fluid approximation that excluded any kinetic effect. Here we investigate the Z-to-O conversion process underlying the Saturn's 20 kHz NB emission, using the fully-kinetic and electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. We simulate the whole process starting from the pumping of the Z mode, to its propagation and reflection, and further conversion into the O mode radiation. The energy conversion rate of the Z-to-O process is estimated to be 10-20%. This provides the first quantitative estimate of such rate with PIC simulations.</description>

      <title>Ground-Based Radar Tracking of Near-Earth Objects With VLBI Radio Telescopes: 2024 MK Test Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Southern Hemisphere Asteroid Research Project is an active and informal entity comprising the University of New South Wales, the University of Tasmania, the University of Western Australia, and the Curtin University, which performs asteroid research in collaboration with federal agencies, including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (JPL). Since 2015, we have used the Australian infrastructure to characterize more than 50 near-Earth asteroids through bistatic radar observations. On 29 June 2024, we used four very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) radio telescopes to follow the close approach of 2024 MK to the Earth. In this paper, we describe the detections and the analysis of VLBI and howthese observations can help to improve the understanding of its composition and orbit characterization.</description>

      <title>Flare energetics, CME launch and heliospheric propagation for the May 2024 events, as derived from ensemble MHD modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many questions must be answered before understanding the relationship between the emerging magnetic flux through the solar surface and the extreme geoeffective events. The main ingredients for getting X-ray class flares and large interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the build-up of electric current in the corona, the existence of magnetic free energy, magnetic energy/helicity ratio, twist, and magnetic stress in active regions (ARs). The upper limit of solar energy in the space research era, as well as the potential for experiencing superflares and extreme solar events, can be predicted using MHD simulations of CMEs.
  To address this problem, we consider the recent events of May 2024 and use three MHD models: 1) OHM ("Observationally driven High order scheme Magnetohydrodynamic code") for investigating the magnetic evolutions at a synthetic dipole structure. 2) TMF (time-dependent magneto-friction) for setting up an initial non-potential magnetic field in the active region. A zero-beta MHD model for tracing the magnetic evolution of active regions. 3) EUHFORIA (''European heliospheric forecasting information asset'') for interplanetary CME propagations.
  For the eruptive flares with CMEs, magnetic solar energy is computed along with data-constrained MHD simulations for the May 2024 events. We show the consistency between the data-initiated realistic simulation of the May 2024 big event and energy scalings from an idealised simulation of a bipolar eruption using OHM. The estimated free magnetic energy did not surpass $5.2 \times 10^{32}\;$erg. Good arrival time predictions ($&lt;3$ hours) are achieved with the EUHFORIA simulation with the cone model. We note the interest in coupling all the chains of codes from the Sun to the Earth and developing different approaches to test the results.</description>

      <title>Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>
