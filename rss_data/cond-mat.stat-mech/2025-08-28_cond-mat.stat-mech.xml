      <description>arXiv:2508.20184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, after suitably adjusting a uniform transverse magnetic field, the generic inhomogeneous open XX spin chain has a two-fold degeneracy, and an exact $su(2)$ symmetry whose "inhomogeneous" generators depend on coefficients that can be explicitly computed for models associated with discrete orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Machine learning topological defect formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the density of topological defects created during a second-order phase transition is determined by the correlation length at the freeze-out time. This suggests that the final configuration of topological defects in such a transition is largely established during the impulse regime, soon after the critical point is traversed. Motivated by this, we conjecture that machine learning (ML) can predict the final configuration of topological defects based on the time evolution of the order parameter over a short interval in the vicinity of the critical point, well before the order parameter settles into the emerging new minima resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we show that the predictability of ML also follows the power law scaling dictated by KZM. We demonstrate these using a Recurrent Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle with diffusion: boundary local times and the zero-diffusion limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating boundary conditions into stochastic models of passive or active particle motion is usually implemented at the level of the associated forward or backward Kolmogorov equation, whose solution determines the probability distribution of sample paths. In order to write down the corresponding stochastic differential equation (SDE) that generates the individual sample paths, it is necessary to introduce a Brownian functional that keeps track of the boundary-particle contact time. We previously constructed the SDE for a (non-diffusing) run-and-tumble particle (RTP) on the half-line with either a reflecting or sticky wall at $x=0$. In this paper we extend the theory to include the effects of diffusion. One of the non-trivial consequences of combining drift-diffusion with tumbling is that the zero diffusion limit $D\rightarrow 0$ is singular in the sense that the number of boundary conditions is doubled when $D&gt;0$. We use stochastic calculus to derive the forward Kolmogorov equation for two distinct boundary conditions that reduce, respectively, to non-sticky and sticky boundary conditions in the zero-diffusion limit. In the latter case, it is necessary to include a boundary layer in a neighbourhood of the wall and use singular perturbation theory. We also treat the wall as partially absorbing by assuming that the particle is absorbed when the amount of boundary-particle contact time (discrete or continuous local time) exceeds a quenched random threshold. Finally, we analyse the survival probability and corresponding FPT density for absorption at a non-sticky wall by deriving the corresponding backward Kolmogorov equation</description>

      <title>Evanescent random walker on networks: Hitting times, budget renewal, and survival dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.</description>

      <title>Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and run-and-tumble motion of a chemotactic particle in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic dynamics of a symmetric self-chemotactic particle and determine the long-time behavior of its mean squared displacement (MSD). The attractive or repulsive interaction of the particle with the chemical field that it generates induces a non-linear, non-Markovian effective dynamics, which results into anomalous diffusion for spatial dimensions $d \leq 2$. In one spatial dimension, we map the case of repulsive chemotaxis onto a run-and-tumble-like dynamics, leading to an MSD which, as a function of the elapsed time $t$, grows superdiffusively with exponent $4/3$. In the presence of attractive chemotaxis, instead, the particle exhibits a slowdown, with the MSD growing logarithmically with time. In $d=2$, we find logarithmic aging of the diffusion coefficient, while in $d=3$ the motion reverts standard diffusive behavior with a renormalized diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of the three-state Potts quantum spin chain in the extreme ferromagnetic regime using perturbation theory in the transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that this approach provides access to features well beyond the semiclassical method applied previously, including the description of resonant excitations and analytic prediction for the time evolution after a quantum quench. We also demonstrate that it agrees with the meson/bubble spectrum results from exact diagonalisation and the numerical simulations of the time evolution.</description>

      <title>Multicritical Infection Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact process is a simple infection spreading model showcasing an out-of-equilibrium phase transition between a macroscopically active and an inactive phase. Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role, a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical simulations.</description>

      <title>Activity propagation with Hebbian learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Towards Large-Spin Effective Theory II: $O(2)$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to construct a holographic effective theory for the leading-twist operators in the $O(2)$ model in the $4-d=\epsilon$ expansion up to $O(\epsilon^2)$, based on the separation of short-distance and long-distance effects that arises as a function of spin $J$. We obtain the Hamiltonian of the theory and show that it correctly reproduces all the dimensions at $O(\epsilon^2)$ of the leading twist operators for all values of the charge $Q$ and spin $J$. The holographic Hamiltonian is given by the bulk exchange of a charged scalar $\phi$, neutral scalar $s \sim \phi \phi^*$, and a `ghost' field $c$, as well as a single local bulk interaction $(\phi \phi^*)^2$. We analyze various aspects of the spectrum and discuss their interpretation in light of the bulk description.</description>

      <title>Symmetry enforces entanglement at high temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo "sudden death of entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states (canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs states do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent fermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and quantum information in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Kramers-Wannier dualities in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged) fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW (self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Collective communication in a transparent world: Phase transitions in a many-body Potts model and social-quantum duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schelling-like social competition reflected in "dynamics of opinions" among groups of agents ("communities") in a highly transparent world. Specifically, we investigate a $q$-state Potts spin system with competing two- and three-body interactions on a complete graph. Agents interact through pairwise repulsion (opposing opinions) between different communities and three-body attraction (shared opinions) within the same community. In the thermodynamic limit, we identify variants of three key phases: (a) a symmetric "mixed" phase of $q$ states, in which no single opinion dominates in the society (interpreted as a "democracy"), (b) a symmetric "mixed" phase but of $q-1$ states, and (c) a "consensus" phase, characterized by the emergence of a dominant opinion (or "ideology"), coexisting with symmetrically distributed minority views. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal finite-size effects and metastable switching between configurations. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between our social model on a complete graph and the mean-field $SU(N)$ quantum spin system with both quadratic and cubic interactions, revealing a "social-quantum" duality. This duality provides new perspectives on both stratification of social communication, and quantum many-body phenomena, offering a unified framework for understanding emergent collective behavior in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $B\"uttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Density Matrix: Formalism and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the general formalism and properties of the spacetime density matrix, which captures correlations among different Cauchy surfaces and can be regarded as a natural generalization of the standard density matrix defined on a single Cauchy surface. We present the construction of the spacetime density matrix in general quantum systems and its representation via the Schwinger Keldysh path integral. We further introduce a super-operator framework, within which the spacetime density matrix appears as a special case, and discuss possible generalizations from this perspective. We also show that the spacetime density matrix satisfies a Liouville von Neumann type equation of motion. When considering subsystems, a reduced spacetime density matrix can be defined by tracing over complementary degrees of freedom. We study the general properties of its moments and, in particular, derive universal short time behavior of the second moment. We find that coupling between subsystems plays a crucial role in obtaining nontrivial results. Assuming weak coupling, we develop a perturbative method to compute the moments systematically.</description>

      <title>Photonic restricted Boltzmann machine for content generation tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling, enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations. The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative artificial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>The total energy approach for calculating the specific heat of liquids and glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of the calculation of specific heat ($C$) of liquids and glasses by first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is reviewed. Liquid and glass states have common properties in that there is no periodicity and the atom relaxation has an important role in their thermodynamic properties. These properties have, for a long time, hindered the construction of an appropriate theory of $C$ for these states. The total energy approach based on the density-functional theory (DFT) provides a universal method to calculate $C$, irrespective of the material states. However, aside from the convergence problem, even DFT-based MD simulations give different values for a thermodynamic property of liquids and glasses, depending on the setup of MD simulations. The essential problem is atom relaxation, which affects the relationship between the energy and temperature $T$. The temperature is determined by the equilibrium state, but there are many metastable states for glasses. Metastable states are stable within their relaxation times. We encounter the difficult problem of hysteresis, which is the most profound consequence of irreversibility. Irreversibility occurs even for quasistatic processes. This is the most difficult and confusing point in the thermodynamics literature. Here, a consistent treatment of both equilibrium properties and irreversibility in adiabatic MD simulations, which has no frictional term, is given by taking multi-timescales into account. A leading principle to determine the equilibrium is provided by the second law of thermodynamics. The basic ideas and the usefulness of the total energy approach in real calculations are presented.</description>

      <title>Stability of many-body localization in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered quantum many-body systems pose one of the central challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information science, as their dynamics are generally intractable for classical computation. Many-body localization (MBL), hypothesized to evade thermalization indefinitely under strong disorder, exemplifies this difficulty. Here, we study the stability of MBL in two dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices with variable system sizes up to $24\times 24$ sites, well beyond the classically simulable regime. Using the imbalance as a probe, we trace the long-time dynamics under two distinctive disorder potentials: quasiperiodic and random disorder. For random disorder, the MBL crossover point shifts to higher disorder strength with increasing system size, consistent with the avalanche scenario. In contrast, with quasiperiodic disorder, we observe no clear system size dependence, suggesting possible stability of MBL in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Boundary bootstrap for the three-dimensional O($N$) normal universality class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-dimensional classical O($N$) model with a boundary has received renewed interest due to the discovery of the extraordinary-log boundary university class for $2\leq N&lt; N_\text{c}$. The exponent of the spin correlator and the critical value $N_c$ are related to certain universal amplitudes in the normal universality class. To determine their precise values, we revisit the 3d O($N$) boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) for $N=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. After substantially improving the accuracy of the boundary bootstrap, our determinations are in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo results, resolving the previous discrepancies due to low truncation orders. We also use the recent bulk bootstrap results to derive highly accurate Ising data. Many bulk and boundary predictions are obtained for the first time. Our results demonstrate the great potential of the $\eta$ minimization method for many unexplored non-positive bootstrap problems.</description>

      <title>Distinct weak asymmetric interactions shape human brain functions as probability fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data. Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and collective signatures of feature learning in neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature extraction - the ability to identify relevant properties of data - is a key factor underlying the success of deep learning. Yet, it has proved difficult to elucidate its nature within existing predictive theories, to the extent that there is no consensus on the very definition of feature learning. A promising hint in this direction comes from previous phenomenological observations of quasi-universal aspects in the training dynamics of neural networks, displayed by simple properties of feature geometry. We address this problem within a statistical-mechanics framework for Bayesian learning in one hidden layer neural networks with standard parameterization. Analytical computations in the proportional limit (when both the network width and the size of the training set are large) can quantify fingerprints of feature learning, both collective ones (related to manifold geometry) and microscopic ones (related to the weights). In particular, (i) the distance between different class manifolds in feature space is a nonmonotonic function of the temperature, which we interpret as the equilibrium counterpart of a phenomenon observed under gradient descent (GD) dynamics, and (ii) the microscopic learnable parameters in the network undergo a finite data-dependent displacement with respect to the infinite-width limit, and develop correlations. These results indicate that nontrivial feature learning is at play in a regime where the posterior predictive distribution is that of Gaussian process regression with a trivially rescaled prior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.</description>

They present the basic definitions and mathematical results that form the theory of large deviations, as well as many simple motivating examples of applications in statistical physics, which serve as a basis for the many other lectures given at the school that covered more specific applications in biophysics, random matrix theory, nonequilibrium systems, geophysics, and the simulation of rare events, among other topics.

      <description>arXiv:2504.00815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach within the functional renormalization group framework for computing critical exponents that characterize the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium many-body systems. Our approach permits access to quantities involved in the renormalization procedure, using an expansion about time-translation invariant problems. This expansion can be upgraded to a fully time-dependent computation by iteration. As a prototypical example, we compute the aging exponent $\theta$ describing the dynamics of model A following a sudden quench to the critical point. Already at leading order, the approach demonstrates remarkable accuracy when compared with MC simulations and resummed perturbative expansions in the range $2&lt;d&lt;4$. This yields results that surpass those of the two-loop $\epsilon$ expansion in accuracy and match analytically known benchmarks at large $N$. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of out-of-equilibrium universality and open new avenues for non-perturbative studies of critical dynamics, as well as for exploring the critical behavior of systems with spatial boundaries.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>

Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Cavity Control of Topological Qubits: Fusion Rule, Anyon Braiding, and Majorana-Schr\"odinger Cat States</title>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of coupling a local electromagnetic cavity to a segment of a topological Kitaev chain (KC), with particular emphasis on the interplay between photons and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). In addition to the well-known {\it scissor effect}-which effectively partitions the chain and isolates free MZMs in the bulk-we provide evidence of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding operations, hallmark signatures of non-Abelian anyons, enabled by spatially selective ultrastrong KC-cavity coupling. We propose that these distinctive MZM properties can be experimentally probed via fermionic parity measurements and photon-induced Berry phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the so-called sweet-spot regime, the coupled system can be mapped onto a Rabi-like model with a homodyne-rotated quadrature, offering a simplified yet powerful theoretical description. Exploiting the symmetry of fermionic modes within a two-site cavity configuration, we also show the feasibility of generating hybrid MZM-polariton Schr\"odinger cat states. Our findings offer a novel approach to manipulating topological quantum matter through local light-matter interactions and provide theoretical tools for future experimental realizations in platforms such as quantum materials or superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed renormalisation group flows</title>

Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamic principles governing energy and information are important tools for a deeper understanding and better control of quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally investigate the interplay of the thermodynamic costs and information flow in a quantum system undergoing iterative quantum measurement and feedback. Our study employs a state stabilization protocol involving repeated measurement and feedback on an electronic spin qubit associated with a Silicon-Vacancy center in diamond, which is strongly coupled to a diamond nanocavity. This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback's causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol. Our work lays the foundation for investigating the entropic and energetic costs of real-time quantum control in various quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the existence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly velocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called $\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in non-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions between Accuracy Regimes in L2 regularized Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing the L2 regularization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) causes a first-order phase transition into the under-parametrized phase -- the so-called onset-of learning. We explain this transition via the scalar (Ricci) curvature of the error landscape. We predict new transition points as the data complexity is increased and, in accordance with the theory of phase transitions, the existence of hysteresis effects. We confirm both predictions numerically. Our results provide a natural explanation of the recently discovered phenomenon of '\emph{grokking}' as DNN models getting stuck in a local minimum of the error surface, corresponding to a lower accuracy phase. Our work paves the way for new probing methods of the intrinsic structure of DNNs in and beyond the L2 context.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>

Abstract: The concept of unitary randomness underpins the modern theory of quantum chaos and fundamental tasks in quantum information. In one research direction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct setting, approximate unitary designs look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble, an efficient unitary design. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We further compute the frame potential of the RMPU ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value also with only polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce freeness for traceless observables, volume-law operator entanglement is required. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>
