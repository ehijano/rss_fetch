      <title>Impeded Bloch Oscillation and Nonreciprocal Landau-Zener Tunneling of Bose-Einstein Quantum Droplets in Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear Bloch dynamics and Landau-Zener tunneling of quantum droplets in optical lattices, where the interplay between mean-field repulsion and beyond-mean-field attraction from Lee-Huang-Yang corrections introduces a localization impedance that inhibits dynamical dispersion. This self-stabilizing mechanism is crucial to droplet mobility and nonlinear dephasing under external driving. In the deep-lattice regime, simulation in tight-binding reduction reveals breathing modes, self-trapping, and nonlinear Bloch oscillations. In the shallow-lattice regime, we reformulate the problem in momentum space and map the dynamics onto a nonlinear two-level model with time-dependent detuning. The adiabatic spectrum features looped bands and multiple fixed points, parallelly captured by the phase-space structure through a classical Josephson analogy. Applying Hamilton-Jacobi theory, we quantify the tunneling probabilities and demonstrate nonreciprocal Landau-Zener tunneling. The transition probability from the lower to upper band differs from that of the reverse process, even under the same sweeping protocol. This asymmetry arises from nonlinearly induced band gap modulation, highlighting rich dynamical behavior beyond the linear and adiabatic regimes.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dynamics in Spherically-Curved Analog-Gravity Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low energy phonon dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with a density profile that is equivalent, via a coordinate transformation, to phonons traveling in a \lq\lq spherical\rq\rq\ curved spacetime that realizes the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. The metric of this BEC is characterized by its curvature $\kappa$ and a time-depdendent scale factor $a(t)$, with an increase in the latter corresponding to an expansion of the analog FLRW universe. We study the propagation of classical phonons in such BECs, finding that a sudden change in the scale factor induces ripples in the wave motion. In addition, we study quantum phonon creation (or vacuum amplification) due to the scale-factor modification and quantify their entanglement.</description>

      <title>Topological band insulators without translational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the research of the topological band phases, the conventional wisdom is to start from the crystalline translational symmetry systems. Nevertheless, the translational symmetry is not always a necessary condition for the energy bands. Here we propose a systematic method of constructing the topological band insulators without translational symmetry in the amorphous systems. By way of the isospectral reduction approach from spectral graph theory, we reduce the structural-disordered systems formed by different multi-atomic cells into the isospectral effective periodic systems with the energy-dependent hoppings and potentials. We identify the topological band insulating phases with extended bulk states and topological in-gap edge states by the topological invariants of the reduced systems, density of states, and the commutation of the transfer matrix. In addition, when the building blocks of the two multi-atomic cells have different number of the lattice sites, our numerical calculations demonstrate that the existences of the flat band and the macroscopic bound states in the continuum in the amorphous systems. Our findings uncover a new arena for the exploration of the topological band states beyond translational symmetry systems paradigm.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters: nonlinearities enter the weak-drive regime, and lead to correlated subradiant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitter arrays have emerged as important platforms in which strong light-matter interactions can be achieved and precisely controlled. In subwavelength regimes, they are characterised by a manifold of subradiant eigenstates, which can host novel quantum many-body states and are promising for several applications. Nevertheless, their excitation under a weak far-field driving is prevented by their subradiant nature. Consequently, the weak-drive regime has been widely regarded as a linear regime, well described by classical equations. In this work, we find that, suprisingly, the weak-drive regime is instead strongly non-linear for regular geometries, due to the important contribution of higher-order, resonant and momentum-conserving processes exciting subradiant states. Using a Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) we show that these processes lead to a steady state of interacting subradiant excitation pairs, with quantum correlations of two-mode squeezing and long-range character, realising a novel strongly-correlated driven-dissipative state. These findings have potential impact for non-linear optics and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Double sine-Gordon class of universal coarsening dynamics in a spin-1 Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, universal dynamics prevails in many different situations, from pattern coarsening to turbulence. A central longstanding problem concerns the development of a theory of coarsening that rests on the microscopic properties of the system and allows identifying the interaction mechanisms underlying a possible overarching universality class of the associated scaling dynamics. In quantum systems, this is complicated by the existence of nonlinear and topological excitations due to the compact nature of phase degrees of freedom. We show that the double sine-Gordon model as a noncompact low-energy effective model of the spin-1 Bose gas accounts for subdiffusive coarsening dynamics, identifying field configurations spread over multiple wells of the sinusoidal potential as a precondition for the slow scaling. This is in contrast to diffusion-type scaling which the model is known to exhibit as well, where field configurations are seen to not extend over more than two wells. Experimental observations of a spinor BEC support these characteristics, thus constituting a platform for the investigation of sine-Gordon dynamics. Our results point to a path towards a classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems on the basis of microscopic models.</description>

      <title>Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative effective field theory of the lowest Landau level superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the short-range interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.</description>

      <title>Quartet correlations near the surface of $ N = Z $ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Cooper quartet correlations in $ N = Z $ doubly-magic nuclei ($ {}^{40} \mathrm{Ca} $, $ {}^{100} \mathrm{Sn} $, and $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $). We first examine the quartet condensation fraction in infinite symmetric nuclear matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interaction responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated to be about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multinucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing.</description>
