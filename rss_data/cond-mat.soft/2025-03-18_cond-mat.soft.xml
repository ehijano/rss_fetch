      <title>Autonomous Small-Angle Scattering for Accelerated Soft Material Formulation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pace of soft material formulation (re)development and design is rapidly increasing as both consumers and new legislation demand products that do less harm to the environment while maintaining high standards of performance. To meet this need, we have developed the Autonomous Formulation Lab (AFL), a platform that can automatically prepare and measure the microstructure of liquid formulations using small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering and, soon, a variety of other techniques. Here, we describe the design, philosophy, tuning, and validation of our active learning agent that guides the course of AFL experiments. We show how our extensive in silico tuning results in an efficient agent that is robust to both the number of measurements and signal to noise variation. Finally, we experimentally validate our virtually tuned agent by addressing a model formulation problem: replacing a petroleum-derived component with a natural analog. We show that the agent efficiently maps both formulations and how post hoc analysis of the measured data reveals the opportunity for further specialization of the agent. With the tuned and proven active learning agent, our autonomously guided AFL platform will accelerate the pace of discovery of liquid formulations and help speed us towards a greener future.</description>

      <title>Dynamical field theories for biaxial liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase field crystal (PFC) models constitute central tools for a microscopic understanding of the dynamics of complex systems in soft matter physics. They have found widespread application in the modeling of the uniaxial orientational ordering of liquid crystals. However, only very limited progress has been made in applying them to the more complex cases of biaxial phases and biaxial particles. Here, we discuss the microscopic derivation of PFC models for biaxial liquid crystals. We illustrate it by presenting two models, one involving four scalar orientational order parameters relevant for the dynamics of biaxial particles, and one involving two scalar order parameters and a director field to describe biaxial phases in a three-dimensional uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. These models allow for an efficient simulation of spatially inhomogeneous biaxial orientational ordering dynamics. We also combine a microscopic and macroscopic approach to extract model coefficients for a full biaxial model from the microscopic derivation for a simple special case. This universal method also enables to perform derivations for other low-symmetry particles where, due to the complexity of the general case, this has not been previously attempted.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Fluid Polyamorphism Induced by Symmetrical Molecular Interconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid polyamorphism is the existence of multiple fluid-fluid phase transitions in a single-component substance. It can occur due to interconversion between two alternative molecular or supramolecular states. In this work, we investigate a special (``degenerate'') case of fluid polyamorphism, in which all three characteristic parameters of the interconversion equilibrium constant, i.e. the changes of energy, entropy, and volume, are zero. This feature of interconversion is typical for the Ising spin model of ferromagnets but is also observed in a polyamorphic chiral fluid mixture of interconverting enantiomers. To investigate the consequences of interconversion's degeneration for fluid polyamorphism, we have performed a meanfield analysis and 3D Monte Carlo simulations of a compressible binary lattice with interconverting species (referred to as the ``blinking-checkers model''), which generally demonstrates the existence of both liquid-gas and liquid-liquid transitions. By tuning the interaction parameters, we have demonstrated that, in the degenerate interconverting case, a coupling between the fraction of interconversion (a vector-like nonconserved order parameter) and the total density (a scalar conserved order parameter) may produce a symmetrical tricritical point. At this point, the line of second-order transitions between two fluids, ``disordered'' (with 50:50 interconversion) and ``ordered'' (with temperature and pressure dependent interconversion fraction), is terminated by first-order transitions between the fluid states. This point exhibits the typical features of symmetrical tricritical points as observed in a superfluid mixture of helium isotopes and in some magnetic materials. We also show that the transition between the ordered and disordered fluid could occur in either the liquid or the gaseous phase.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods for unraveling inter-particle potentials in colloidal suspensions: A comparative study for two-dimensional suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare three model-free numerical methods for inverting structural data to obtain interaction potentials, namely iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI), test-particle insertion (TPI), and a machine-learning (ML) approach called ActiveNet. Three archetypal models of two-dimensional colloidal systems are used as test cases: Weeks--Chandler--Anderson short-ranged repulsion, the Lennard-Jones potential, and a repulsive shoulder interaction with two length scales. Additionally, data on an experimental suspension of colloidal spheres are acquired by optical microscopy and used to test the inversion methods. The methods have different merits. IBI is the only choice when the radial distribution function is known but particle coordinates are unavailable. TPI requires snapshots with particle positions and can extract both pair- and higher-body potentials without the need for simulation. The ML approach can only be used when particles can be tracked in time and it returns the force rather than the potential. However, it can unravel pair interactions from any one-body forces (such as drag or propulsion) and does not rely on equilibrium distributions for its derivation. Our results may serve as a guide when a numerical method is needed for application to experimental data, and as a reference for further development of the methodology itself.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity and multibody interactions in acoustically levitated particle systems: A three body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active fluids and active solids the constituents individually generate movement by each extracting energy from their environment or from their own source. Non-reciprocal interactions among these active constituents then enable novel collective behavior that often can be strikingly counterintuitive. However, non-reciprocity in these cases typically requires that the interacting bodies have different physical properties or it needs to be programmed explicitly into all pairwise interactions. Here we show that collective activity in a driven system can emerge spontaneously through multibody nonreciprocal forces, even if all bodies are individually non-active and have identical properties. We demonstrate this with as few as three identical spheres, acoustically levitated in air, which exhibit collective activity as they interact through non-pairwise forces: similar to the classic gravitational three-body problem, the interaction between two spheres depends sensitively on the relative position of the third sphere. Non-reciprocity arises naturally from both near-field sound scattering and microstreaming forces among the spheres. The underdamped dynamics in air furthermore make it possible to go beyond collective center-of-mass propulsion or rotation and observe internal, engine-like reconfigurations that follow limit cycles. These findings open up new possibilities for self-assembly, where now multibody interactions not only determine the resulting structure but also drive the spontaneously emerging dynamics.</description>

      <title>Power Spectra of Velocity Fluctuations in Granular Heap Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study used Speckle Visibility Spectroscopy to examine velocity fluctuations in a three-dimensional granular heap flow, where the mean velocity profile consists of a fast-flow surface layer and a creep layer beneath. The velocity spectra follow power-law scalings, $E(f) \propto f^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \approx -0.85$ in the surface flow layer -- matching the Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) model with open boundaries ($\alpha \approx -0.95$). In the creep layer, $\alpha$ decreases with depth, reaching $\alpha \approx -1.5$ at approximately 55 mean particle diameters, consistent with the SOC model with closed boundaries ($\alpha \approx -1.58$). Analysis of the fluctuation velocity distributions offers additional insights into the microscopic origins of the spectrum's characteristics. These findings help resolve the long-standing puzzle of flow localization in gravity-driven granular flows despite a constant shear stress-to-pressure ratio throughout the material.</description>

      <title>Impact and spreading dynamics of a drop of fiber suspension on a solid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a liquid modifies the impact and spreading dynamics of a drop on a hydrophilic substrate. This difference in spreading dynamics is attributed to the increase in the suspension's viscosity caused by the particles. Similarly, anisotropic non-Brownian particles, such as fibers, also increase the bulk viscosity. In addition to the fiber diameter, D, the length, L, which determines the aspect ratio A = L/D, is crucial in controlling the fiber suspension viscosity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the drop impact of fiber suspensions with different volume fractions will result in a similar modification of the spreading dynamics. To investigate the impact and spreading dynamics, we prepared suspensions of fibers with an aspect ratio A = 12 at different volume fractions, spanning the dilute, semi-dilute, and dense concentration regimes. Additionally, we conducted a subset of experiments with aspect ratios A = 4 and A = 20. Furthermore, we characterized the thickness of the resulting droplet film (the coating) and the orientation of fibers after the spreading dynamics reached a steady state. The presence of fibers results in a decrease in the final droplet size, as an increase in volume fraction leads to an increase in the suspension viscosity. To rationalize these results, we used a modified equation, originally developed for spherical particles, which incorporates the suspension viscosity. Furthermore, we observed that volume fraction plays only a weak role in controlling splashing. However, it is crucial in determining the final thickness and resulting fiber coating. We also used a novel approach to quantify the final fiber orientation and showed that the resulting distribution is anisotropic within the quantified range.</description>

      <title>Shear jamming transition in alternating shear rotation for frictional and frictionless suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternating shear rotations in dense suspensions have recently shown the ability to reduce both viscosity and dissipation per strain (at a fixed global shear rate). Here, we study alternating shear rotation, with extensive numerical simulations, at various angles and up to their corresponding jamming points. For increasing shear rotation angles, we find that the jamming point is continuously shifted to higher packing fractions for frictional particles, while it remains constant for frictionless particles. As a consequence, the alternating shear rotation is unable to reduce the dissipation per strain for suspensions composed of frictionless particles. We detail the individual contributions, hydrodynamic or contact, to the shear stress, being uncharted for this protocol. As the angle of rotation increases, the average contact stress decreases. However, we find that the hydrodynamics shows the opposite trend, instead increasing with increasing angle. Hence, hydrodynamic stress will dominate up to much higher packing fractions as the angle of rotation increases. In addition, we report how the microstructure varies and establish a one-to-one mapping between the contact number and its contribution to the total stress for both frictionless and frictional particles.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Design of Floppy Modes and Frustrated Loops in Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials are a promising platform for a range of applications, from shock absorption to mechanical computing. These functionalities typically rely on floppy modes or mechanically frustrated loops, both of which are difficult to design. Here, we introduce a combinatorial approach that allows to create an arbitrarily large number of floppy modes and frustrated loops. The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling, and we utilize the designability of floppy chains and frustrated loops to demonstrate matrix-vector multiplication in materia.</description>

      <title>Entropic bottlenecks to nematic ordering in an $RP^{2}$ apolar spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lebwohl-Lasher model of liquid crystals with (d = 2, n = 3) describes interacting apolar spins, with an $RP^{2}$ order-parameter topology. Simulations with a modified Wang-Landau Monte Carlo protocol, that includes a density of states (DoS) factor, had previously found a zero latent-heat transition at $T=T_{n}$ to a novel nematic order, coexisting with unbound defects whose binding is completed only on cooling. We find through this entropically augmented MC protocol, that there is a deep dip in the DoS at an energy preceding global ordering, reflecting 'sparse' intermediate configurations, or entropy barriers. The narrow entropic bottleneck induces a cusp in the initially rising nematic correlation length, at a micro-canonical 'precursor' temperature $T=T_{p}$. A finite-scale cooperativity of defects and nematic clusters penetrates the bottleneck at $T_{p}$ to enable a third-order phase transition at a lower $T_{n}$: a rare pathway, overlooked by energy-only acceptance protocols.</description>

      <title>Engineering tunable fractional Shapiro steps in colloidal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shapiro steps are quantized plateaus in the velocity-force or velocity-torque curve of a driven system, when its speed remains constant despite an increase in the driving force. For microscopic particles driven across a sinusoidal potential, integer Shapiro steps have been observed. By driving a single colloidal particle across a time-modulated, non-sinusoidal periodic optical landscape, we here demonstrate that fractional Shapiro steps emerge in addition to integer ones. Measuring the particle position via individual particle tracking, we reveal the underlying microscopic mechanisms that produce integer and fractional steps and demonstrate how these steps can be controlled by tuning the shape and driving protocol of the optical potential. The flexibility offered by optical engineering allows us to generate wide ranges of potential shapes and to study, at the single-particle level, synchronization behavior in driven soft condensed matter systems.</description>

Abstract: Analytical relations for the glass transition temperature, $T_g$, and the crystal melting temperature, $T_m$, are developed on the basis of nonaffine lattice dynamics. The proposed relations explain: (i) the seemingly universal factor of $\approx 2/3$ difference between glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the corresponding crystal, and (ii) the recent empirical discovery that both $T_g$ and $T_m$ are proportional to the liquid fragility $m$ divided by the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ of the solid.</description>

      <title>3D morphology formation in a mixture of three differently averse components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Film formation from solvent evaporation in polymer ternary solutions is relevant for several technological applications, such as the fabrication of organic solar cells. The performance of the final device will strongly depend on the internal morphology of the obtained film, which, in turn, is affected by the processing conditions. We are interested in modeling morphology formation in 3D for ternary mixtures using both a lattice model and its continuous counterpart in the absence of evaporation. In our previous works, we found that, in 2D, both models predict the existence of two distinct regimes: (i) a low-solvent regime, characterized by two interpenetrated domains of the two polymers, and (ii) a high-solvent regime, where isolated polymer domains are dispersed in the solvent background. In the significantly more intriguing 3D case, we observe a comparable scenario both for the discrete and the continuous model. The lattice model reveals its ability to describe morphology formation even in the high solvent content 3D case, in which the three-dimensional nature of space could have prevented cluster formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conical microfluidic channels filled with electrolytes exhibit volatile memristive behavior, offering a promising foundation for energy-efficient, neuromorphic computing. Here, we integrate these iontronic channels as additional nonlinear element in nonlinear Shinriki-inspired oscillators and demonstrate that they exhibit alternating chaotic and non-chaotic dynamics across a broad frequency range. Exploiting this behavior, we construct XOR and NAND gates by coupling three "Memriki" oscillators, and we further realize the full set of standard logic gates through combinations of NAND gates. Our results establish a new paradigm for iontronic computing and open avenues for scalable, low-power logical operations in microfluidic and bio-inspired systems.</description>

Abstract: Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Exceptions to the Ratchet Principle in active and passive stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "ratchet principle" asserts that non-equilibrium systems which violate parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents. As recently shown, there are exceptions to this principle, due to the existence of hidden time-reversal symmetry or bulk momentum conservation. For underdamped and overdamped Brownian dynamics, we show how thermal fluctuations cannot power the momentum sources required to sustain steady ratchet currents, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to an inhomogeneous temperature field. While Active Brownian and Run-and-Tumble particles display interaction-induced ratchet currents in asymmetric activity landscapes, we show that this is not the case for Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles: not all inhomogeneous active fluctuations lead to net momentum sources. For each of the systems considered in this article, we numerically test for the emergence of interaction-induced ratchet currents. We then characterize time-reversal (as)symmetry in position space using a combination of path-integral and operator methods. When the existence of effective momentum conservation is ruled out, we develop perturbation theories to characterize the onset of interaction-induced currents.</description>

      <title>Exact Results in Stochastic Processes with Division, Death, and Diffusion: Spatial Correlations, Marginal Entropy Production, and Macroscopic Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional active turbulence in microswimmer suspensions: simulations and modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active turbulence is a paradigmatic and fascinating example of self-organized motion at large scales occurring in active matter. We employ massive hydrodynamic simulations of suspensions of resolved model microswimmers to tackle the phenomenon in semi-dilute conditions at a mesoscopic level. We measure the kinetic energy spectrum and we detect a $k^{-3}$ power law regime. The velocity distributions are of L\'evy type, a distinct difference with inertial turbulence. Furthermore, we propose a reduced order dynamical deterministic model for active turbulence, inspired to shell models for classical turbulence, whose numerical and analytical study confirms the spectrum powerlaw observed in the simulations and reveals hints of a non-Gaussian, intermittent, physics of active turbulence. Direct numerical simulations and modelling also agree in pointing to a phenomenological picture whereby, in the absence of an energy cascade \`a la Richardson forbidden by the low Reynolds number regime, it is the coupling between fluid velocity gradients and bacterial orientation that gives rise to a multiscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase transition.We further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately constant.This constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via nonlocal visual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09917v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Correlations under Temperature Gradients: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Simple Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fluids under temperature gradients, long-range correlations (LRCs) emerge generically, leading to enhanced density fluctuations. This phenomenon, characterized by the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the static structure factor (where $\boldsymbol{q}$ is the wavenumber), has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, they remain unexplored in Hamiltonian particle systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This Letter reports the first MD study to provide unambiguous observations of the LRCs. We demonstrate this by three distinct approaches: (1) measuring the static structure factor and directly observing the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence characterizing the LRCs; (2) detecting the corresponding $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the dynamic structure factor; (3) establishing a quantitative agreement between MD results and predictions from fluctuating hydrodynamics, the phenomenological theory that predicts the LRCs. Our findings demonstrate that MD simulations offer a powerful complementary tool to theoretical and experimental investigations of LRCs.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Previous simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.</description>

      <title>Flow birefringence of shear-thinning fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</description>
