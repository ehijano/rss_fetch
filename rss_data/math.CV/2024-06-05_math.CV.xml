      <title>On convergence of homeomorphisms with inverse modulus inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied homeomorphisms that satisfy the Poletsky-type inverse inequality in the domain of the Euclidean space. It is proved that the uniform limit of the family of such homeomorphisms is either a homeomorphism into the Euclidean space, or a constant in the extended Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>On the hypergeometric function and families of holomorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine one two-parameter family of sets consisting of functions holomorphic in the unit disk, previously investigated by several mathematicians. We focus on the set-theoretic properties of this family, identify the general form of filtrations within it, and discover that it is not a lattice. This insight motivates us to introduce a refined concept of quasi-infima and quasi-suprema, and to establish their complete description.
  Unexpectedly, some new properties of the Gau\ss\ hypergeometric function play a crucial role in our investigation.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional analogs of the Fekete--Szeg\"{o} functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Fekete--Szeg\"{o} type mapping in the open unit ball of a complex Banach space. % and study its geometric and analytical properties. All previously studied modifications of the Fekete--Szeg\"{o} functional are either special cases or `components' of the mapping we introduce.
  The study involves the examination of transforms of the Fekete--Szeg\"o mapping under specific transformations applied to given holomorphic mappings.
  We show that for a mapping $f$, the third order Fr\'eshet derivative of the inverse mapping $f^{-1}$ and of elements of the semigroup generated by $f$ can be expressed in terms of the Fekete--Szeg\"{o} mapping. Estimates of the Fekete--Szeg\"o mapping over some subclasses of semigroup generators and of starlike mappings are also presented.</description>

      <title>Non-linear resolvents of holomorphically accretive mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new results on holomorphically accretive mappings and their resolvents defined on the open unit ball of a complex Banach space.
  We employ a unified approach to examine various properties of non-linear resolvents by applying a distortion theorem we have established. This method enables us to prove a covering result and to establish the accretivity of resolvents along with estimates of the squeezing ratio. Furthermore, we prove that under certain mild conditions, a non-linear resolvent is a starlike mapping of a specified order.
  As a key tool, we first introduce a refined version of the inverse function theorem for mappings satisfying so-called one-sided estimates.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear resolvents in the unit disk: geometry and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a unified approach to the study of geometric and dynamic properties of nonlinear resolvents of holomorphic generators.
  The idea is to apply the distortion theorem we have established. This method allows us to find order of spirallikeness and of strong starlikeness of resolvents and remove all the restrictions for resolvents to admit quasiconformal extension to the complex plane $\C$.
  In addition, we use this method to establish the uniform convergence of the resolvent family on the whole unit disk and obtain some characteristics of semigroups generated by these resolvents.</description>

      <title>Reproducing Kernel Thesis of Hankel Operators on Weighted Hardy Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundedness of Hankel operators between two weighted spaces, with Muckenhoupt weights. In particular, we consider whether the Reproducing Kernel Thesis for Hankel operators generalizes to the case of two different weights. There, Hankel operators are bounded on the Hardy space if and only if they are bounded when tested on reproducing kernel functions. The supremum of testing the Hankel operator on this special class of functions is called the Garsia norm of the symbol of the Hankel operator, known to be equivalent to the BMO norm of the operator. We formulate a two-weight version of the Garsia norm and prove that testing the Hankel operator on the same reproducing kernel functions and measuring the norm in the two-weight setting is sufficient to prove that the operator is bounded. In the process,we prove that the Garsia norm is equivalent to the weighted Garsia norm, when two weights are the same, and we prove the two-weight version of the Carleson embedding theorem.</description>

      <title>Projections onto $L^p$-Bergman spaces of Reinhardt Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, we emulate the Bergman projection on Reinhardt domains by using a Banach-space basis of $L^p$-Bergman space. The construction gives an integral kernel generalizing the ($L^2$) Bergman kernel. The operator defined by the kernel is shown to be absolutely bounded projection on the $L^p$-Bergman space on a class of domains where the $L^p$-boundedness of the Bergman projection fails for certain $p \neq 2$. As an application, we identify the duals of these $L^p$-Bergman spaces with weighted Bergman spaces.</description>

      <title>Splitting aspects of holomorphic distributions with locally free tangent sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we mainly deal with a two-dimensional singular holomorphic distribution $\mathcal{D}$ defined on $M$, in the two situations $M=\mathbb{P}^n$ or $M=(\mathbb{C}^n,0)$, tangent to a one-dimensional foliation $\mathcal{G}$ on $M$, and whose tangent sheaf $T_{\mathcal{D}}$ is locally free. We provide sufficient conditions on $\mathcal{G}$ so that there is another one-dimensional foliation $\mathcal{H}$ on $M$ tangent to $\mathcal{D}$, such that their respective tangent sheaves satisfy the splitting relation $T_{\mathcal{D}}=T_{\mathcal{G}} \oplus T_{\mathcal{H}}$. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a codimension one holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^3$ with locally free tangent sheaf and tangent to a nontrivial holomorphic vector field on $\mathbb{P}^3$, then $T_{\mathcal{F}}$ splits. Some division results for vector fields and differential forms are also obtained.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Three-Forms on Symplectic Six-Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometries associated with 3-forms of various orbital types on a symplectic 6-manifold. We show that there are extremely rich geometric structures attached to certain unstable 3-forms arising naturally from degeneration of Calabi-Yau structures, which in turn provides us a new perspective towards the SYZ conjecture. We give concrete examples and demonstrate that the limiting behavior of the Type IIA flow can be used to detect canonical geometric structures on symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method - named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) - was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good global convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis, by combining with de Bruijn -Newman's constant. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>
