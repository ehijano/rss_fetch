      <title>Resonance Complexity Theory and the Architecture of Consciousness: A Field-Theoretic Model of Resonant Interference and Emergent Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Resonance Complexity Theory (RCT), which proposes that consciousness emerges from stable interference patterns of oscillatory neural activity. These patterns, shaped by recursive feedback and constructive interference, must exceed critical thresholds in complexity, coherence, gain, and fractal dimensionality to give rise to conscious experience. The resulting spatiotemporal attractors encode subjective awareness as dynamic resonance structures distributed across the neural field, enabling large-scale integration without symbolic representation or centralized control.
  To formalize this idea, we define the Complexity Index (CI), a composite metric that synthesizes four core properties of conscious systems: fractal dimensionality (D), signal gain (G), spatial coherence (C), and attractor dwell time (tau). These elements are combined multiplicatively to capture the emergence and persistence of structured, integrative neural states.
  To test the theory empirically, we developed a biologically inspired yet minimal neural field simulation composed of radial wave sources emitting across a continuous 2D space. The system exhibits recursive constructive interference, producing coherent, attractor-like excitation patterns without external input, regional coding, or imposed structure. These patterns meet the theoretical thresholds for CI and reflect the core dynamics predicted by RCT.
  The findings demonstrate that resonance-based attractors -- and by extension, consciousness-like dynamics -- can arise purely from the physics of wave interference. RCT thus offers a unified, dynamical framework for modeling awareness as an emergent property of organized complexity in oscillatory systems.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The partial integrability of the Kuramoto model is often thought to be restricted to identically connected oscillators or groups thereof. Yet, the exact connectivity prerequisites for having constants of motion on more general graphs have remained elusive. Using spectral properties of the Koopman generator, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of distinct constants of motion in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase lags on any weighted, directed, signed graph. This reveals a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities. Furthermore, we identify Lie symmetries that generate new constants of motion. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical application of Koopman's framework to nonlinear dynamics on complex networks.</description>

      <title>The influence of data gaps and outliers on resilience indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resilience, or stability, of major Earth system components is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic pressures, demanding reliable early warning signals for abrupt and irreversible regime shifts. Widely used data-driven resilience indicators based on variance and autocorrelation detect `critical slowing down', a signature of decreasing stability. However, the interpretation of these indicators is hampered by poorly understood interdependencies and their susceptibility to common data issues such as missing values and outliers. Here, we establish a rigorous mathematical analysis of the statistical dependency between variance- and autocorrelation-based resilience indicators, revealing that their agreement is fundamentally driven by the time series' initial data point. Using synthetic and empirical data, we demonstrate that missing values substantially weaken indicator agreement, while outliers introduce systematic biases that lead to overestimation of resilience based on temporal autocorrelation. Our results provide a necessary and rigorous foundation for preprocessing strategies and accuracy assessments across the growing number of disciplines that use real-world data to infer changes in system resilience.</description>
