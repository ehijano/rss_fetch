      <title>An Analysis of the Relationship Between the Characteristics of Innovative Consumers and the Degree of Serious Leisure in User Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between the concept of serious leisure and user innovation. We adopted the characteristics of innovative consumers identified by Luthje (2004)-product use experience, information exchange, and new product adoption speed-to analyze their correlation with serious leisure engagement. The analysis utilized consumer behavior survey data from the "Marketing Analysis Contest 2023" sponsored by Nomura Research Institute, examining the relationship between innovative consumer characteristics and the degree of serious leisure (Serious Leisure Inventory and Measure: SLIM). Since the contest data did not directly measure innovative consumer characteristics or serious leisure engagement, we established alternative variables for quantitative analysis. The results showed that the SLIM alternative variable had positive correlations with diverse product experiences and early adoption of new products. However, no clear relationship was found with information exchange among consumers. These findings suggest that serious leisure practice may serve as a potential antecedent to user innovation. The leisure career perspective of the serious leisure concept may capture the motivations of user innovators that Okada and Nishikawa (2019) identified.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences with Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider identification of average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) within the difference-in-differences (DiD) framework in the presence of endogenous sample selection. First, we establish that the usual DiD estimand fails to recover meaningful treatment effects, even if selection and treatment assignment are independent. Next, we partially identify the ATT for individuals who are always observed post-treatment regardless of their treatment status, and derive bounds on this parameter under different sets of assumptions about the relationship between sample selection and treatment assignment. Extensions to the repeated cross-section and two-by-two comparisons in the staggered adoption case are explored. Furthermore, we provide identification results for the ATT of three additional empirically relevant latent groups by incorporating outcome mean dominance assumptions which have intuitive appeal in applications. Finally, two empirical illustrations demonstrate the approach's usefulness by revisiting (i) the effect of a job training program on earnings(Calonico &amp; Smith, 2017) and (ii) the effect of a working-from-home policy on employee performance (Bloom, Liang, Roberts, &amp; Ying, 2015).</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Bayesian Difference-in-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies semiparametric Bayesian inference for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) within the difference-in-differences research design. We propose two new Bayesian methods with frequentist validity. The first one places a standard Gaussian process prior on the conditional mean function of the control group. We obtain asymptotic equivalence of our Bayesian estimator and an efficient frequentist estimator by establishing a semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorem. The second method is a double robust Bayesian procedure that adjusts the prior distribution of the conditional mean function and subsequently corrects the posterior distribution of the resulting ATT. We establish a semiparametric BvM result under double robust smoothness conditions; i.e., the lack of smoothness of conditional mean functions can be compensated by high regularity of the propensity score, and vice versa. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian DiD methods exhibit strong finite-sample performance compared to existing frequentist methods. Finally, we outline an extension to difference-in-differences with multiple periods and staggered entry.</description>
