      <title>On the origin of the gamma-ray burst GRB221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a bright and rare burst, GRB20221009A, showing through NED data that the angular distance between GRB221009A and the supernova SN 2022xiw is almost the same angular separation with galactic objects, i.e., the SN-GRB connection at z = 0.151 is not robust. Gamma rays with up to 18 TeV detected in association with the GRB constrain the attenuation to which they are subject at cosmological distances. GR221009A is out of scale relative to other long-lasting GRBs and comes from a region with an excess of soft gamma repeaters (SGR), suggesting that GRB221009A is a giant SGR, with energy release Eiso aproximately 10^{44} erg. The GRBs propagation across the galactic plane reinforces this assumption.</description>

      <title>Stellar-mass black-hole binaries in LISA: characteristics and complementarity with current-generation interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black-hole binaries are the most numerous gravitational-wave sources observed to date. Their properties make them suitable for observation both by ground- and space-based detectors. Starting from synthetic catalogues constructed based on observational constraints from ground-based detectors, we explore the detection rates and the characteristic parameters of the stellar-mass black-hole binaries observable by LISA during their inspiral, using signal-to-noise ratio thresholds as a detection criterion. We find that only a handful of these sources will be detectable with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 8: about 5 sources on average in 4 years of mission duration, among which only one or two are multiband ones (i.e. merging in less than 15 years). We find that detectable sources have chirp mass $10 M_\odot\lesssim \mathcal{M}_c\lesssim 100 M_\odot$, residual time-to-coalescence $4\mathrm{yr}\lesssim \tau_c\lesssim 100 \mathrm{yr}$, and redshift $z\lesssim 0.1$, much closer than those observed up to now by ground-based detectors. We also explore correlations between the number of LISA detectable sources and the parameters of the population, suggesting that a joint measurement with the stochastic signal might be informative of the population characteristics. By performing parameter estimation on a subset of sources from the catalogues, we conclude that, even if LISA measurements will not be directly informative on the population due to the low number of resolvable sources, it will characterise a few, low-redshift candidates with great precision. Furthermore, we construct for the first time the LISA waterfall plot for low chirp mass, and demonstrate that LISA will also be able to discriminate and characterize, through very precise parameter estimation, a population of binaries with higher masses, $\mathcal{M}_c\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3) M_\odot$, if it exists.</description>

      <title>Impact of the observation frequency coverage on the significance of a gravitational wave background detection in PTA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations gather high-precision timing measurements of pulsars with the aim of detecting gravitational wave (GW) signals. A major challenge lies in the identification and characterization of the different sources of noise that may hamper their sensitivity to GWs. The presence of time-correlated noise that resembles the target signal might give rise to degeneracies that can directly impact the detection statistics. In this work, we focus on the covariance that exists between a "chromatic" dispersion measure (DM) noise and an "achromatic" stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). "Chromatic" associated to the DM noise means that its amplitude depends on the frequency of the incoming pulsar photons measured by the radio-telescope. Several frequency channels are then required to accurately characterise its chromatic features and when the coverage of incoming frequency is poor, it becomes impossible to disentangle chromatic and achromatic noise contributions. In this paper, we explore this situation by injecting realistic GWB into 100 realizations of two mock versions of the second data release (DR2) of the European PTA (EPTA), characterized by different frequency coverage. The first dataset is a faithful copy of DR2, in which the first half of the data is dominated by only one frequency channel of observation; the second one is identical except for a more homogeneous frequency coverage across the full dataset. We show that for 91% of the injections, a better frequency coverage leads to an improved statistical significance (~1.3dex higher log Bayes factor on average) of the GWB and a better characterization of its properties. We propose a metric to quantify the degeneracy between DM and GWB parameters and show that it is correlated with a loss of significance for the recovered GWB and an increase in the GWB bias towards a higher and flatter spectral shape.</description>

      <title>IceCube AGN Neutrino candidate PKS 1717+177: Dark deflector bends nuclear jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BL Lac Object PKS 1717+177 has been identified as potential neutrino-emitting AGN in the point source stacking analysis of IceCube data. We explore peculiarities in the morphology and kinematics of the jet and examine multi-wavelength light curves for distinctive effects which might allow to pinpoint a likely neutrino generation mechanism. We re-modeled 34 high resolution radio interferometric Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations obtained at 15 GHz (between 1999/12/27 and 2023/05/03). A correlation and periodicity analysis of optical KAIT and Tuorla data, as well as for Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data has been performed. The nuclear jet appears deflected and bent at about 0.5 mas distance from the radio core by an encounter with a dark, unseen object. The deviation of the jet evolves over 23.5 years from a simple apparent bend into a significantly meandering structure with increasing amplitude: a zig-zag line. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the temporal evolution of a jet deviation can be traced. The turning point shifts with time and the jet seems to brighten up almost periodically at the point of deviation. The radio core as well as the jet contribute approximately equally to the total flux-density at 15 GHz. We discuss scenarios which could explain the complex jet bending and quasi-regular flaring. We propose that the jet could either be deflected by the magnetosphere of a second massive black hole, by the pressure gradient due to a circumnuclear dense cloud, or via gravitational lensing by an intervening black hole.</description>

      <title>COBIPULSE: A Systematic Search for Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here the results obtained from a systematic optical photometric survey aimed at finding new compact binary millisecond pulsars (also known as "spiders"): the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch (COBIPULSE). We acquired multi-band optical images over one year around $33$ unidentified Fermi-LAT sources, selected as pulsar candidates based on their curved GeV spectra and steady $\gamma$-ray emission. We present the discovery of four optical variables coinciding with the Fermi sources 3FGL J0737.2$-$3233, 3FGL J2117.6$+$3725 (two systems in this field) and 3FGL J2221.6$+$6507, which we propose as new candidate spider systems. Indeed, they all show optical flux modulation consistent with orbital periods of $0.3548(5) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.25328(6) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.441961(2) \ \mathrm{d}$, and $0.165(4) \ \mathrm{d}$, respectively, with amplitudes $\gtrsim 0.3 \ \mathrm{mag}$ and colors compatible with companion star temperatures of $5000$--$6000 \ \mathrm{K}$. These properties are consistent with the "redback" sub-class of spider pulsars. If confirmed as a millisecond pulsar, 3FGL J0737.2$-$3233 will be the closest known spider to Earth ($D=659_{-20}^{+16} \ \mathrm{pc}$, from Gaia-DR3 parallax). We searched and did not find any X-ray sources matching our four candidates, placing $3\sigma$ upper limits of $\sim10^{31}$--$10^{32} \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($0.3$--$10 \ \mathrm{keV}$) on their soft X-ray luminosities. We also present and discuss other multi-wavelength information on our spider candidates, from infrared to X-rays.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational waves: review and lessons learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has provided a new tool to study the Universe, with the scientific return enriched when combined with established probes: electromagnetic (EM) radiation and energetic particles. Since the groundbreaking detection in 2017 of merging neutron stars producing GW emission, a gamma-ray burst and an optical 'kilonova', the field has grown rapidly. At present, no additional neutron star mergers have been jointly detected in GW and EM radiation, but with upgrades in EM and GW facilities now is a chance to take stock of almost a decade of observations. We discuss the motivations for following up GW sources and the basic challenges of searching large areas for a rapidly-evolving EM signal. We examine how the kilonova counterpart to GW170817 was discovered and the association confirmed, and outline some of the key physics enabled by this discovery. We then review the status of EM searches since 2017, highlighting areas where more information (in GW alerts or catalogs) can improve efficiency, and discuss what we have learned about kilonovae despite the lack of further multi-messenger detections. We discuss upcoming facilities and the many lessons learned, considering also how these could inform searches for lensed mergers.</description>

      <title>A new look at the extragalactic Very High Energy sky: searching for TeV-emitting candidates among the X-ray bright, non-Fermi detected blazar population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-wavelength study of blazars selected from the 5th ROMABZCAT catalog. We selected from this sample a subsample of 2435 objects having at least one counterpart in one of the three main archival X-ray catalogs, which is, the fourth release of the XMM-Newton Survey Science Catalogue, the second release of the Chandra Source Catalog, and the second Swift X-ray Point Source catalog of detections by Swift-XRT, or in the recently released eROSITA-DE Data Release 1 catalog. We first searched for different multi-wavelength trends between sources with a Gamma-ray counterpart in the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalog (4FGL-DR4) and sources lacking one. We find that the non-4FGL sources are on average fainter both in the X-rays and in the radio with respect to the 4FGL-detected ones, but the two samples have similar X-ray-to-radio flux ratios, as well as synchrotron peak frequencies. We then focused on the 1007 non-Gamma-ray detected population, to determine if there is a sample of X-ray sources that could be TeV emitters. We find that a large number of sources, mostly BL Lacs or BL Lacs with host-galaxy contribution to the spectral energy distribution, have large synchrotron peak frequency and X-ray to radio flux ratio, two properties that characterize the vast majority of known TeV emitters. With respect to these known TeV emitters, our targets have X-ray fluxes ~1 order of magnitude fainter. We then computed the 0.2-12 keV and 20 GeV - 300 TeV fluxes for the known 5BZCAT TeV emitters, and determined the existence of a direct correlation between X-ray and TeV fluxes in the BL Lacs population. We used this trend to estimate the VHE flux of our targets, and found a promising sample of sources for follow-up observations with current or future, more sensitive, Cherenkov telescopes, first and foremost the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral-temporal Modelling of Two Young Pulsar Wind Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of a few young pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) have revealed their morphologies in some detail. Given the availability of spatio-spectral-temporal data, we use our multi-zone (1D) leptonic emission code to model the PWNe associated with G29.7-0.3 (Kes 75) and G21.5-0.9 (G21.5) and obtain (by-eye) constraints on additional model parameters compared to spectral-only modelling. Kes 75 is a Galactic composite supernova remnant (SNR) with an embedded pulsar, PSR J1846-0258. X-ray studies reveal rapid expansion of Kes 75 over the past two decades. PWN G21.5 is also a composite SNR, powered by PSR J1833-1034. For Kes 75, we study a sudden plasma bulk speed increase that may be due to the magnetar-like outbursts of the central pulsar. An increase of a few percent in this speed does not result in any significant change in the model outputs. For G21.5, we investigate different diffusion coefficients and pulsar spin-down braking indices. We can reproduce the broadband spectra and X-ray surface brightness profiles for both PWNe, and the expansion rate, flux over different epochs, and X-ray photon index vs epoch and central radius for Kes 75 quite well. The latter three features are also investigated for G21.5. Despite obtaining reasonable fits overall, some discrepancies remain, pointing to further model revision. We find similar values to overlapping parameters between our 1D code and those of an independent 0D dynamical code (TIDE). Future work will incorporate spatial data from various energy wavebands to improve model constraints.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of XTE J18014-338 yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars, which are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations. In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations indicates their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton observations of the peculiar Be X-ray binary A0538-66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A0538-66 is a neutron star/Be X-ray binary located in the Large Magellanic Cloud and, since its discovery in the seventies, it showed a peculiar behavior which makes it a unique object in the high-mass X-ray binaries scene: the extremely eccentric orbit (e=0.72), the short spin period of the neutron star (P=69 ms), the episodes of super-Eddington accretion. These characteristics contribute to a remarkable bursting activity that lasts from minutes to hours and increases the flux by a factor 10^3-10^4. In 2018, A0538-66 was observed by XMM-Newton in a particularly active state, characterized by a forest of short bursts lasting 0.7-50 seconds each. In this contribution we present a reanalysis of these observations. The timing analysis allowed us to distinguish between the epochs of direct accretion and propeller state, that do not correlate with the orbital position of the neutron star. The spectral analysis revealed that during the accretion regime three components (a soft one, a hard one, and a ~6.4-keV emission line) equally contribute to the overall emission, while the propeller regime is characterized by a single soft component. We discuss these findings in the context of spherical and disk accretion regimes, highlighting the similarities and the differences with other X-ray binary systems.</description>

      <title>A second radio flare from the tidal disruption event AT2020vwl: a delayed outflow ejection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a second radio flare from the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020vwl via long-term monitoring radio observations. Late-time radio flares from TDEs are being discovered more commonly, with many TDEs showing radio emission 1000s of days after the stellar disruption, but the mechanism that powers these late-time flares is uncertain. Here we present radio spectral observations of the first and second radio flares observed from the TDE AT2020vwl. Through detailed radio spectral monitoring, we find evidence for two distinct outflow ejection episodes, or a period of renewed energy injection into the pre-existing outflow. We deduce that the second radio flare is powered by an outflow that is initially slower than the first flare, but carries more energy and accelerates over time. Through modelling the long-term optical and UV emission from the TDE as arising from an accretion disc, we infer that the second radio outflow launch or energy injection episode occurred approximately at the time of peak accretion rate. The fast decay of the second flare precludes environmental changes as an explanation, while the velocity of the outflow is at all times too low to be explained by an off-axis relativistic jet. Future observations that search for any link between the accretion disc properties and late time radio flares from TDEs will aid in understanding what powers the radio outflows in TDEs, and confirm if multiple outflow ejections or energy injection episodes are common.</description>

      <title>Multi-band optical variability on diverse timescales of blazar 1E 1458.8+2249</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an analysis of the optical variability of the blazar 1E 1458.8+2249 on diverse timescales using multi-band observations, including observations in the optical BVRI bands carried out with the T60 and T100 telescopes from 2020 to 2023 and ZTF gri data from 2018 to 2023. On seven nights, we searched for intraday variability using the power-enhanced F-test and the nested ANOVA test, but no significant variability was found. The long-term light curve shows a variability behaviour in the optical BVRI bands with amplitudes of $\sim100\%$ and in the gri bands with amplitudes of $\sim120\%$, including short-term variability of up to $\sim1.1$ mag. Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the optical multi-band emissions without any time lag.From 62 nightly SEDs, we obtained spectral indices between 0.826 and 1.360, with an average of $1.128\pm0.063$. The relationships of both spectral indices and colour with respect to brightness indicate a mild BWB trend throughout the observation period, both intraday and long-term. We also performed a periodicity search using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle methods. A recurrent optical emission pattern with a quasi-periodicity of $\sim340$ days is detected in the combined V- and R-band light curves. The observational results indicate that the blazar 1E 1458.8+2249 has a complex variability, while emphasising the need for future observations to unravel its underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Mergers of compact objects with cores of massive stars: evolution, r-process and multi-messenger signatures</title>

Abstract: The study of massive binary systems has steadily progressed over the past decades, with increasing focus on their evolution, interactions and mergers, driven by improvements in computational modelling and observational techniques. In particular, when a binary system involves a massive giant and a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) that go through common envelope evolution (CEE), it might results in the merger of the compact object with the core of its giant companion, giving rise to various high energy astrophysical phenomena. We review the different evolutionary channels that lead to compact objects-core mergers, key physical processes with emphasis on the role of accretion physics, feasibility of r-process nucleosynthesis, expected observable electromagnetic, neutrinos and gravitational-waves (GWs) signatures, as well as potential correlation with detected core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and low luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). After presenting our current understanding of these mergers, we conclude discussing prospects for future advancements.</description>

      <title>McFacts III: Compact binary mergers from AGN disks over an entire synthetic universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) channel for the formation of binary black hole (BBH) mergers has been previously studied as a potential formation channel for the merging compact binaries observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) scientific collaboration. The first two papers in this series explored the McFACTS code for the evolution of black hole orbits in AGN accretion disks for individual galaxy models and described the characteristics of predicted BBH populations in realizations of those models (such as the correlation between mass ratio and aligned spin). In this work, we explore the impact of the properties of AGN host galaxies and assume an AGN lifetime and cosmological model for the density of AGN in a universe like our own. By sampling from an inferred population of AGN, we marginalize over galaxy mass to predict a population of BBH mergers observable by modern ground-based gravitational wave observatories. We find that for reasonable assumptions, AGN disk environments may account for massive BBH mergers such as GW190521 and GW190929_012149. We find that the majority of observable BBH mergers from our simulation are expected to originate in galaxies with a super-massive black hole between $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ and $10^{9.4}M_{\odot}$. We also find that if hierarchical mergers from AGN disks account for a substantial part of the LVK population, our current models require an AGN lifetime of 0.5 to 2.5 Myr.</description>

Abstract: Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are enshrouded by dust, and many are believed to host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which makes them unique objects for probing the coevolution of galaxies and SMBHs. We select and characterize DOGs in the $13\,deg^2$ XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS), leveraging the superb multiwavelength data from X-rays to radio. We select 3738 DOGs at $z\approx1.6-2.1$ in XMM-SERVS, while maintaining good data quality without introducing significant bias. This represents the largest DOG sample with thorough multiwavelength source characterization. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling shows DOGs are a heterogeneous population consisting of both normal galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our DOGs are massive ($\log M_\bigstar/M_\odot\approx10.7-11.3$), 174 are detected in X-rays, and they are generally radio-quiet systems. X-ray detected DOGs are luminous and are moderately to heavily obscured in X-rays. Stacking analyses for the X-ray undetected DOGs show highly significant average detections. Critically, we compare DOGs with matched galaxy populations. DOGs have similar AGN fractions compared with typical galaxy populations. X-ray detected DOGs have higher $M_\bigstar$ and higher X-ray obscuration, but they are not more star-forming than typical X-ray AGNs. The results potentially challenge the relevance of the merger-driven galaxy-SMBH coevolution framework for X-ray detected DOGs.</description>

Abstract: We report results from a 2018 pilot run to study the feasibility of nuclear fragmentation measurements with the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS. These results are important for the interpretation of the production of light secondary cosmic-ray nuclei (Li, Be, and B) in the Galaxy. The specific focus here is on cross sections important for the production of boron in the Galaxy from the interactions of $^{12}$C nuclei with hydrogen in the interstellar medium, including the contribution from the decay of the short-lived $^{11}$C fragments. The data were taken with the secondary $^{12}$C beam at beam momentum of 13.5 GeV/c per nucleon and two fixed targets, polyethylene (CH$_2$) and graphite (C), from which we derive the cross sections of carbon on hydrogen. We present the measurement of the fragmentation cross sections of $^{11}$C, $^{11}$B, and $^{10}$B as well as the mass- and charge-changing cross sections.</description>

      <title>The Density and Ionization Profile of Optically Dark and High Redshift GRBs Probed by X-ray Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The X-ray column density (NHX) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can probe the local environment of their progenitors over a wide redshift range. Previous work has suggested an increasing trend as a function of redshift. The relevance of the current analysis relies on investigating the selection bias method, such as the effect of the X-ray spectrum in high-redshift GRBs, which complicates the measurement of small NHX, have yet to be fully evaluated or discussed elsewhere. In this work, we evaluated these effects through simulations to define appropriate observational limits in the NHX versus redshift plane. We then applied a one-sided nonparametric method developed by Efron and Petrosian. Within the framework of this method, we investigated the redshift dependence of NHX and the local distribution function. Our results show that the evolution of NHX with redshift firmly exists with a significance of more than four sigma and follows a power law of $(1+z)^{1.39 (+0.22, -0.27)}$. Based on these analyses and previous studies, the GRB progenitor mass varies but is more massive in the high redshift environment and has a higher gas column density. This suggests that part of the luminosity evolution of GRBs, which has been widely reported, may be due to the evolution of the progenitor's mass. Using the same method, we demonstrate that optically dark GRBs show a consistent evolution as $(1+z)^{1.15(+0.67, -0.83)}$. By applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, it is shown that optically dark GRBs have statistically identical flux and photon index distributions compared to normal GRBs, but the NHX is systematically larger. This result suggests that the darkness of some GRB populations is not due to an intrinsic mechanism, but that a higher density surrounds them.</description>

      <title>Gravitational and electromagnetic Cherenkov radiation constraints in modified dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity, one could consider that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature at all energy scales. Following this spirit, modified dispersion relations have been used to encapsulate quantum gravity phenomenology. In the present work, we propose a class of Lorentz invariance violating phenomenological dispersion relations, which could be different for each particle species, to study the generalized vacuum Cherenkov radiation process. We identify the kinematic regions where the process is allowed and then compute the energy loss rate due to the emission of vacuum electromagnetic and gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Furthermore, we estimate constraints for the Lorentz invariance breaking parameters of protons and gravitons taking into account the existence (or absence) of vacuum gravitational Cherenkov radiation using ultra high energy cosmic ray detections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a stellar-mass black hole around an intermediate-mass slowly rotating Kerr black hole in the presence of gravitational radiation and a dark matter halo. The stellar-mass companion will inspiral towards the central black hole while emitting gravitational waves. The evolution is affected by the dynamical friction force caused by the presence of dark matter surrounding the intermediate-mass black hole at the core. Previous studies have shown that the presence of dark matter can be deduced from the gravitational waveforms. We explore the combined effects of slow-rotation of the central black hole and the presence of the dark matter halo around it on the system's gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>The effect of data-driving and relaxation model on magnetic flux rope evolution and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of data-driving on flux rope eruptivity in magnetic field simulations by analysing fully data-driven modelling results of active region (AR) 12473 and AR11176, as well as preforming relaxation runs for AR12473 (found to be eruptive). Here, the driving is switched off systematically at different time steps. We analyse the behaviour of fundamental quantities, essential for understanding the eruptivity of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). The data-driven simulations are carried out with the time-dependent magnetofrictional model (TMFM) for AR12473 and AR11176. For the relaxation runs, we employ the magnetofrictional method (MFM) and a zero-beta magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to investigate how significant the differences between the two relaxation procedures are when started from the same initial conditions. To determine the eruptivity of the MFRs, we calculate characteristic geometric properties, such as the cross-section, MFR height along with stability parameters, such as MFR twist and the decay index. For eruptive cases, we investigate the effect of sustained driving beyond the point of eruptivity on the MFR properties. We find that the fully-driven AR12473 MFR is eruptive while the AR11176 MFR is not. For the relaxation runs, we find that the MFM MFRs are eruptive when the driving is stopped around the flare time or later, while the MHD MFRs show eruptive behaviour even if the driving is switched off one and a half days before the flare occurs. We find that characteristic MFR properties can vary greatly even for the eruptive cases of different relaxation simulations. The results suggest that data driving can significantly influence the evolution of the eruption, with differences appearing even when the relaxation time is set to later stages of the simulation when the MFRs have already entered an eruptive phase.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the nature of the wind interaction in HD93205 based on multi-epoch X-ray observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the X-ray emission from massive binaries constitutes a relevant approach to investigate shock physics. The case of short period binaries may turn out to be quite challenging, especially in very asymmetric systems where the primary wind may overwhelm that of the secondary in the wind interaction. Our objective consists in providing an observational diagnostic of the X-ray behaviour of HD93205, that is a very good candidate to investigate these aspects. We analysed 31 epochs of XMM-Newton X-ray data spanning about two decades to investigate its spectral and timing behaviour. The X-ray spectrum is very soft along the full orbit, with a luminosity exclusively from the wind interaction region in the range of 2.3 -- 5.4\,$\times$10$^{32}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. The light curve peaks close to periastron, with a rather wide pre-periastron low-state coincident with the secondary's body hiding a part of the X-ray emitting region close to its surface. We determined a variability time scale of 6.0807\,$\pm$\,0.0013\,d, in full agreement with the orbital period. Making use of a one-dimensional approach to deal with mutual radiative effects, our results point to a very likely hybrid wind interaction, with a wind-photosphere occurring along most of the orbit, while a brief episode of wind-wind interaction may still develop close to apastron. Beside mutual radiative effects, the radiative nature of the shock that leads to some additional pre-shock obliquitity of the primary wind flow certainly explains the very soft emission. HD93205 constitutes a relevant target to investigate shock physics in short period, asymmetric massive binary systems, where various mutual radiative effects and radiative shocks concur to display an instructive soft X-ray behaviour. HD93205 should be considered as a valid, though challenging target for future three-dimensional modelling initiatives.</description>

      <title>High energy power-law tail in X-ray binaries spectrum and bulk Comptonization due to a conical outflow from a disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.04427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray binaries (XRBs) often exhibit a high energy power-law tail (HEP-tail) and these tails can be generated by bulk Comptonization (BMC) process with a free-fall bulk region onto the compact object. The radio emission (which is generated by synchrotron-emitting outflowing electrons) is also observed in all spectral states of XRBs. Interestingly, the variation of HEP-tail flux in different spectral states is similar to the variation of radio flux. We motivate to study the HEP-tail in BMC process with an outflowing medium. For this we consider collimated and conical (of opening angle $\theta_b$ with axis perpendicular to the accretion disk) outflow geometries. We simulate the BMC spectrum by using a Monte Carlo scheme. We find that the emergent spectrum has power-law tail (of photon index $\Gamma$ $&gt;$ 2 and with high energy cut-off $E_{c}$ $&gt;$ 200 keV) only for $\theta_b$ $\gtrsim$30 degree in conical outflow, while for either collimated or conical (with $\theta_b$ $&lt;$ 30degree) outflow these HEP-tail can be only generated when it is also found in thermal Comptonized spectra (i.e., at sufficiently high medium temperature). We describe the observed GRS 1915+105 spectrum for two classes $\chi$ and $\gamma$ in conical outflow, in both cases the estimated outflow speed is relativistic and the kinetic power of wind indicates that the HEP-tail can be generated at inner region of the accretion disk, like inner disk radio emission.</description>

      <title>Long-term study of the 2020 magnetar-like outburst of the young pulsar PSRJ1846-0258 in Kes 75</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetar-like activity has been observed in a large variety of neutron stars. PSR J1846-0258 is a young 327 ms radio-quiet pulsar with a large rotational power ($\sim 8 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and resides at the center of the supernova remnant Kes 75. It is one of the rare examples of a high magnetic field pulsar showing characteristics both of magnetars and radio pulsars, and can thus provide important clues on the differences in the emission mechanisms between these two classes. In 2006, PSR J1846-0258 was detected to undergo an outburst for the first time, accompanied by a large flux increase, millisecond X-ray bursts, significant spectral changes and a large timing glitch. In the period between May-June 2020, after fourteen years of quiescent stable emission, the source underwent a second magnetar-like outburst, which was followed up with several observations by NICER, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Swift. In this work, we report on the long-term timing and X-ray spectral properties of the source following the 2020 outburst, and place upper limits on any source activity at radio wavelengths. We demonstrate that the pulsed flux increased by a factor $&gt; 6$ during the outburst, followed by non-trivial variability in the spin-down rate. Our timing analysis shows that the spin frequency and its derivative are clearly affected by magnetospheric activity due to the outburst. We find hints for an oscillation in the frequency derivative with a timescale of 50-60 days, recovering later on to stable quiescence.</description>

      <title>Vetting quark-star models with gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new avenue for investigating the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in compact stars, which is an outstanding problem in astronomy and nuclear physics. In the future, next-generation (XG) GW detectors will be constructed, deemed to provide a large number of high-precision observations. We investigate the potential of constraining the EOS of quark stars (QSs) with high-precision measurements of mass $m$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ from the XG GW observatories. We adopt the widely-used bag model for QSs, consisting of four microscopic parameters: the effective bag constant $B_{\rm eff}$, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter $a_4$, the strange quark mass $m_s$, and the pairing energy gap $\Delta$. With the help of hierarchical Bayesian inference, for the first time we are able to infer the EOS of QSs combining multiple GW observations. Using the top 25 loudest GW events in our simulation, we find that, the constraints on $B_{\rm eff}$ and $\Delta$ are tightened by several times, while $a_4$ and $m_s$ are still poorly constrained. We also study a simplified 2-dimensional (2-d) EOS model which was recently proposed in literature. The 2-d model is found to exhibit significant parameter-estimation biases as more GW events are analyzed, while the predicted $m$-$\Lambda$ relation remains consistent with the full model.</description>

      <title>Analytic insight into the physics of SASI I. Shock instability in a non-rotating stellar core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the core collapse of a massive star just before its supernova explosion, the amplification of asymmetric motions by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) imprints on the neutrino flux and the gravitational waves a frequency signature carrying direct information on the explosion process. The physical interpretation of this multi-messenger signature requires a detailed understanding of the instability mechanism. A perturbative analysis is used to characterize the properties of SASI, and assess the effect of the region of neutronization above the surface of the proto-neutron star. The eigenfrequencies of the most unstable modes are compared to those obtained in an adiabatic approximation where neutrino interactions are neglected above the neutrinosphere. The differential system is solved analytically using a Wronskian method and approximated asymptotically for a large shock radius. The oscillation period of SASI is well fitted with a simple analytic function of the shock radius, the radius of maximum deceleration and the mass of the proto-neutron star. The oscillation period is weakly dependent on the parametrized cooling function which however affects the SASI growth rate. The general properties of SASI eigenmodes are described using an adiabatic model. In this approximation the eigenvalue problem is formulated as a self-forced oscillator. The forcing agent is the radial advection of baroclinic vorticity perturbations and entropy perturbations produced by the shock oscillation. The differential system defining the eigenfrequencies is reduced to a single integral equation. Its analytical approximation sheds light on the radially extended character of the region of advective-acoustic coupling. The simplicity of this adiabatic formalism opens new perspectives to investigate the effect of stellar rotation and non-adiabatic processes on SASI.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves Detected by a Burst Search in LIGO/Virgo's Third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Burst searches identify gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the detector data without use of a specific signal model, unlike the matched-filter searches that correlate data with simulated signal waveforms (templates). While matched filters are optimal for detection of known signals in the Gaussian noise, the burst searches can be more efficient in finding unusual events not covered by templates or those affected by non-Gaussian noise artifacts. Here, we report the detection of 3 gravitational wave signals that are uncovered by a burst search Coherent WaveBurst (cWB) optimized for the detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. They were found in the data from the LIGO/Virgo's third observing run (O3) with a combined significance of 3.6 $\sigma$. Each event appears to be a BBH merger not previously reported by the LIGO/Virgo's matched-filter searches. The most significant event has a reconstructed primary component in the upper mass gap ($m_1 = 70^{+36}_{-18}\,$M$_\odot$), and unusually low mass ratio ($m_2/m_1\sim0.3$), implying a dynamical or AGN origin. The 3 new events are consistent with the expected number of cWB-only detections in the O3 run ($4.8 \pm 2.1$), and belong to the stellar-mass binary population with the total masses in the $70-100$ M$_\odot$ range.</description>

      <title>Bounds on ALP-Mediated Dark Matter Models from Celestial Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the signals from axion-like particles (ALPs) as dark matter mediators from celestial objects such as neutron stars, brown dwarfs or white dwarfs. We consider the accumulation of dark matter inside the celestial objects using the multiscatter capturing process. The production of ALP from the dark matter annihilation can escape the celestial object and decay into gamma-rays and neutrinos before reaching the Earth. We investigate our model using gamma-ray observations from Fermi and H.E.S.S. and neutrino observations from IceCube and ANTARES. The effective Lagrangian approach allows us to place constraints on the ALP-photon and ALP-fermion couplings. In the gamma-ray channel, our results are able to rule out the existence of ALP with mass up to $\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV. On the other hand, the neutrino observations can be used to probe a higher mass range with ALP mass up to $\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Distinctive GWBs from eccentric inspiraling SMBH binaries with a DM spike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent detections of a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) from various pulsar-timing-array (PTA) observations have renewed the interest in the inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), whose population is believed to be the most promising candidate with possible generalizations from including either orbital eccentricity or dark matter (DM) spike. In this Letter, we show that the inclusion of both can further display distinctive features detectable in future PTA observations. With a typical initial eccentricity $e_0\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the inspiraling SMBHBs, even a shallow DM spike can easily drive the orbital eccentricity close to $1$, leaving behind a large turnover eccentricity when GWs begin to dominate the orbital circularization. In particular, the DM spike index $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ universally manifests itself in the characteristic strain by $h_c\sim f^{7/6-\gamma_\mathrm{sp}/3}$ in the far infrared and features a novel oscillation structure at low frequencies. Future PTA detection of such characteristics would be the smoking gun for the DM spike and even reveal the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Monopole acceleration in intergalactic magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the acceleration of magnetic monopoles in intergalactic magnetic fields. We demonstrate that monopoles with intermediate to low masses can be accelerated to relativistic velocities. This can significantly affect direct and indirect searches for magnetic monopoles. As an example, we show that the Parker bound is relaxed in the presence of intergalactic fields. We also find that a cosmic population of monopoles can produce significant backreaction on the intergalactic fields.</description>

      <title>Testing the Origins of Neutrino Mass with Supernova Neutrino Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown. Both the vacuum mass and the dark mass generated by the neutrino interaction with dark matter (DM) particles or fields can fit the current oscillation data. The dark mass squared is proportional to the DM number density and therefore varies on the galactic scale with much larger values around the Galactic Center. This affects the group velocity and the arrival time delay of core-collapse supernovae (SN) neutrinos. This time delay, especially for the $\nu_e$ neutronization peak with a sharp time structure, can be used to distinguish the vacuum and dark neutrino masses. For illustration, we explore the potential of DUNE which is sensitive to $\nu_e$. Our simulations show that DUNE can distinguish the two neutrino mass origins at more than $5\sigma\,$C.L., depending on the observed local value of neutrino mass, the neutrino mass ordering, the DM density profile, and the SN location.</description>

      <title>Mass function of stellar black holes as revealed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ninety gravitational wave events have been detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and are released in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Among these events, 83 cases are definitely binary black hole mergers since the masses of all the objects involved significantly exceed the upper limit of neutron stars. The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a pre-merger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a post-merger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis on these two samples. The non-parametric $\tau$ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as $\rho(z) \propto z^{-2.06}$ -- $z^{-2.12}$ based on the two samples. Implications of these findings on the origin of black holes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Searching Accretion-Enhanced Dark Matter Annihilation Signals in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reanalyzes the detection prospects of dark matter (DM) annihilation signals in the Galactic Center, focusing on velocity-dependent dynamics within a spike density near the supermassive black hole (Sgr~A$^{\star}$). We investigate three annihilation processes -- $p$-wave, resonance, and forbidden annihilation -- under semi-relativistic velocities, leveraging gamma-ray data from Fermi and DAMPE telescopes. Our analysis integrates a fermionic DM model with an electroweak axion-like particle (ALP) portal, exploring annihilation into two or four photons. Employing a comprehensive six-dimensional integration, we precisely calculate DM-induced gamma-ray fluxes near Sgr~A$^{\star}$, incorporating velocity and positional dependencies in the annihilation cross-section and photon yield spectra. Our findings highlight scenarios of resonance and forbidden annihilation, where the larger ALP-DM-DM coupling constant $C_{a\chi\chi}$ can affect spike density, potentially yielding detectable gamma-ray line spectra within Fermi and DAMPE energy resolution. We set upper limits for $C_{a\chi\chi}$ across these scenarios, offering insights into the detectability and spectral characteristics of DM annihilation signals from the Galactic Center.</description>
