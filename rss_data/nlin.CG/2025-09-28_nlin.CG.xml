      <title>Phase transition from localization to chaos in classical many-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a dynamical phase transition in the information spreading within a classical 2D deterministic interacting many-body system. Specifically, the transition is observed in a recently introduced momentum-conserving parity check cellular automaton (MCPCA) on the square lattice. We characterize the transition using information-theoretic quantities such as the Hamming distance and the classical decorrelator. By introducing conserved local charges of the MCPCA, we show that selecting initial ensembles with specific charge values allows the system to transition from a localized information phase to a chaotic regime with ballistic information spreading. Importantly, our findings indicate that this transition is of second order, highlighting a sharp change in information spreading behavior. Furthermore, we revisit the multifractal behavior of the dynamical structure factor and show that, although present across both phases, it originates from effective local periodicities enforced by symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Fast-Forward Lattice Boltzmann: Learning Kinetic Behaviour with Physics-Informed Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration, effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic systems.</description>

      <title>The Glider Equation for Asymptotic Lenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lenia is a continuous extension of Conway's Game of Life that exhibits rich pattern formations including self-propelling structures called gliders. In this paper, we focus on Asymptotic Lenia, a variant formulated as partial differential equations. By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we analytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the ``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss function, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider configurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find novel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also derive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed, expanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns result in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach effectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to discover through traditional methods. Finally, we establish connections between Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models, highlighting mathematical relationships that bridge these systems and suggesting new directions for analyzing pattern formation in continuous dynamical systems.</description>
