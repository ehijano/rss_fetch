      <title>Cosmological Neutron Stars Produce Diffuse Axion X-Ray Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles can be abundantly produced through scattering processes in the cores of neutron stars (NSs). If they are ultralight ($m_a \lesssim 10^{-4}$ eV), then they can efficiently convert to detectable photons in the external NS magnetospheres, and if they are heavy ($m_a \gtrsim 1$ eV), then they can decay into photons before reaching Earth. In this work, we search for the resulting X-ray signatures from both of these channels summing over the $\textit{cosmological}$ NS population. We compare the predicted axion-induced X-ray signal to the cosmic X-ray background today as measured by a number of instruments such as NuSTAR, HEAO, Swift, and INTEGRAL. We model the axion-induced signal using NS cooling simulations and magnetic field evolution models. We find no evidence for axions and derive strong constraints for both ultralight and heavy axion scenarios, covering new parameter space for the axion-photon and axion-nucleon couplings. Our results rule out the axion-explanation of the Magnificent Seven X-ray excess from nearby isolated NSs.</description>

      <title>Reusable theory representations for colliders: a demonstrator SMEFT foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a demonstrator foundation model for collider-scale explorations of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), constructed from contrastive representations of theoretically simulated neutral-current Drell-Yan cross sections. Using a controlled sampling of the Warsaw-basis dimension-6 Wilson-coefficient space at $O(\Lambda^{-2})$, we generate a corpus of high-resolution differential distributions in $m_{\ell\ell}$ and $p_{T}$, augmented by physics-motivated Monte Carlo replicas with correlated uncertainties. A minimally parameterized encoder network is trained with a supervised contrastive loss to produce a low-dimensional latent manifold on which SMEFT-induced deformations of the Drell-Yan spectrum acquire a well-defined geometric structure. We analyze the resulting embedding and demonstrate that (i) latent directions correlate with characteristic SMEFT shape distortions, including energy-growing four-fermion contributions and electroweak vertex corrections; (ii) clusters in the embedding correspond to families of Wilson-coefficient configurations with similar phenomenological impact; and (iii) the learned representation supports downstream tasks such as classification with uncertainty quantification, anomaly detection, and nearest-neighbor retrieval. While restricted to leading-order SMEFT and simplified uncertainty modeling, this study provides the first step toward a reusable, physics-aligned foundational representation for the theory of New-Physics searches at high-energy colliders. We outline extensions towards a complete global analyses, including multi-process training corpora, higher-order corrections, and multi-objective pretraining.</description>

      <title>Kination and the Inert Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inert doublet model is a two-Higgs-doublet extension of the standard model that provides a minimal and versatile framework for frozen-out dark matter. Assuming standard cosmology, if the dark matter mass ranges between approximately 120 GeV and 500 GeV then it turns out to be underabundant, as gauge interactions render its annihilation too efficient. In this work, we show that this mass window becomes allowed in cosmological scenarios where dark matter freeze-out occurs during a period with a stiff equation of state, $w &gt; 1/3$, such as kination. This predictive setup satisfies all current experimental constraints while remaining within the reach of upcoming detection efforts.</description>

      <title>Weak Charge Form Factor Determination at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the weak charge form factor, $F_W(Q^2)$, of nuclei over a continuous range of momentum transfers, $0\lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 0.1$ GeV$^2$, is essential for mapping out the distribution of neutrons in nuclei. The neutron density distribution has significant implications for a broad range of areas, including studies of nuclear structure, neutron stars, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, our knowledge of $F_W(Q^2)$ comes primarily from fixed target experiments that measure the parity-violating longitudinal electron spin asymmetry in coherent elastic electron-ion scattering. Fixed target experiments, such as CREX and PREX-1,2, have provided high-precision weak charge form factor extractions for the $^{48}{\rm Ca}$ and $^{208}{\rm Pb}$ nuclei, respectively. However, a major limitation of fixed target experiments is that they each provide data only at a single value of $Q^2$. With the proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) on the horizon, we explore its potential to impact the determination of the weak charge form factor. While it cannot compete with the precision of fixed target experiments, it can provide data over a wide and continuous range of $Q^2$ values, and for a wide variety of nuclei. We show that for integrated luminosities of $\mathcal{L} &gt; $ 200/$A$ fb$^{-1}$, where $A$ denotes the nucleus atomic weight, the EIC can be complementary to fixed target experiments, and can significantly impact constraints from CREX and PREX-1,2 by lifting degeneracies in theoretical models of the neutron density distribution.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of general Effective Field Theories: Renormalization of fermionic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization group equations play a central role in effective field theories, both maintaining perturbative control and allowing one to determine the correct low-energy phenomenology. In this work, we complete the one-loop renormalization of the recently developed general effective field theory up to mass dimension six by providing the beta functions for physical fermionic operators. Together with Ref. [1], our results allow one to renormalize any effective theory up to dimension six at one loop using only a group-theoretical calculation.</description>

      <title>HEPTAPOD: Orchestrating High Energy Physics Workflows Towards Autonomous Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many workflows in high-energy-physics (HEP) stand to benefit from recent advances in transformer-based large language models (LLMs). While early applications of LLMs focused on text generation and code completion, modern LLMs now support orchestrated agency: the coordinated execution of complex, multi-step tasks through tool use, structured context, and iterative reasoning. We introduce the HEP Toolkit for Agentic Planning, Orchestration, and Deployment (HEPTAPOD), an orchestration framework designed to bring this emerging paradigm to HEP pipelines. The framework enables LLMs to interface with domain-specific tools, construct and manage simulation workflows, and assist in common utility and data analysis tasks through schema-validated operations and run-card-driven configuration. To demonstrate these capabilities, we consider a representative Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) Monte Carlo validation pipeline that spans model generation, event simulation, and downstream analysis within a unified, reproducible workflow. HEPTAPOD provides a structured and auditable layer between human researchers, LLMs, and computational infrastructure, establishing a foundation for transparent, human-in-the-loop systems.</description>

      <title>Fifty shades of grayness: parameterizations of spectral distortions and applications in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal distribution functions can only be of the Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein types, whereas distorted spectra encompass any possible deviations from these shapes. It is fruitful to devise parameterizations of these distortions with only a few parameters which depend on the physical system considered. A method proposed by Stebbins consists in describing a distorted spectrum as a sum of thermalized spectra with a distribution of temperatures, the moments of which are the parameters of interest. After revisiting and extending this approach by working at the level of the number density distribution instead of the standard spectrum, we build another method which consists in describing the distorted spectrum by a polynomial modulating a reference thermalized spectrum. The distortion parameters are then the coefficients of a decomposition on a suitable orthonormal polynomial basis. We advocate that the latter is computationally easier and allows to describe a wide range of distortions. With this formalism, we efficiently describe the standard distortions of the cosmological backgrounds of neutrinos and photons, and we obtain model-independent constraints on nonstandard distortions of these cosmological relics.</description>

      <title>Energy-Energy Correlators in $e^+e^-$ and Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study energy-energy correlators (EECs) in $e^+e^-$ annihilation and deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering (DIS), focusing on aspects of nonperturbative physics in these observables. We introduce the EEC jet functions and investigate the infrared (IR) behavior of both small-angle EECs and angle-integrated EECs by performing explicit one-loop calculations. The factorization and universality of the EECs in these processes are demonstrated. A matching scheme is proposed to smoothly connect kinematic regions where different scaling behaviors with jet energy are observed. In combination with the next-to-leading order correction, this matching provides a good description of the EEC data and PYTHIA simulations in high-energy $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Predictions for DIS processes for future electron-ion collider kinematics are also presented.</description>

      <title>Deconstructive Composite Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of composite dark matter that disassembles into a cascade while crossing the Earth. This occurs for loosely bound composite dark matter, where the binding energy per constituent is small, such that scattering with Standard Model nuclei typically imparts enough energy to dissociate a constituent from its composite. Trajectories and cascade profiles are found for dissociated constituents that are further diverted by scattering through the Earth. Such scattering cascades are a common feature of TeV-scale weakly-interacting dark matter loosely bound in composites. We identify underground detector signatures of constituent cascades that depend on composite characteristics; these signatures include non-collinear multiple scatters in detectors, parameter-dependent timing separation of multiscatter events, and regions of parameter space where a dark matter cascade would leave a coincident signature in different underground laboratories.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Nuclear Modification Factor from RHIC to LHC energies using Boltzmann Transport equation in conjunction with q-Weibull distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of nuclear modification factor is crucial in advancing our knowledge of the hot and dense nuclear matter created during high energy heavy-ion collision. In this direction, we have developed a theoretical model for the nuclear modification factor using the Boltzmann Transport equation in relaxation time approximation with the q-Weibull distribution as the final state distribution and studied the experimental data of nuclear modification factor of charged hadrons as well as identified particles at various energies ranging from 7.7 GeV measured at RHIC upto the maximum value of 5.44 TeV studied in LHC. We observed a good agreement between the model and the experimental data as can be quantified using the $\chi^2$/NDF values. We have also studied the mass dependence of different fit parameters that appears in the theoretical model and observe a linear mass dependence of some parameters.</description>

      <title>Visible and Invisible Pseudoscalar Meson Decays from Anomaly Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decays of pseudoscalar mesons to real and virtual photons as well as neutrino-antineutrino pairs are considered in the framework of the dispersive method based on Anomaly Sum Rules. The contribution of singlet channel involving the new non-perturbative gluon form factor of virtual photon $B(q^2)$ is systematically taken into account. The detailed analysis of its dependence on photon virtuality $q^2$ relying on the available data for meson transition fomfactors is performed. It is shown that B has quite a nontrivial structure at $q^2 \sim 1 GeV^2$ which may be a signal of the existence of pseudoscalar glueball with a mass about 1.5-2 GeV. The calculation of the decay to $\nu \bar \nu$ pairs leads to the compatibility with the result of Arnellos, Marciano and Parsa of 1982, when pion decay is considered neglecting the mixing effects. The account for these effects results, however, in the enhancement of pion branching ratio by a factor of 3, while that for eta decay is larger by several orders of magnitude. It is stressed, that dependence on the pair invariant mass is entirely defined by QCD and coincides with that of the meson transition form factor. The role of obtained results for the physics at HHaS detector at HIAF is discussed.</description>

      <title>Fatjet Signatures of Quintuplet Fermions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a simplified extension of the standard model featuring a neutral fermion quintuplet and a scalar quadruplet, which together generate neutrino masses through tree and loop level mechanisms. The quintuplet fermions decay into standard model gauge bosons via the scalars, producing unique collider signatures at the LHC characterized by multilepton and multijet final states. The study focuses on the pair production of quintuplet fermions in the 700-1200 GeV mass range, where their decays produce highly boosted W and Z bosons identifiable as fatjets. Emphasis is placed on the production and decay of doubly charged fermions due to their higher cross section. Advanced jet substructure and kinematic techniques are applied to enhance sensitivity by reducing standard model backgrounds. A detailed analysis of signal significance is performed in the two lepton, two fatjet and three lepton, one fatjet channels for different masses of the fermion and the scalars, optimizing selection cuts to maximize signal efficiency over standard model backgrounds. The study found that both channels exhibit excellent performance, with significance exceeding $5\sigma$ under realistic conditions including a 50\% background uncertainty at integrated luminosity up to 3000 fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Fermion reheating with a quartic inflaton potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any viable inflationary model must account for reheating of the universe prior to the onset of primordial nucleosynthesis. In this work, we study the reheating mechanism for an inflaton field with a quartic minimum, assuming that the main particle production channel corresponds to the decay into a pair of spin 1/2 fermions via Yukawa-like interactions. On top of its decays, the self-interaction of the inflaton sources the resonant growth of inflaton inhomogeneities, leading to its eventual fragmentation, unless reheating is completed in a shorter timescale. By means of a combination of non-perturbative (Heisenberg/Bogoliubov) and perturbative (Boltzmann) methods, we find that for Yukawa couplings $y\gtrsim 10^{-8}$ parametric resonance, kinematic blocking, and Pauli suppression effects cannot be ignored to estimate the fermion energy density during reheating. Reheating prior to nucleosynthesis requires couplings above this threshold, and in particular, reheating occurring before fragmentation is only possible for $y\gtrsim 0.2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerator-based neutrino experiments offer a competitive environment to search for long-lived particles with sub-GeV masses. Yet, many theoretical models involving such particles predict very similar phenomenology and nearly identical final-state signatures. In view of this, we study the capabilities of upcoming experiments -- specifically the DUNE near detectors -- to distinguish between different classes of long-lived particles and the mechanisms by which they are produces. We expound how the experiment's excellent energy resolution, combined with the possibility to move the detector off-axis (the DUNE-PRISM concept), work in tandem to improve the discrimination power.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Propagation in Quantum Field Theory at Short and Long Baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a quantum field approach to neutrino oscillations, the neutrino is treated as a propagator, while the external initial and final particle states are described by covariant wave packets. For the asymptotic behavior on short and long macroscopic baselines, the wave packet modified neutrino propagator is expressed through asymptotic series in powers of dimensionless Lorentz and rotation invariant variables. In both regimes, leading-order corrections violate the classical inverse-square law and lead to a decrease in the neutrino-induced event rate. The possibility that the so-called reactor antineutrino anomaly can, at least partially, be explained within this approach is discussed.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Schwinger pair production in time-dependent Sauter pulse electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate entropy of electron-positron pair production in time-dependent Sauter pulse electric field. Both cases of pair longitudinal momentum only and full momentum consideration are examined. We further examine three types of entropy, one is the usual entanglement entropy $S_{\text{E}}$, the other two extensions are thermal distribution entropy $S_{\text{Th}}$, and that with the chemical potential correction, $S_{\text{Th,CP}}$. For short pulse, $S_{\text{E}}$ is higher than $S_{\text{Th}}$ and vice versa for long pulse. The chemical potential causes the single-particle average thermal distribution entropy $\frac{S_{\text{Th,CP}}}{N}$ to exhibit non-monotonic behavior, similar to the single-particle average entanglement entropy $\frac{S_{\text{E}}}{N}$ in the short-pulse range. In the full momentum case, we calculate the thermal distribution entropy $S_{\text{Th, U}}$ via introducing the Unruh temperature as the local effective temperature. We find that both $S_{\text{Th, U}}$ and $S_{\text{E}}$ saturate asymptotically to the constant while the former has a larger asymptotic value. The results presented in this study reveals that the different entropies have some delicate relationships among them.</description>

      <title>Generalized CP from non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a framework in which fields are labeled by basis elements of a fusion algebra with non-invertible fusion rules. In particular, we consider the case where fields are labeled by conjugacy classes of a finite group rather than its irreducible representations. When the fusion rules possess a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry identified with charge conjugation, a CP-invariant system can be consistently defined together with parity transformation. Furthermore, it is found that combining group-based flavor symmetries underlying non-invertible selection rules with CP symmetry naturally leads to a generalized CP transformation. We also demonstrate the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in this framework and discuss its implications for Yukawa textures.</description>

      <title>Compactified 2HDM under the Non-SUSY AdS instability conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how extra-dimensional dynamics influence the Higgs sector phenomenology by compactifying a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) coupled to 4D gravity on a circle $S^{1}$. The resulting effective potential includes tree-level 2HDM interactions, one-loop Coleman-Weinberg corrections from the Kaluza-Klein towers, and a radion contribution inspired by the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. We derive the full 3D effective action and show that, for the observed Higgs mass $m_{h}=125$ GeV, the radion potential admits a stable minimum, near-zero vacuum energy. By imposing the non-supersymmetric AdS instability conjecture as a quantum gravity consistency requirement, we obtain a model independent bound on the heavy Higgs sector, finding that the additional scalar states must satisfy $M_{H}\gtrsim 680$ GeV to avoid an unstable AdS$_{3}$ vacuum. Our results demonstrate how Swampland inspired constraints can yield sharp, phenomenologically testable predictions for extended Higgs sectors.</description>

      <title>CHIC: Caley-Hamilton, Invariants and Constants for Neutrino Oscillation Probabilities and Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Caley-Hamilton theorem to derive analytical solutions for the three-flavor neutrino propagation amplitude in a constant-density medium and their derivatives with respect to the mixing parameters. This approach avoids the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and exploits precomputed matrix invariants to separate the dependence of oscillation probabilities on neutrino energy and propagation baseline. The results are implemented in the CHIC software, which provides simple, fast and efficient computation of oscillation probabilities and their derivatives. Finally, we demonstrate the value of probability gradients for neutrino data analyses and introduce a complementary visualization, the oscillograds, to probe underlying features of neutrino mixing.</description>

      <title>Learning holographic QCD with unflavoured meson spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a neural network framework to predict the five-dimensional background geometry, dilaton potential, and chiral symmetry breaking scalar potential of holographic QCD from unflavored meson mass spectra. The model was trained in a discretized form of the Schr\"odinger-like equation, which resembles a linear moose in ``deconstructed" 5 dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions, in contrast to the AdS/DL with ``emergent" space-time. Using the $\rho$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $f_0$ unflavored mesons and their excitations as training data, the model learns confining effective potentials and computes a dilaton profile that satisfies the null energy condition. The network predicts the IR behavior of dilaton to be in-between linear and quadratic forms. Moreover, the symmetry-breaking bulk potential of the scalar field, $V(X)= k_1 X^3+k_2 X^4$, was computed, and the parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$ predicted to be $\sim - \ 8$ and $\sim 17$ respectively. The deep-learned parameters, metric, and the dilaton profile were then used to predict the pion mass and its spectrum with good accuracy. A Python code, along with the trained models, is provided to facilitate further studies</description>

      <title>Coherence from Randomness: Sub-keV Dark Matter Scattering off Random, Heterogeneous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sub-keV mass range has long posed a challenge for the direct detection of dark matter via elastic scattering. In this Letter, we propose a new mechanism in which dark matter, assumed to be quadratically coupled to SM particles, scatters from random heterogeneous materials with intrinsic density fluctuations, yielding an enhanced coherent response. This effect can substantially increase the total scattering rate and induce measurable accelerations of the target. Using this idea, we derive new constraints from the MICROSCOPE mission that extend into previously unexplored parameter space for sub-keV dark matter, probing cross sections down to $\sim 4\times10^{-38}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Light-Quark Yukawa Flavor Structure via Dihadron Fragmentation at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly probing light-quark Yukawa couplings and their flavor structure remains a major challenge due to their smallness and overwhelming QCD backgrounds. In this Letter, we propose a theoretical framework to access these couplings at lepton colliders through transverse spin dependent azimuthal modulations in dihadron fragmentation. These modulations arise from the interference between Higgs mediated and Standard Model amplitudes in $e^-e^+\to q\bar{q}Z$, producing angular structures that are linearly sensitive to the Yukawa couplings $y_q$, in contrast to conventional observables that scale as $y_q^2$. By combining channels with an identified accompanying single hadron, $h^\prime=\pi^\pm,K^\pm$, and $p/\bar{p}$, this approach cleanly disentangles the up- and down-quark Yukawa contributions, yielding typical limits at the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ level and establishing fragmentation dynamics as a novel and complementary probe of the Higgs flavor structure.</description>

      <title>The Nontrivial Vacuum Structure of an Extended $t\bar{t}$ BEH (Higgs) Bound State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent reformulation of top-quark condensation for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, we introduced an extended internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$. We show how this leads to a manifestly Lorentz invariant formalism, where the absence of ``relative time'' is a gauge invariance of the bilocal field theory. This dictates a novel and nontrivial Lorentz invariant vacuum structure for the BEH boson, the relativistic generalization of a condensed matter state such as a BCS or Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we show that, in the background of the primordial magnetic field, the CME effect can significantly amplify the chiral chemical potential sourced by the CP violation near the bubble walls during the first-order electroweak phase transition. This effect can lift the generated baryon asymmetry by several orders, and make it possible to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe with a CPV in the fermion sector far beyond the limitation of the electron dipole moment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems that feature a scalar field $\phi$ with a quasi scale invariant potential, metastable at $\phi=0$, can remain trapped, during cosmic evolution, in the `wrong' vacuum because the process of bubble nucleation to the true vacuum is inefficient. If $\phi$ carries a conserved charge $Q$, the presence in the system of a non-zero chemical potential for $Q$ offers the possibility of escaping eternal supercooling: when a species decouples from the plasma the balance among the stabilising effect of temperature and the destabilising effect of chemical potential can change in favour of the latter, so that $\phi$ condenses and triggers the transition to the stable phase.</description>

      <title>Condensation of slow $\gamma$-quanta in strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implications of the root singularity of the vacuum polarization tensor near the first pair creation threshold on blackbody radiation are investigated for magnetic fields above the characteristic scale of quantum electrodynamics. We show that the vacuum birefringence in such a strong background leads to an anisotropic behavior of the Planck radiation law. The thermal spectrum is characterized by a resonance that competes with the Wien maximum, causing a crossover in the low $\gamma$-spectrum of the heat radiation. A light state resembling a many-body condensate with slow motion is linked to the high-temperature phase. This novel state of radiation may coexist with nuclear or quark matter in a neutron star's core, increasing its compactness and influencing its stability.</description>

      <title>Probing Excited $q\bar{q}$ Mesons via QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the masses of light excited $q\bar{q}$ mesons using QCD sum rules at next-to-leading order (NLO). To probe excited states, we construct several interpolating currents involving covariant derivatives. The calculation is carried out up to dimension-8 condensates, including NLO perturbative and $m\langle\bar{q}q\rangle$ corrections. Employing Gaussian sum rules, we obtain several $J^P=2^\pm$ nonets with masses agreeing well with experiments. Several $J=0,1$ states compatible with experiments are also obtained using both Gaussian and Laplace sum rules. In particular, the $J^P=2^+$ current couples to two distinct $J^P=2^+$ resonances. This work demonstrates the efficacy of operators with covariant derivatives for studying excited hadrons.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Herwig 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the physics foundations and recent developments of Herwig 7, the modern successor of the original HERWIG and Herwig++ series. Herwig 7 provides a flexible and systematically improvable framework for the simulation of high-energy lepton and hadron collisions, with particular emphasis on QCD and EW effects. Hard scattering processes are generated within the automated Matchbox framework, which integrates external amplitude providers, supports tree-level, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and loop-induced matrix elements, and implements subtraction schemes, multi-channel phase-space sampling, dynamic scale choices and both POWHEG- and MC@NLO-type matching algorithms. Consistent multijet merging at LO and NLO is provided, enabling precise predictions across a wide range of SM processes. Parton radiation is simulated using two complementary showers: an angular-ordered shower incorporating QCD coherence and the heavy-quark dead-cone effect, and a dipole shower optimised for NLO matching and multijet merging. Higher-order corrections are included through matrix-element corrections and dedicated reweighting techniques, while QED and EW radiation are treated using a YFS formalism and EW showering algorithms. The modelling of non-perturbative physics employs an advanced cluster hadronization framework with improved cluster formation, fission and decay, as well as colour reconnection models, heavy-quark effects and interfaces to alternative hadronization schemes. An extended eikonal multiple-partonic-scattering model, incorporating semi-hard and soft components together with diffractive interactions, enables realistic descriptions of minimum-bias and underlying-event data. Herwig 7 thus represents a versatile event generator, providing a coherent, modular and extensible platform for Standard Model and beyond-the-Standard-Model collider phenomenology at current and future facilities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline how to calculate the scalar damping term during a cosmological phase transition from kinetic theory. We determine the scalar damping rate from top quarks and weak gauge bosons in a Standard Model-like theory. We find that the convergence of the bosonic contributions hinges on how the soft modes are treated. We discuss the validity of the phenomenological friction term employed in hydrodynamical simulations. We find that for a Standard Model particle content, this approximation is (marginally) justified.
  We also test the hypothesis that the pressure from a runaway wall acts as an upper bound on the pressure from the local friction term. We find that next-to-leading order contributions in terms of velocity and mass are negative and that in the regime of validity, the local damping term indeed cannot surpass the pressure from runaway bubbles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of heavy neutral lepton extensions of the Standard Model, we consider the rare di-Higgs production mode $\ell^+\ell^-\to hh$ at future high-energy lepton colliders. As a concrete example, we study the impact of a low-scale Inverse Seesaw realisation on the prospects for di-Higgs production. Our results show that the presence of TeV-scale heavy neutral leptons can enhance the cross-section by up to factor 60. We further comment on the interplay with electroweak precision observables, showing that bounds on the di-Higgs production cross-section at future high-energy lepton colliders could serve as complementary probes of low-scale seesaw scenarios.</description>

      <title>On Non-Minimal Couplings to Gravity and Axion Isocurvature Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For axions present during inflation, it has been shown that a non-minimal coupling $\xi_\sigma$ of the inflaton to gravity worsens isocurvature bounds, while a non-minimal coupling $\xi_\rho$ of the radial Peccei-Quinn field can alleviate them. We analyze the simultaneous presence of both couplings and determine when one effect dominates the other, in both the metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. The two tendencies interpolate smoothly, but introducing a non-minimal inflaton coupling reduces the viable interval of $\xi_\rho$ in which isocurvature bounds can be alleviated while avoiding backreaction on the inflationary dynamics. We illustrate our findings in Palatini Higgs inflation and Starobinsky inflation.</description>

Abstract: The search for supersymmetric models remains one of the main items on the BSM search program at the LHC, with EW SUSY partners still allowed with masses as low as a few hundred GeV. Over the last years, searches for the "golden channel", $pp \to \tilde{\chi}^0_2 \tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1 \to \tilde{\chi}^0_1 Z^{(*)} \tilde{\chi}^0_1 W^{\pm (*)}$ show consistent excesses between ATLAS and CMS in the 2~soft-lepton and 3~soft-lepton plus missing-$E_T$ searches, assuming $m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_2} \approx m_{\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1} \gtrsim 200$ GeV and $\Delta m_{21} := m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_2} - m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_1} \approx 20$ GeV. We interpret these excesses in the framework of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We assume a singlino dominated lightest neutralino as a Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The second and third lightest neutralinos are higgsino like, with the higgsino mixing parameter $\mu$ being smaller than the soft SUSY-breaking bino and wino masses, $M_1$ and $M_2$. We furthermore assume the approximate GUT relations $M_1 \sim M_2/2 \sim M_3/6$, with the implication for our scenario of a gluino mass $m_{\tilde{g}} \sim M_3 \gtrsim 3$ TeV. Scalar masses are assumed to heavy and do not play a role in our analysis. We find that this scenario is in agreement with all relevant experimental constraints, comprising the LHC searches for SUSY particles and additional Higgs bosons, the LHC Higgs-boson rate measurements, the DM direct detection limits and the upper limit on the DM relic density. We demonstrate that this scenario gives an excellent description of the observed excesses in the search for 2~and 3~soft-leptons plus \ETmiss, with $m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_2} \sim m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_3} \sim m_{\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1}$ and $\Delta m_{21} \sim 20$ GeV. This constitutes the first explanation of the soft-lepton excesses in a model with GUT relations among the soft SUSY-breaking parameters.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading Order corrections to the Next-to-Eikonal DIS structure functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to next-to-eikonal (NEik) quark background contributions to DIS structure functions. Among NEik corrections, $t$-channel quark exchanges provide the lowest order contributions in $\alpha_s$, and can be represented as insertions of the quark background field of the target. At NLO, we compute NEik corrections induced by both quark and gluon background fields, and suppressed by an explicit factor of $\alpha_s$. We show that the NLO corrections to the NEik longitudinal structure function are finite, while those to the NEik transverse structure function exhibit rapidity and UV divergences. These divergences are analyzed, and the finite contributions are extracted.</description>

      <title>Impact of Supercooling on Direct Searches for Dark Matter and Gravitational Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interesting feature of a cosmological phase transition can be a stage of exponential expansion (supercooling). The modified expansion history and the entropy injection at reheating, can affect the final energy fraction of dark matter. In this paper, we revisit the calculation of the freeze-out and freeze-in dynamics, showing additional effects on top of the standard dilution factor if the dark matter production is completed during the supercooling stage. We show for the first time how these effects can be particularly interesting for direct detection, as the parameter space for WIMP-like candidates shifts from excluded to allowed regions, and freeze-in candidates get closer to experimental reach. A phenomenological motivation to consider supercooling is the associated gravitational wave background. The implications of a finite-duration reheating stage, when the equation of state is close to matter-domination, are a peculiar low-frequency spectrum, and its shift to lower frequencies. These effects are a complementary test of the dynamics that we study for dark matter production, and remarkably can link direct detection of dark matter and gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Delayed Scaling of Multi-Type Cosmic F- and D-strings in VOS Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model to the case of one cosmic F-string and two D-strings as color flux tubes in pure Spin($4N$) gauge theory. We analytically calculate the scaling string density as a function of the reconnection probabilities, and confirm our results with numerical calculations. We also determine the timescale at which the string density reaches the scaling regime, and find that for certain values of the reconnection probability, the scaling time can become extremely large, by many orders of magnitude. This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the program package ggxy, which in its first version can be used to calculate partonic and hadronic cross sections to Higgs boson pair production at NLO QCD and it offers a direct interface to POWHEG-BOX. The 2-loop virtual amplitudes are implemented using analytical approximations in different kinematic regions, while all other parts of the calculation are exact. This implementation allows to freely modify all input parameter, such as the three Higgs coupling, the masses of the top quark and the Higgs boson, and the top-quark mass renormalization scheme.</description>

      <title>Multiple Axions in Laboratory Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles generically appear in extensions of the Standard Model. While many searches assume only a single axion species, there may exist a whole spectrum of multiple such fields. We develop general formulas for axion-photon oscillations in the presence of multiple axions and analyze the implications for experimental searches, including light-shining-through-a-wall experiments, helioscopes and haloscopes. We demonstrate that axion multiplicity can qualitatively alter observational signatures, particularly through coherence and interference effects. Multiple axions can not only enhance signals compared to single axion scenarios, but also suppress them. We show that variations of experimental parameters and searches allow identifying contributions of multiple axions and obtaining information about their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-point energy correlator (OPEC) at both the back-to-back and collinear limits in electron-proton and electron-nucleus collisions. We provide the factorization formalism for the two types of OPEC and present phenomenological predictions in the kinematic region relevant for the future Electron-Ion Collider. Focusing on cold nuclear matter effects in electron-nucleus scattering, we demonstrate that the OPEC serves as a powerful probe of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) physics and in characterizing the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening in cold nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Gravity-assisted neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity is generally expected to violate global symmetries, including lepton number. However, neutrino masses from the Planck-suppressed Weinberg operator are typically too small to account for oscillation data. We propose a new model-building approach to low-scale neutrino mass generation, in which an intermediate spontaneous symmetry-breaking scale generates masses and mixings in the heavy neutral lepton (HNL) sector, while leaving an unbroken residual symmetry $G_{\mathrm{res}}$ that forbids light-neutrino masses. The observed light-neutrino masses then arise because gravity breaks $G_{\mathrm{res}}$ via Planck-suppressed operators, inducing the small lepton-number violation required in low-scale seesaw constructions. The HNLs form pseudo-Dirac pairs, with masses potentially within reach of future colliders and complementary tests in precision searches such as charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV). As an illustration, we present a representative realisation of this class of models and show that, for $\mathcal{O}(1)$ operator coefficients, it predicts a region in the ($M_R$, $\Theta^2$)-plane that can be testable via displaced-vertex searches at the High-Luminosity (HL) LHC and the FCC-ee.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how to solve the Dirac equation, $(i\gamma^\mu[\partial_\mu+ieA_\mu(t,{\bf x})]-m)\psi=0$, on a GPU. This is orders of magnitude faster than solving it on CPU and allows us to consider background fields, $A_\mu(t,{\bf x})$, that depend on $2+1$ or even $3+1$ coordinates. Our approach is conveniently implemented using the computational library JAX. We show how to obtain the probabilities of Schwinger and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production from these solutions using a scattered-wave-function approach and compare the results with the worldline-instanton approximations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dimension of a General Effective Gauge Theory II: Fermionic Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete set of one-loop anomalous dimensions for general Effective Field Theories (EFTs) is derived using on-shell methods. Combined with previous findings for the bosonic sector, the obtained results conclude the computation of the complete set of leading order Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) in arbitrary gauge EFTs containing scalar and fermion fields. Renormalization effects are consistently taken into account at the order $1/\Lambda^2$ in the new physics scale $\Lambda$ for all renormalizable and non-renormalizable couplings. The obtained template RGEs include operator mixing across different dimensions and are valid for arbitrary gauge groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare kaon decays provide sensitive tests of new physics. In this work, we focus on scalar and pseudoscalar operators, analysing the $K\to \pi \ell^+\ell^-$ and $K\to \ell^+\ell^-$ decays. We highlight the complementary role of different modes: $K^+\to\pi^+\ell^+\ell^-$, in particular the forward-backward asymmetry in the muon channel as a clean probe of scalar effects, the stringent constraints from $K_L\to \mu^+\mu^-$, and the discovery potential of future measurements of $K_S\to \mu^+\mu^-$ and $K_L\to \pi^0 \ell^+\ell^-$. The interplay between charged and neutral modes underscores the complementarity of NA62, the LHCb upgrade, and KOTO-II.</description>

      <title>Charged black holes in the 1/N expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study some implications of $SU(N)\times U(1)$ theories coupled to gravity in the large-$N$ limit. We find that in theories with quarks transforming as $q\sim (\mathbf{N},1)$, black holes (BH) with charge larger than a critical value approach extremality $(M_{\rm BH}=\sqrt{2} M_{\rm Pl} Q_{\rm BH})$ as they evaporate. This occurs because BHs in this theory can only lose charge by emitting baryons, a process suppressed by a combinatoric factor $e^{-N\log N}$. Once extremality is reached the BH evolution halts for exponentially long times, $\tau_{\rm BH}\gtrsim e^{N\log N}$, without being protected by any symmetry. At times $t\gg\tau_{\rm BH}$ the BH forms a cloud of deconfined quarks around it, a \textit{quark corona}. The quarks are connected to the horizon by strings extending throughout distances that can be much larger than the inverse of the confinement scale, $\Lambda_N^{-1}$. Strikingly, due to energy conservation, these long strings cannot break even for light quarks. These effects can be further enhanced in clockwork-like theories based on Yang-Mills sectors of the type, $SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2)\times ...\times U(1)$. As an application to phenomenology, we give examples where BHs as light as one gram survive until today without evaporating, opening up regions of parameter space for primordial BH dark matter previously excluded by Hawking evaporation. This result relies only on large-$N$ combinatorics and is independent of the radiation mechanism from the BH, particle masses, and confinement scale. The theories we discuss pass non-trivial tests imposed by Swampland conjectures, including completeness of the spectrum as well as the weak gravity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Dark Acoustic Oscillations as an Early-Universe Explanation of the DESI Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESI DR2 data have been widely interpreted as evidence for late-time evolving dark energy (DE) with an apparent phantom crossing. Here we investigate an alternative explanation, based on early-Universe physics. If dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) are close in scale to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), they can bias the extraction of the BAO scale from the peak in the galaxy correlation function. This leads to an apparent shift in the inferred distance if the superposition of BAO and DAO features is misinterpreted as being due to BAO only. Taking this shift into account, we find that a DAO with percent-level amplitude can reconcile DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 as well as Pantheon+ supernovae data, with fit improvement at a similar level as compared to evolving DE. Notably, a DAO feature with the required properties has been predicted in a previously proposed scenario that resolves the Hubble tension via a pre-recombination decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation (DRMD). The presence of a DAO feature close to the BAO peak can be scrutinized with future full-shape galaxy clustering data from DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Modeling the frequency-domain ringdown amplitude of comparable-mass mergers with greybody factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that, in a binary coalescence, the greybody factor of the remnant black hole modulates the post-merger ringdown signal. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple four-parameter model based on the greybody factor accurately reproduces the frequency-domain amplitude of a large set of comparable-mass, aligned-spin numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, achieving mismatches of order ${\cal O}(10^{-5})$ and improving existing models by roughly two orders of magnitude. We also identify the optimal initial frequency for applying the model in the frequency domain and provide analytical fits of the model parameters in terms of the progenitor masses and aligned spins. Our results pave the way for new consistency tests of the ringdown phase, complementary to traditional black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the shockwave metric in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell effective field theory (EFT) by performing an ultra-relativistic boost of the charged black hole solution accompanied by a rescaling of its mass and charge, including leading order EFT corrections. In contrast to the neutral (Schwarzschild) case, where higher derivative operators leave the shockwave geometry unchanged, we show that electrically charged shockwaves receive nontrivial EFT corrections. We then compute the time delay experienced by a probe photon traversing the resulting charged shockwave. We find that two EFT contributions, the correction to the shockwave geometry and the backreaction induced by the probe photon, are both essential for obtaining a physical time delay that is invariant under field redefinitions of the metric.</description>

      <title>Probing neutron star interiors and the properties of cold ultra-dense matter with the SKAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter inside neutron stars is compressed to densities several times greater than nuclear saturation density, while maintaining low temperatures and large asymmetries between neutrons and protons. Neutron stars, therefore, provide a unique laboratory for testing physics in environments that cannot be recreated on Earth. To uncover the highly uncertain nature of cold, ultra-dense matter, discovering and monitoring pulsars is essential, and the SKA will play a crucial role in this endeavour. In this paper, we will present the current state-of-the-art in dense matter physics and dense matter superfluidity, and discuss recent advances in measuring global neutron star properties (masses, moments of inertia, and maximum rotation frequencies) as well as non-global observables (pulsar glitches and free precession). We will specifically highlight how radio observations of isolated neutron stars and those in binaries -- such as those performed with the SKA in the near future -- inform our understanding of ultra-dense physics and address in detail how SKAO's telescopes unprecedented sensitivity, large-scale survey and sub-arraying capabilities will enable novel dense matter constraints. We will also address the potential impact of dark matter and modified gravity models on these constraints and emphasise the role of synergies between the SKA and other facilities, specifically X-ray telescopes and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics from the S-matrix reloaded: emergent thermal mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of Dashen, Ma and Bernstein (DMB) expresses the thermal partition function of a system in terms of the S-matrix operator, roughly $Z(\beta) \propto \int dE\, e^{-\beta E}\,\text{Tr}\,\ln S(E),$ where $S$ denotes the full scattering operator on the asymptotic Fock space -- i.e. including all multi-particle sectors -- defined via the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Recently we have employed this formalism to compute the free energy of flux tubes (essentially a two-dimensional theory of derivatively coupled scalars) and the two-loop $O(\alpha_s)$ QCD thermal free energy. Moving to higher orders, it is well known that at $O(\alpha_s^2)$ in QCD, or e.g. at $O(\lambda^2)$ in $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, the free energy develops IR divergences. These IR divergences are resolved by the screening Debye mass. However, the DMB formalism expresses the free energy in terms of a trace of the S-matrix operator in the vacuum. How, then, does the Debye mass arise in this framework? In this work we address this question, thereby paving the way for higher-order applications of the DMB formalism in relativistic QFT.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with non-linear barotropic Israel-Stewart fluid with causal relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an extended expression for the relaxation time of a barotropic Israel-Stewart (IS) fluid using the non-linear causality constraint, and propose a new formulation for modeling causal viscous dissipation in barotropic fluids. With this generalized relaxation time, the non-linear IS equation simplifies to a first-order non-linear expression connecting bulk viscous pressure and energy density, which remains valid in any homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. In the case of spatially flat Friedmann universe, adopting this extended relation in the generalized non-linear IS theory, provides new class of analytical solutions in both, the linear, and the non-linear regimes. We also find that, the resulting effective equation of state in the linear regime naturally reproduces the generalized polytropic form which is often introduced phenomenologically in literature. Resulting dynamical implications are investigated and the constraints necessary for ensuring an acceptable evolutionary behavior for the fluid are determined. A detailed dynamical system analysis of the coupled Einstein-Israel-Stewart (EIS) system is also performed. Finally, we solve the coupled EIS equations numerically, and show that the model can support a transient Hubble slow-roll expansion phase with a smooth exit to a radiation-dominated universe, which is challenging to obtain in standard inflationary models.</description>

      <title>A Universal Geometric Framework for Black Hole Phase Transitions: From Multivaluedness to Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed synchronized multivalued behavior in thermodynamic, dynamical, and geometric quantities during the black hole first-order phase transition, which enables a diagnosis from different perspectives, yet its fundamental origin has remained poorly understood. By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Explicit finite-time illustration of improper unitary evolution for the Klein--Gordon field in de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that quantum field theories in curved spacetime suffer from a number of pathologies, including the inability to relate states on different spatial slices by proper unitary time-evolution operators. In this article, we illustrate this issue by describing the canonical quantisation of a free scalar field in de Sitter space and explicitly demonstrating that the vacuum at a given time slice is unitarily inequivalent to that at any other time. In particular, we find that, if both background and Hamiltonian dynamics are taken into account, this inequivalence holds even for infinitesimally small time steps and not only in the asymptotic time limits.</description>

      <title>A finite temperature framework for quark matter with color-superconducting phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current observations of neutron stars and measurements of gravitational waves only provide constraints on the zero temperature ($T=0$) equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. The detection of the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from a binary neutron star merger would additionally provide access to finite-temperature properties of the EoS which contain more information about the composition and the interactions of dense matter than the cold EoS alone. In particular deconfined quark matter may be probed by its characteristic finite temperature effects. This is especially the case for color-superconducting phases, in which the quasiparticle contribution to the thermal pressure is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures. Here we develop a new finite $T$ framework to model the thermal EoS for dense quark matter based on the cold quark matter EoS which is useful for numerical relativity simulations. We test the validity of the framework against a three-flavor NJL mean-field calculation, both with and without diquark pairing. We find that even for the complicated phase diagram of the NJL model including multiple different phases the framework is accurate to the few percent level for temperatures up to $T\sim 50\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and neutrinos along the cosmic expansion history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological measurements are hinting that dark energy may evolve, with its equation of state, $w_\mathrm{DE}$, even showing oscillatory patterns. In this work, we employ a model-independent approach to jointly reconstruct $w_\mathrm{DE}$ and the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu$, adopting the PCHIP method with seven fixed nodes in which we allow the two parameters to vary. We employ CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Supernovae Ia data to constrain the values of $w_\mathrm{DE}$ and $\sum m_\nu$ at each node. We conduct three different analyses in which we reconstruct $w_\mathrm{DE}$: one with fixed $\sum m_\nu=0.06~\mathrm{eV}$; one in which we allow $\sum m_\nu$ to vary, and one in which we also reconstruct $\sum m_\nu$ using the PCHIP method. We find the dark energy equation of state to be consistent with the cosmological constant scenario, except when including DESI data and allowing for phantom crossing, where we find a $95\%$ CL deviation from $w_\mathrm{DE}=-1$ around $z\sim1.2$. For neutrino masses, we obtain looser constraints when focusing on phantom dark energy, that show further early and late relaxation when reconstructing the mass via the PCHIP method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for inflationary model building in the framework of metric-affine gravity. Such a mechanism involves an inflaton non-minimally coupled with the Holst invariant. If the non-minimal coupling function has a zero point and it is very steep at that same point, then the canonically normalized inflaton potential always features an exponential plateau, regardless of the shape of the original inflaton potential. The inflationary predictions in such a region are equivalent to the ones of Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) can be employed to analyze lattice data in gauge theories that lie in close proximity of the lower edge of the conformal window. Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.</description>

      <title>Discovering gravitational waveform distortions from lensing: a deep dive into GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are unique messengers as they travel through the Universe without alteration except for gravitational lensing. Their long wavelengths make them susceptible to diffraction by cosmic structures, providing an unprecedented opportunity to map dark matter substructures. Identifying lensed events requires the analysis of thousands to millions of simulated events to reach high statistical significances. This is computationally prohibitive with standard GW parameter estimation methods. We build on top of state-of-the-art neural posterior algorithms to accelerate the lensed inference from CPU days to minutes with DINGO-lensing. We showcase its capabilities by reanalyzing GW231123, the most promising lensed candidate so far, and find that its statistical significance cannot exceed 4$\sigma$. We observe that 8% of GW231123-like nonlensed simulations favor lensing, which could be explained by the self-similarity of short-duration signals. Still, 58% of GW231123-like lensed simulations have larger support for lensing, showing that higher detection statistics are possible. Although GW231123 exposes the challenges of claiming the first GW lensing detection, our deep-learning methods have demonstrated to be powerful enough to enable the upcoming discovery of lensed GWs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Scalar NSI on Spatial and Temporal Correlations in Neutrino Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments are gradually approaching an era of precision, where subleading effects can also be tested. One such subleading effect is Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), which can play a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. Various works have typically discussed vector NSI in the context of quantum correlations. Recently, there have been improvements in the bounds on scalar NSI as well. In light of these developments, we aim to examine the impact of scalar NSI on quantum correlation measures. To analyze this impact, we are considering the strongest measure of quantum correlation, i.e., non-locality. Our study will encompass both spatial and temporal non-locality measures.</description>

Abstract: A novel point cloud diffusion model for relativistic heavy-ion collisions, capable of ultra-fast generation of complete, event-by-event collision output, is introduced. When trained on UrQMD cascade simulations, the model generates realistic collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species, as a list of particle momentum vectors along with their particle ID. From solving inverse problems to accelerating model calculations or detector simulations, the model can be a promising general purpose tool for heavy-ion collisions beneficial to both theoretical studies and experimental applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative framework that uses probabilistic diffusion models for ultra fast, event-by-event simulations of heavy-ion collision output. This new framework is trained on UrQMD cascade data to generate a full collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species. The output is represented as a point cloud, where each point is defined by a particle's momentum vector and its corresponding species information (ID). Our architecture integrates a normalizing flow-based condition generator that encodes global event features into a latent vector, and a diffusion model that synthesizes a point cloud of particles based on this condition. A detailed description of the model and an in-depth analysis of its performance is provided. The conditional point cloud diffusion model learns to generate realistic output particles of collision events which successfully reproduce the UrQMD distributions for multiplicity, momentum and rapidity of each hadron type. The flexible point cloud representation of the event output preserves full event-level granularity, enabling direct application to inverse problems and parameter estimation tasks while also making it easily adaptable for accelerating any event-by-event model calculation or detector simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted three-dimensional lattice simulations to study the density perturbation and gravitational waves (GWs) during first-order phase transition (FOPT). We find that for phase transition strength $\alpha &gt; 1$, the forward motion of bubble walls becomes the primary source, whereas for $\alpha &lt; 1$, the dominant contribution to the density perturbation comes from the delay of vacuum decay. Additionally, the power spectrum of density perturbations generated by the phase transition exhibits a slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-1.5}$ at large wavenumbers. Furthermore, we calculated the GW power spectra, which exhibit the slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-2}$ at large wavenumbers. Our numerical simulations confirm that slow PTs can produce PBHs and provide predictions for the GW power spectrum, offering theoretical support for GW detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the single-spin asymmetry for the single-inclusive production of hadrons and jets in collisions of transversely polarized nucleons and unpolarized leptons, $\ell N^\uparrow \to (h\,\mathrm{or\,jet})X$. We compute the spin-dependent cross section within collinear twist-3 factorization in perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. In this approach, multiparton correlations generate a non-vanishing effect. For the present paper, we focus on correlations in the nucleon initial-state rather than in the fragmentation process. We explicitly verify that collinear twist-3 factorization is valid at the one-loop level. Our analytical results show that at NLO the relevant multiparton correlation functions in the nucleon are probed on their full support in momentum fractions. Our numerical analysis for collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider indicates that the NLO corrections can be large and are sensitive to the functional form of the twist-3 correlation functions.</description>

While the inflationary energy scale of the metric variant is too high to accommodate isocurvature bounds, it was argued that Palatini Higgs inflation could evade these constraints. We show, however, that an energy-dependent decay constant enhances isocurvature perturbations, implying that axions can at most constitute a tiny fraction $&lt; 10^{-5}$ of dark matter. This conclusion can be avoided in Einstein-Cartan gravity by an additional coupling of the axion to torsion, albeit for a very specific choice of parameters. Analogous constraints as well as the possibility to alleviate them are relevant for all inflationary models with a non-minimal coupling to gravity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>

Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a transverse entangling two-sphere of radius $R_{EE}$; at this radius the QCD vacuum -- partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions -- reaches its maximal entanglement entropy. Lattice-QCD determinations of the scalar (trace) gravitational form factors fix both $R_{EE}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{EE})$, yielding a parameter-free slope $c_h = 8\pi^2 R_{EE}^2\,\rho_h(R_{EE})$ and a mechanical entropy $S_{EE}(y)=c_h\,y$ that grows linearly with rapidity $y$. The entropy gradient $\partial_R S_{EE}$ changes sign at $R_{EE}$: it pushes colored degrees of freedom outward for $r&lt;R_{EE}$ and pulls them inward for $r&gt;R_{EE}$, thereby localizing them on the codimension-2 entangling two-sphere $\Sigma_\perp = S^2_{R_{EE}}$ (which, in the infinite-momentum frame, projects onto the transverse plane), the 'information wall'. This provides a high-energy (large-$y$) entropic confinement diagnostic that complements -- rather than replaces -- Wilson's area-law criterion, which probes long-distance dynamics near the rest frame ($y\to 0$). Imposing unitarity on an entropic ansatz for the amplitude yields $\sigma(s)\propto y^{\delta}$. World data favor $\delta=2$ for elastic $pp\,(p\bar p)$ scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, whereas $\phi$ photoproduction favors a softer $\delta=0.387$. All extracted cross sections remain well below the Froissart--Martin bound. These results provide a confinement criterion quantified directly from non-perturbative QCD inputs, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of rho condensate at a finite isospin chemical potential in the quark meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of an isospin chemical potential ($\mu_{I}$) within the quark-meson model, which approximates quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by modeling low energy phenomena such as chiral symmetry breaking and phase structure under varying conditions of temperature and chemical potential. Using the functional renormalization group (FRG) flow equations, we calculate the phase diagram in the chiral limit within the two-flavor quark-meson model in a finite $\mu_{I}$ with $\rho$ vector meson interactions. Fluctuation effects significantly decrease the critical chemical potential from the mean-field (MF) value $\mu_{I, MF} &gt; m_\rho$ to lower value, at which point the $\rho$ vector meson condensates alongside the chiral condensate once the isospin chemical potential exceeds the critical value $\mu_{I}^{\text{crit}}$. This $\rho$ condensation is investigated numerically for different meson coupling strengths. The $\rho$ meson dominated region is delineated from other phases by a second-order phase transition at lower $\mu_{I}$ and a first-order transition at slightly higher $\mu_{I}$.</description>

      <title>R-parity violation and 8 TeV four-jet events at the LHC: a falsification opportunity for Wagner's Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has observed two four-jet events with a total invariant mass of about 8 TeV; within each event, the jets can be paired into two dijets with invariant masses of 2 TeV each. These are extremely rare events due to the large invariant mass, which implies a very small QCD background, as well as to the di-jet structure, which makes it prone to an interpretation in terms of a heavy resonance decaying into two lighter ones. We investigate the possible interpretation of these events in terms of supersymmetry with a single baryon-number and R-Parity violating term. Such an interpretation would be in accordance with Wagner's rule, which asserts that any collider anomaly may be explained by low-energy Supersymmetry when R-Parity-violating couplings are allowed. In this particular scenario, the lighter resonances are identified with the right-handed squarks of the first generation, while the heavy one is interpreted in terms of a down-squark of the second or third generation. We discuss the constraints that shape this interpretation and outline a well-defined scenario for its realization. The resulting predictions can be scrutinized with forthcoming LHC data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques are used to predict theoretical constraints such as unitarity and boundedness from below in extensions of the Standard Model. This approach has proven effective for models incorporating additional SU(2) scalar multiplets, in particular the quadruplet and sixplet cases. High predictive performance is achieved through the use of suitable neural network architectures and well-prepared training datasets. Moreover, machine learning provides a substantial computational advantage, enabling significantly faster evaluations compared to scalar potential minimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonthermal attractors govern the emergent self-similar dynamics of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, from ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions to cold-atom experiments. Within the framework of adiabatic hydrodynamization, the approach to a nonthermal attractor is described by the decay of excited states of an effective Hamiltonian. Using an exactly solvable kinetic theory -- the longitudinally expanding, overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by small-angle elastic scattering -- we establish a direct correspondence between the eigenmodes of adiabatic hydrodynamization and the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor. This equivalence suggests a general framework for identifying universal dynamical structures in nonequilibrium systems. As a byproduct, we derive analytic prescaling solutions for strongly longitudinally expanding systems.</description>

      <title>Discovery Prospects for a Leptophilic Gauge Boson $Z_\ell$ at CEPC and ILC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery prospects of a leptophilic gauge boson Z_l at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, focusing on a comparative study of the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). This state can arise from an additional U(1)'_l gauge symmetry under which quarks are neutral and all leptons have a universal charge, motivated by neutrino oscillations and physics beyond the Standard Model. As a clean benchmark we study $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-$ including realistic initial state radiation (ISR) and beamstrahlung. We find that CEPC at sqrt(s)=240 GeV can probe couplings down to $g_l \sim 10^{-3}$ for $Z_l$ masses up to about 220 GeV, while the ILC extends the sensitivity to heavier states in the multi-hundred GeV range through its higher sqrt(s) stages. These results highlight the complementarity of circular and linear colliders in testing purely leptophilic interactions. Published in Chinese Physics C 50 (2026) 033104.

      <title>Resummed Distribution Functions: Making Perturbation Theory Positive and Normalized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed-order perturbative calculations for differential cross sections can suffer from non-physical artifacts: they can be non-positive, non-normalizable, and non-finite, none of which occur in experimental measurements. We propose a framework, the Resummed Distribution Function (RDF), that, given a perturbative calculation for an observable to some finite order in $\alpha_s$, will ``resum'' the expression in a way that is guaranteed to match the original expression order-by-order and be positive, normalized, and finite. Moreover, our ansatz parameterizes all possible finite, positive, and normalized completions consistent with the original fixed-order expression, which can include N$^n$LL resummed expressions. The RDF also enables a more direct notion of perturbative uncertainties, as we can directly vary higher-order parameters and treat them as nuisance parameters. We demonstrate the power of the RDF ansatz by matching to thrust to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ and extracting $\alpha_s$ with perturbative uncertainties by fitting the RDF to ALEPH data.</description>

      <title>JUNO's Impact on the Neutrino Mass Ordering from Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to probe new physics by searching for Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV). Using the 59.1-day dataset recently released by this experiment, we analyze neutrino oscillations to place new constraints on the LIV parameters in the CPT-even ($c_{ee} - c_{e\mu}$, $c_{ee} - c_{e\tau}$) and CPT-odd ($a_{ee} - a_{e\mu}$, $a_{ee} - a_{e\tau}$) sectors. Our analysis reveals a significant shift in the oscillation parameter space of $\sin^2\theta_{12}-\Delta m^2_{21}$ when LIV is included; with the best-fit point for normal ordering moving to the higher values of the solar angle $\theta_{12}$, a strong preference emerges for inverted mass ordering. In particular, the $c_{ee} - c_{e\tau}$ and $a_{ee} - a_{e\tau}$ sectors show the most pronounced effects. We report the most stringent bounds from JUNO to date on these LIV parameters, showcasing the detector's unique sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Precise prediction of the decay rate for $\eta_b\to \gamma \gamma$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the decay rate for $\eta_b \to \gamma \gamma$ in lattice QCD for the first time, providing a precise prediction for the Belle II experiment. Our calculation includes $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea, using gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration, at three values of the lattice spacing from $0.06\;\mathrm{fm}$ to $0.03\;\mathrm{fm}$. All quarks are treated in the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism, which enables us to reach the $b$ quark mass for our valence quarks on these fine lattices. We calculate quark-line connected correlation functions only. By working at additional heavy quark masses between those of $c$ and $b$ we map out the behaviour of the ratio $f_{\eta_h}/(M_{\eta_h}^2F_{\eta_h}(0,0))$, where $f$ is the decay constant, $M$, the mass and $F(0,0)$, the form factor for decay to two on-shell photons for the pseudoscalar heavyonium meson, $\eta_h$. This ratio takes the approximate value 0.5 in leading-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) but we are able to give a much more accurate analysis than this. Focussing on the $b$ quark mass, we find a ratio of $0.467(11)$, giving $\Gamma (\eta_b \to \gamma \gamma) = 0.559(32)_{\text{fit}}(1)_{\text{syst}} \: \mathrm{keV}$. Combined with a value for the branching fraction from NRQCD, our result can be used to determine the total width of the $\eta_b$ with a $6\%$ uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'', that also arise at the Newtonian and post-Newtonian levels, track the transition scale set by the halo parameters that control the strong-lensing upturn and can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.</description>

      <title>Medium effects on the electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho$ meson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of partons inside the light $\rho$ meson is found to be essential for its properties and internal structure, both in free space and in the nuclear medium. In this paper, we systematically investigate the in-medium structure changes of $\rho^+$ mesons within the covariant Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, utilizing the Schwinger proper-time regularization scheme. We solve the Bethe-Salpeter equations to guarantee the bound meson-state condition. At the quark level, the nuclear medium effects are also derived within the same NJL model to maintain a consistent approach with the in-medium $\rho^+$ meson electromagnetic form factors. To this end, we analyze the spacelike electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho^+$ meson in free space and in a nuclear medium. We find that the charge radius and quadrupole moment of the $\rho^+$ meson increase with increasing nuclear matter density, while the magnetic moment decreases, in agreement with the existing previous theoretical predictions. The enhancement of the $\rho^+$ meson charge radius at normal density relative to that in free space is about 11\% (0.08 fm), while the reduction of $\rho^+$ meson magnetic moment is about 8\% (0.20 $\mu_N$). Our predictions for the charge radius, magnetic moment, and quadrupole moment of the $\rho^+$ meson in both free space and nuclear medium, remain challenging to be verified experimentally.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive sensitivity study of future CE$\nu$NS detectors, focusing on a cryogenic cesium iodide detector and a tonne-scale liquid argon one, currently being developed by the COHERENT Collaboration. These setups will enable precision measurements of the weak mixing angle at low energies and allow accurate extraction of the neutron nuclear distribution radius. We also demonstrate that next-generation detectors will place constraints on the neutrino charge radius comparable to or better than current global fits. In addition, we explore the sensitivity to non standard neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as magnetic moments and millicharges, as well as new mediators. These findings reinforce the role of CE$\nu$NS experiments in the upcoming precision era, with future detectors playing a key role in advancing our understanding of neutrino interactions and electroweak physics at low energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Cha\^ine des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark. This work establishes a new application of the paleo-detector technique for long-scale time-domain high-energy astrophysics and provides the direct scientific motivation for experimental efforts to measure these track records.</description>

Abstract: We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson-meson, meson-baryon, and baryon-baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Generalized Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models from Type IIA Intersecting D6-Branes</title>

Abstract: Generalizing three-family chiral fermion conditions to $I_{ac}=-(3+h)$ and $I_{ac'}=h$, with positive integer $h$, we extend the landscape of three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in a broader region. Differing from the former investigation with $I_{ac}=-3$ and $I_{ac'}=0$, we do not restrict that the $a$ stack of D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold image of the $c$-stack along one of the three two-tori. In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes. Moreover, with the $SU(2)_{L'}$ gauge coupling realized from $SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$ symmetry breaking, the canonical normalization requirement of the gauge kinetic term provides an alternative approach that can be imposed before the renormalization group equation evolution for $SU(2)_{L'}$ gauge coupling. This turns out to be an effective mechanism to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relation, especially for the new supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with large $g_b/g_a$ ratio. We show that this symmetry-breaking modified renormalization group evolution can highly suppress $g_b/g_a$, and finally realizes string-scale gauge coupling relations for the extended supersymmetric Pati-Salam models as well.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of dark matter halos in galaxies and their effects on motion of stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20952</link>

Abstract: Matter and dark matter in galaxies represent two main components linked by the gravitational interaction. Collisions of galaxies may create an offset between the centres of mass of these components. Ignoring the internal dynamics of particles in the dark matter halo and the Keplerian rotation of matter in the galaxy, we focus on the possible relative oscillations of the matter component as a whole within the dark matter halo. We estimate the amplitude and frequency of these oscillations assuming that the offset of the centres of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations.</description>

      <title>Structure of Chern-Simons Graviton Scattering Amplitudes from Topological Graviton Equivalence Theorem and Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10870</link>

Abstract: Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a Topological Graviton Equivalence Theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>The Nucleon Axial Form Factor from Elementary Target Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14097</link>

Abstract: Precise neutrino-nucleon amplitudes are essential ingredients for predicting neutrino event rates in current and upcoming long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. A common neutrino interaction with a low reaction threshold and with most of the energy carried by two final state particles is quasielastic scattering, for which the nucleon axial form factor, $F_{A}(Q^{2})$, is a dominant source of uncertainty. Improvements to the nucleon axial form factor rely on neutrino scattering data with elementary targets to reduce or eliminate the need for nuclear modeling systematics. This work examines constraints on the nucleon axial form factor that can be achieved from datasets of neutrino scattering on deuterium targets, Lattice QCD predictions, and from the recent hydrogen target data from the MINERvA Collaboration. Significant tension is found between hydrogen and deuterium target data, suggesting that extractions from deuterium underestimate both the central value and uncertainty of the form factor. Parameterizations for and uncertainties of the nucleon axial form factor using the $z$ expansion are provided.</description>
