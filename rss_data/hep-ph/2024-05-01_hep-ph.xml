      <title>Unifying Simulation and Inference with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>

      <title>Axion Searches Go Deep Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to investigate the time modulation of radioisotope decays deep underground as a method to explore axion dark matter. In this work, we focus on the $\alpha$-decay of heavy isotopes and develop a theoretical description for the $\theta$-dependence of $\alpha$-decay half-lives, which enables us to predict the time variation of $\alpha$-radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. To probe this scenario, we have recently constructed and installed a setup deep underground at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the $\alpha$-decay of Americium-241. This prototype experiment, named RadioAxion-$\alpha$, will allow us to explore a broad range of oscillation's periods, from a few micro-seconds up to one year, thus providing competitive limits on the axion decay constant across 13 orders of magnitude in the axion mass, ranging from $10^{-9}$ eV to $10^{-20}$ eV after one month of data collection, and down to $10^{-22}$ eV after three years.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading Order Unitarity Fits in the Extended Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal triplet scalar extension of the Standard Model demanding custodial symmetry gives rise to the extended Georgi-Machacek (eGM) model. We compute one-loop corrections to all $2 \rightarrow 2$ bosonic scattering amplitudes in the eGM model, and place next-to-leading order (NLO) unitarity bounds on the quartic couplings. Additionally, we derive state-of-the-art constraints on the quartic couplings demanding the stability of the scalar potential. We perform a global fit of the eGM model to these theoretical bounds and to the latest Higgs signal strength results from the LHC detectors. In addition to the custodial symmetry, imposing a global $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetry on the scalar potential at the electroweak scale results in the well-known Georgi-Machacek (GM) model. We assess the impact of the state-of-the-art theoretical constraints on the fit to the Higgs signal strength data in the GM model, with particular emphasis on the NLO unitarity bounds. We observe that the global fit disfavors the region where $\kappa_V$ is greater than $1.05$ with a 95.4\% confidence level. We obtain an upper limit on the absolute values of the quartic couplings to be 1.9 (4.2) and see that the absolute mass differences between the heavy Higgs bosons cannot exceed 400 GeV (380 GeV) in the GM (eGM) model. Finally, we find that the maximal mass splitting within the members of custodial symmetric multiplets is restricted to be smaller than 210 GeV in the eGM model.</description>

      <title>Strongly vs. weakly coupled in-medium showers: energy stopping in large-$N_f$ QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inside a medium, showers originating from a very high-energy particle may develop via medium-induced splitting processes such as hard bremsstrahlung or pair production. During shower development, two consecutive splittings sometimes overlap quantum mechanically, so that they cannot be treated independently. Some of these effects can be absorbed into an effective value of a medium parameter known as $\hat q$. Previous calculations (with certain simplifying assumptions) have found that, after adjusting the value of $\hat q$, the leftover effect of overlapping splittings is quite small for purely gluonic large-$N_c$ showers but is very much larger for large-$N_f$ QED showers, at comparable values of $N\alpha$. Those works did not quite make for apples-to-apples comparisons: the gluon shower work investigated energy deposition from a gluon-initiated shower, whereas the QED work investigated charge-deposition from an electron-initiated shower. As a first step to tighten up the comparison, this paper investigates energy deposition in the QED case. Along the way, we develop a framework that should be useful in the future to explore whether the very small effect of overlapping splitting in purely gluonic showers is an artifact of having ignored quarks.</description>

      <title>ALP-ine quests at the LHC: hunting axion-like particles via peaks and dips in $t \bar{t}$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the sensitivity of current and future LHC searches for new spin-0 particles in top-anti-top-quark ($t\bar{t}$) final states, focusing on generic axion-like particles (ALPs) that are coupled to top quarks and gluons. As a first step, we derive new limits on the effective ALP Lagrangian in terms of the Wilson coefficients $c_t$ and $c_{\tilde{G}}$ based on the results of the CMS search using $35.9$ fb$^{-1}$ of data, collected at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. We then investigate how the production of an ALP with generic couplings to gluons and top quarks can be distinguished from the production of a pseudoscalar which couples to gluons exclusively via a top-quark loop. To this end, we make use of the invariant $t\bar{t}$ mass distribution and angular correlations that are sensitive to the $t\bar{t}$ spin correlation. Using a mass of 400 GeV as an example, we find that already the data collected during Run 2 and Run 3 of the LHC provides an interesting sensitivity to the underlying nature of a possible new particle. We also analyze the prospects for data anticipated to be collected during the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. Finally, we compare the limits obtained from the $t \bar t$ searches to existing experimental bounds from LHC searches for narrow di-photon resonances, from measurements of the production of four top quarks, and from global analyses of ALP-SMEFT interference effects.</description>

      <title>BSMPT v3 A Tool for Phase Transitions and Primordial Gravitational Waves in Extended Higgs Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong first-order phase transitions (SFOPT) during the evolution of the Higgs potential in the early universe not only allow for the dynamical generation of the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry, they can also source a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background possibly detectable with future space-based gravitational waves interferometers. As SFOPTs are phenomenologically incompatible with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs sector, the observation of GWs from SFOPTs provides an exciting interplay between cosmology and particle physics in the search for new physics. With the C++ code BSMPTv3, we present for the first time a tool that performs the whole chain from the particle physics model to the gravitational wave spectrum. Extending the previous versions BSMPTv1 and v2, it traces the phases of beyond-SM (BSM) Higgs potentials and is capable of treating multiple vacuum directions and multi-step phase transitions. During the tracing, it checks for discrete symmetries, flat directions, and electroweak symmetry restoration, and finally reports the transition history. The transition probability from the false to the true vacuum is obtained from the solution of the bounce equation which allows for the calculation of the nucleation, percolation and completion temperatures. The peak amplitude and frequency of the GWs originating from sound waves and turbulence, are evaluated after the calculation of the thermal parameters at the transition temperature, and finally the signal-to-noise ratio at LISA is provided. The code BSMPTv3 is a powerful self-contained tool that comes more than timely and will be of great benefit for investigations of the vacuum structure of the early universe of not only simple but also complicated Higgs potentials involving several vacuum directions, with exciting applications in the search for new physics.</description>

      <title>Coscattering in the Extended Singlet-Scalar Higgs Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coscattering mechanism in a simple Higgs portal which add two real singlet scalars to the Standard Model. In this scenario, the lighter scalar is stabilized by a single $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry and acts as the dark matter relic, whose freeze-out is driven by conversion processes. The heavier scalar becomes an unstable state which participate actively in the coscattering. We find viable parameter regions fulfilling the measured relic abundance, while evading direct detection and big-bang nucleosynthesis bounds. In addition, we discuss collider prospects for the heavier scalar as a long-lived particle at present and future detectors.</description>

      <title>CP Violation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and the subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. The verification of CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review.</description>

      <title>Large CP violation in charmed baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic numerical study of CP violation in two-body weak decays of antitriplet charmed baryons. In the standard model, the $\Delta c =1$ quark level interactions inducing CP violation for the relevant decays can be grouped into two types, proportional to the CKM matrix elements $\lambda_q= V_{uq}V^*_{cq}$ with $q=d$ and $q=b$, respectively. Recent studies have shown that with $SU(3)_F$ flavor symmetry, the decay amplitudes, including their strong phases, can be determined by data if contributions from $\lambda_b$ are neglected. However, terms proportional to $\lambda_b$ must be retained to create interferences that induce CP violation. Some of the $\lambda_b$ terms can be recovered in the framework of $SU(3)_F$ flavor symmetry, and the CP-violating rate asymmetry $A_{CP}$ is predicted to be of the order of ${\cal O}(10^{-4})$. We find that final state re-scattering effects, which link $\lambda_d$ and $\lambda_b$ terms, can help recover the missing terms. The re-scattering effects can enhance CP violation by an order of magnitude, with $A_{CP} (\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-) - A_{CP} (\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-)$ being as large as $1.87 \times 10^{-3}$. This makes it promising to observe CP violation for the first time in baryon decays.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrino signals from supernova explosions: a new window into dark photon parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons, hypothetical feebly interacting massive vector bosons, appear in many extensions of the Standard Model. This study investigates their production and subsequent decay during supernova explosions. We demonstrate that the decay of dark photons, with masses ranging from 200 to 400 MeV, can lead to the emission of neutrinos with energies surpassing those emitted by supernovae. These neutrinos therefore serve as a distinct signal of new physics, allowing for the exploration of previously uncharted regions of the dark photon parameter space and complementing both accelerator-based searches and other astrophysical constraints. The signal is largely unaffected by the specifics of the supernova's temperature and density radial profiles outside the SN core, rendering the prediction both robust and model-independent. Our results indicate that searching for high-energy neutrinos accompanying supernova explosions provides a novel approach to probe physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark photons, heavy neutral leptons, and other feebly interacting particles with masses in the hundreds of MeV range.</description>

      <title>Does the Electron EDM Preclude Electroweak Baryogenesis ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) constitutes a theoretically compelling and experimentally testable mechanism for explaining the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). New results for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron place significant constraints on the beyond Standard Model CP-violation needed for successful EWBG. We show how new developments in EWBG quantum transport theory that include CP-violating sources first order in gradients imply more relaxed EDM constraints than implied by previous approximation formulations. Consequently, EWBG remains viable even in light of present EDM bounds. We also illustrate how these developments enable a more realistic treatment of CP-conserving interactions that can also have a decisive impact on the predicted BAU.</description>

      <title>$CP$-violating observables of four-body $B_{(s)} \to (\pi\pi)(K\bar{K})$ decays in perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate six helicity amplitudes of the four-body $B_{(s)} \to (\pi\pi)(K\bar{K})$ decays in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The $\pi\pi$ invariant mass spectrum is dominated by the vector resonance $\rho(770)$ together with scalar resonance $f_0(980)$, while the vector resonance $\phi(1020)$ and scalar resonance $f_0(980)$ are expected to contribute in the $K\bar{K}$ invariant mass range. We extract the two-body branching ratios ${\cal B}(B_{(s)}\to \rho\phi)$ from the corresponding four-body decays $B_{(s)}\to \rho\phi\to (\pi\pi)(K \bar K)$. The predicted ${\cal B}(B^0_{s}\to \rho\phi)$ agrees well with the current experimental data within errors. The longitudinal polarization fractions of the $B_{(s)}\to \rho\phi$ decays are found to be as large as $90\%$, basically consistent with the previous two-body predictions within uncertainties. In addition, the triple-product asymmetries (TPAs) of the considered decays are also presented for the first time. Since the $B_s^0\to \rho^0\phi\to(\pi^+\pi^-)(K^+K^-)$ decay is induced by both tree and penguin operators, the values of the ${\cal A}^{\rm CP}_{\rm dir}$ and ${\cal A}^{1}_{\text{T-true}}$ are calculated to be $(21.8^{+2.7}_{-3.3})\%$ and $(-10.23^{+1.73}_{-1.56})\%$ respectively. While for pure penguin decays $B^0\to \rho^0\phi\to(\pi^+\pi^-)(K^+K^-)$ and $B^+\to \rho^+\phi\to(\pi^+\pi^0)(K^+K^-)$, both the direct $CP$ asymmetries and ``true" TPAs are naturally expected to be zero in the standard model (SM). The ``fake" TPAs requiring no weak phase difference are usually none zero for all considered decay channels. The sizable ``fake" ${\cal A}^{1}_{\text{T-fake}}=(-20.92^{+6.26}_{-2.80})\%$ of the $B^0\to \rho^0\phi\to(\pi^+\pi^-)(K^+K^-)$ decay is predicted in the PQCD approach, which provides valuable information on the final-state interactions.Our predictions can be tested by the future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helicity correlation of two back-to-back hadrons is a powerful tool that makes it possible to probe the longitudinal spin transfer, $G_{1L}$, in unpolarized hadronic collisions. In this work, we investigate the helicity correlation of back-to-back dihadrons produced in photon-nucleus collisions with both space-like and quasireal photons and explore its potential in understanding the flavor dependence of spin-dependent fragmentation functions. We present helicity amplitudes of partonic scatterings with both virtual and real photons and make numerical predictions for the dihadron helicity correlations at the future Electron Ion Collider experiment and the current RHIC/LHC ultra-peripheral collision experiment. Future experimental measurements can also illuminate the fragmentation function of circularly polarized gluons.</description>

      <title>NMSSM Explanation for Excesses in the Search for Neutralinos and Charginos and a 95 GeV Higgs Boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed excesses in the search for neutralinos and charginos by ATLAS and CMS can be fitted simultaneously in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) assuming a light higgsino mass, of magnitude less than about 250 GeV, and a compressed higgsino dominated neutralino and chargino spectrum, with $5-10\%$ mass splittings. However, light higgsinos as dark matter would have far too large direct detection cross sections. We consider the next-to-MSSM (NMSSM) with an additional singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) a few GeV below the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). Sparticles prefer to decay first into the NLSP and remnants from the final decay into the LSP are too soft to contribute to the observed signals. Co-annihilation in the higgsino-sector can generate a relic density in the WMAP/Planck window. The singlino-like LSP has automatically a direct detection cross section below present and future sensitivities: a direct detection signal in the near future would exclude this scenario. The singlet-like Higgs scalar of the NMSSM can have a mass around 95 GeV and signal cross sections in the $b\bar{b}$ channel at LEP and in the $\gamma\gamma$ channel at the LHC compatible with the respective observations.</description>

      <title>Small Instanton Effects on Composite Axion Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of small instanton effects on the axion mass in the composite accidental axion (CAA) models. These models are designed to address the axion quality problem, where QCD gauge symmetry is embedded as an unbroken diagonal subgroup of a product gauge group. These models contain small instantons not included in low-energy QCD, which could enhance the axion mass significantly. However, in the CAA models, our analysis reveals that these effects on the axion mass are non-vanishing but are negligible compared to the QCD effects. This highlights the important role of anomalous but non-spontaneously broken U(1) symmetries in restricting the impact of small instantons on the axion mass. Our study provides crucial insights into the dynamics within CAA models and suggests broader implications for understanding small instanton effects in other composite axion models.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Vector-like Lepton and Seesaw Mechanism:Oblique Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-vanishing neutrino mass strongly hints the existence of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), singlets of the standard model (SM). However, they are highly decoupled from the SM and difficult to probe. In this work, we consider the Majorana RHNs from the type-I seesaw mechanism may well mix with the heavy neutral lepton dwelling in certain vector-like lepton (VLL), thus acquiring a sizable electroweak charge. Such a simple scenario yields many interesting consequences, and the imprint on oblique corrections, well expected from the mass splitting between components of VLL by virtue of VLL-RHN mixing, is our focus here. We analytically calculate the Peskin-Takeuchi parameters S, T and U with full details, carefully treating the Majorana loop to obtain the self consistent expressions free of divergence. Then, we constrain on the VLL-RHN system which only gives a sizable $T$ parameter using the PDG-2021 data and CDF-II data, separately, by imposing $T\lesssim{\cal O}(0.1)$. It is found that for the RHN and VLL below the TeV scale, with a properly large mixing, stands in the frontier of the electroweak precision test such as W-boson mass.</description>

      <title>Soft pattern of gravitational Rutherford scattering from heavy target mass expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the soft behavior of the tree-level Rutherford scattering processes mediated via $t$-channel one-graviton exchange. We consider two types of Rutherford scattering processes, {\it e.g.}, a low-energy massless structureless projectile (up to spin-$1$) hits a static massive composite particle carrying various spins (up to spin-$2$), and a slowly-moving light projectile hits a heavy static composite target. The unpolarized cross sections in the first type are found to exhibit universal forms at the first two orders in $1/M$ expansion, yet differ at the next-to-next-to-leading order, though some terms at this order still remain universal or depend on the target spin in a definite manner. The unpolarized cross sections in the second type are universal at the lowest order in projectile velocity expansion and through all orders in $1/M$, independent of the spins of both projectile and target. The universality partially breaks down at relative order-$v^2/M^2$, albeit some terms at this order still depend on the target spin in a specific manner.</description>

      <title>Recent Neutrino Parameters Impact on the Effective Majorana Neutrino Mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of fermion level-crossing under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational chiral anomaly connects the topological charge of spacetime and the chirality of fermions. It has been known that the chirality is carried by the particles (or the excited states) and also by vacuum. While the gravitational anomaly equation has been applied to cosmology, distinction between these two contributions has been rarely discussed. In the study of gravitational leptogenesis, for example, lepton asymmetry associated with the chiral gravitational waves sourced during inflation is evaluated only by integrating the anomaly equation. How these two contributions are distributed has not been seriously investigated. Meanwhile, a dominance of vacuum contribution is observed in some specific types of Bianchi spacetime with parity-violating gravitational fields, whose application to cosmology is not straightforward. One may wonder whether such a vacuum dominance takes place also in the system with chiral gravitational waves around the flat background, which is more suitable for application to realistic cosmology. In this work, we apply an analogy between U(1) electromagnetism and the weak gravity to the spacetime that resembles the one considered in the gravitational leptogenesis scenario. This approach allows us to obtain intuitive understanding of the fermion chirality generation under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field. By assuming the emergence of Landau level-like dispersion relation in our setup, we conjecture that level-crossing does not seem to be efficient while the charge accumulation in the vacuum likely takes place. Phenomenological implication is also discussed in the context of gravitational leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>The Width of an Electron-Capture Neutrino Wave Packet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand on the methodology outlined in previous work that predicted the width of an antineutrino wave packet emerging from a beta-decaying nucleus, to the case of a neutrino from electron capture decay. Based on this result, we also respond to a recent Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions Experiment (BeEST) paper which utilizes this previous work in forming their measurement of the neutrino wave packet width. According to our interpretation, the direct limit on the neutrino wave packet width from electron capture decay ($e^- + \mathrm{^{7}Be}\rightarrow\mathrm{^{7}Li+\nu_e}$) using the BeEST analysis should map to $\sigma_{\nu,x}&gt;6.2\,\mathrm{pm}$ while our theoretical prediction is $\sigma_{\nu,x}\sim2.7\,\mathrm{nm}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate the structure of $E_8$ under the action of the subalgebra/subgroup $A_1+G_2+C_3$, as a potential route to unification of the fundamental forces of nature into a single algebraic structure. The particular real form $E_{8(-24)}$ supports a decomposition into compact $G_2$ plus split $A_1+C_3$, which allows a restriction from $G_2$ to $SU(3)$ for QCD, together with split $SL_2(\mathbb R)$ to break the symmetry of the weak interaction and give mass to the bosons. The factor $C_3$ contains a copy of the Lorentz group $SL_2(\mathbb C)$ and extends the `spacetime' symmetries to the full group of symplectic symmetries of $3+3$-dimensional phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild black hole can be ``resolved'' into bound states of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in four dimensions. These bound states closely resemble the Schwarzschild geometry from the asymptotic region up to an infinitesimal distance away from the Schwarzschild horizon. Below this scale, the horizon is replaced by novel spacetime structures supported by intense and entrapped electromagnetic flux. The flux originates from collinear black holes that can be brought arbitrarily close to extremality. We find that the charge distribution follows a universal pattern, with magnitudes scaling proportionally to the total mass and alternating in sign. Moreover, the bound states always have an entropy that constitutes a fraction of the Schwarzschild entropy. Constructed in four dimensions, the black holes are kept apart by struts, for which we analyze tensions and energies. These solutions pave the way for analogous constructions in supergravity and for a brane/anti-brane description of the Schwarzschild black hole in string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions can play an important role in the cosmological constant problem, allowing the underlying vacuum energy, and therefore the value of the cosmological constant, to change. Deep within the core of neutron stars, the local pressure may be sufficiently high to trigger the QCD phase transition, thus generating a shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The gravitational effects of such a transition should then be imprinted on the properties of the star. Working in the framework of General Relativity, we provide a new model of the stellar interior, allowing for a QCD and a vacuum energy phase transition. We determine the impact of a vacuum energy jump on mass-radius relations, tidal deformability-radius relations, I-Love-Q relations and on the combined tidal deformability measured in neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on spatially-flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and XCDM cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 6 LCDM models, with 4 allowing for non-flat geometry and 3 allowing for a non-unity lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We also study 6 XCDM models with a dynamical dark energy density X-fluid with equation of state $w$. For the non-flat models we use two different primordial power spectra, Planck $P(q)$ and new $P(q)$. These models are tested against: Planck 2018 CMB power spectra (P18) and lensing potential power spectrum (lensing), and an updated compilation of BAO, SNIa, $H(z)$, and $f\sigma_8$ data [non-CMB data]. P18 data favor closed geometry for the LCDM and XCDM models and $w&lt;-1$ (phantom-like dark energy) for the XCDM models while non-CMB data favor open geometry for the LCDM models and closed geometry and $w&gt;-1$ (quintessence-like dark energy) for the XCDM models. When P18 and non-CMB data are jointly analyzed there is weak evidence for open geometry and moderate evidence for quintessence-like dark energy. Regardless of data used, $A_L&gt;1$ is always favored. The XCDM model constraints obtained from CMB data and from non-CMB data are incompatible, ruling out the 3 $A_L = 1$ XCDM models at $&gt; 3\sigma$. In the 9 models not ruled out, for the P18+lensing+non-CMB data set we find little deviation from flat geometry and moderate deviation from $w=-1$. In all 6 non-flat models (not ruled out), open geometry is mildly favored, and in all 3 XCDM+$A_L$ models (not ruled out) quintessence-like dark energy is moderately favored (by at most $1.6 \sigma$). In the $A_L = 1$ non-flat LCDM cases, we find for P18+lensing+non-CMB data $\Omega_k = 0.0009 \pm 0.0017$ [$0.0008 \pm 0.0017$] for the Planck [new] $P(q)$ model, favoring open geometry. The flat LCDM model remains the simplest (largely) observationally-consistent cosmological model. Our cosmological parameter constraints obtained for the flat LCDM model (and other models) are the most restrictive results to date (Abridged).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are the least known particle in the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. They play a crucial role in cosmology, governing the universe's evolution and shaping the large-scale structures we observe today. In this chapter, we review crucial topics in neutrino cosmology, such as the neutrino decoupling process in the very early universe. We shall also revisit the current constraints on the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom and the departures from its standard expectation of 3. Neutrino masses represent the very first departure from the Standard Model of elementary particle physics and may imply the existence of new unexplored mass generation mechanisms. Cosmology provides the tightest bound on the sum of neutrino masses, and we shall carefully present the nature of these constraints, both on the total mass of the neutrinos and on their precise spectrum. The ordering of the neutrino masses plays a major role in the design of future neutrino mass searches from laboratory experiments, such as neutrinoless double beta decay probes. Finally, we shall also present the futuristic perspectives for an eventual direct detection of cosmic, relic neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theory compactified on an orbifold is defined by gauge symmetry, matter contents, and boundary conditions. There are equivalence classes (ECs), each of which consists of physically equivalent boundary conditions. We propose the powerful necessary conditions, trace conservation laws (TCLs), which achieve a sufficient classification of ECs in U(N) and SU(N) gauge theories on $T^2/Z_m$ orbifolds $(m=2,3,4,6)$. The TCLs yield the equivalent relations between the diagonal boundary conditions without relying on an explicit form of gauge transformations. The TCLs also show the existence of off-diagonal ECs, which consist only of off-diagonal matrices, on $T^2/Z_4$ and $T^2/Z_6$. After the sufficient classification, the exact numbers of ECs are obtained.</description>

Abstract: We discretize Chern-Simons couplings in gauge invariant way. We obtain (p+q)-forms representing Chern-Simons couplings on (p + q)-simplexes from wedge products of p- and q-forms on p- and q-simplexes, respectively, where p- and q-simplexes form (p+q)-simplexes by having a common vertex. We show that the Chern-Simons couplings on simplicial complexes reduce to Chern-Simons couplings on the manifolds in a continuum limit. Moreover, we prove that a typical discretized Chern-Simons term that has the Chern-Simons coupling is gauge invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally known for $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theory at finite temperature that phase transitions are manifested by taking the large-$N$ limit. Since the large-$N$ theory undergoes two thermodynamic phase transitions, a nontrivial intermediate phase can be realized in addition to the phases classified as the conventional confined and deconfined phases. In this talk, we discuss that a similar picture can be applied to QCD with $N=3$. In particular, we analyze the gauge configurations of lattice QCD calculations involving dynamical quarks and show the results of an analysis of the deviation due to finite-temperature effects from the Haar randomness expected at zero temperature in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theory, using physical pictures suggested by the large-$N$ theory.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic negative magnetoresistance from the chiral anomaly of multifold fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral anomaly, a hallmark of chiral spin-1/2 Weyl fermions, is an imbalance between left- and right-moving particles that underpins both high and low energy phenomena, including particle decay and negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in Weyl semimetals. The discovery that chiral crystals can host higher-spin generalizations of Weyl quasiparticles without high-energy counterparts, known as multifold fermions, raises the fundamental question of whether the chiral anomaly is a more general phenomenon. Answering this question requires materials with chiral quasiparticles within a sizable energy window around the Fermi level, that are unaffected by trivial extrinsic effects such as current jetting. Here we report the chiral anomaly of multifold fermions in CoSi, which features multifold bands within about 0.85 eV around the Fermi level. By excluding current jetting through the squeezing test, we measure an intrinsic, longitudinal negative magnetoresistance. We develop the semiclassical theory of magnetotransport of multifold fermions that shows that the negative magnetoresistance originates in their chiral anomaly, despite a sizable and detrimental orbital magnetic moment contribution, previously unaccounted for. A concomitant nonlinear Hall effect supports the multifold-fermion origin of magnetotransport. Our work confirms the chiral anomaly of higher-spin generalizations of Weyl fermions, currently inaccessible outside the solid-state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) \cite{DESI:2024mwx} combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.</description>

Abstract: The IceCube collaboration has identified neutrinos of energy $\sim 10-100$ TeV from the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the active galaxy NGC 1068, which must have traveled through a dense dark matter spike surrounding the supermassive black holes that power the galactic nuclei. We use this to set new constraints on dark matter-neutrino scattering, and interpret the results in terms of a dark photon that couples to baryon minus lepton number.</description>

      <title>Prospects for weighing neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of future gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations to constrain the total neutrino mass in some typical interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We examine the combined potential of the third-generation ground-based GW detector network and a short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector similar to the THESEUS telescope for cosmological analysis. Our findings suggest that future GW standard siren observations could modestly refine the upper limit on the total neutrino mass, enhancing it by $5\%$ to $10\%$ over the existing limit given by the CMB+BAO+SN data. Additionally, the future observations are expected to significantly improve the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$. Moreover, the measurements could enhance the precision of the coupling strength $\beta$ by $23\%$ to $42\%$.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of the Tunneling Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tunneling Potential Formalism was introduced to calculate the tunneling actions that control vacuum decay as an alternative to the standard Euclidean Formalism. The new approach sets the problem as a simple variational problem in field space with decay described by a tunneling potential function $V_t$ that extremizes a simple action functional $S[V_t]$ and has a number of appealing properties that have been presented elsewhere. In this note I discuss several instances in which this $V_t$ approach seems to give more than one would have expected a priori, as the following: the $V_t$ describing the decay is a minimum of the new action $S[V_t]$ rather than a saddle point; the decay of AdS, dS or Minkowski vacua are governed by a unique universal $S[V_t]$ which also gives the Hawking-Moss instanton in the appropriate limit; physically relevant solutions beyond the Coleman-De Luccia (CdL) bounce, like pseudo-bounces or bubbles of nothing (BoNs), show up in a straightforward way as generalizations of the CdL bounce, with the correct boundary conditions; in cases for which the Euclidean action calculation requires the inclusion of particular boundary terms (like for BoNs or for the decay of AdS maxima above the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound) $S[V_t]$ gives the correct result without the need of including any boundary term.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$-equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the results of previous studies in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>

      <title>Assisted baryon number violation from $4k+2$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton decay in six dimensions orbifolded on square $T^2/Z_2$ is highly suppressed at tree-level. This is because baryon number violating (BNV) operators containing only the zero mode of bulk fermions must satisfy the selection rule $\frac{3}{2} \Delta B \pm \frac{1}{2}\Delta L = 0 \ mod \ 4$. In this article, we show that the above relation does not prohibit mass dimension-6 BNV operators containing Kaluza Klein (KK) partners of the bulk fermions. Together with `spinless' adjoint scalar partner of hypercharge gauge boson (the Dark Matter candidate), these novel operators generate Dark Matter assisted proton decay at mass dimension-8. Here, with explicit examples of scalar and vector baryon number violating interactions, we discuss the importance of such $\Delta B=1 =\Delta L$ and $\Delta B=2=\Delta L$ operators and derive the limit on New Physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00930v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient approach for the general reduction of one-loop integrals. Our method employs the introduction of an auxiliary vector and the identification of the tensor structure as an auxiliary propagator. This key insight allows us to express a wide range of one-loop integrals, encompassing both tensor structures and higher poles, in the Baikov representation. By establishing an integral-by-parts (IBP) relation, we derive a recursive formula that systematically solves the one-loop reduction problem, even in the presence of various degenerate cases. Our proposed strategy is characterized by its simplicity and effectiveness, offering a significant advancement in the field of one-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the MiniBoone Excess with Searches at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the excess of low-energy events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment remains a mystery, despite exhaustive investigations of backgrounds and a series of null measurements from complementary experiments. One intriguing explanation is the production of beyond-the-Standard-Model particles that could mimic the experimental signature of additional $\nu_e$ appearance seen in MiniBooNE. In one proposed mechanism, muon neutrinos up-scatter to produce a new ``dark neutrino'' state that decays by emitting highly-collimated electron-positron pairs. We propose high-energy neutrinos produced from $W$ boson decays at the Large Hadron Collider as an ideal laboratory to study such models. Simple searches for a low-mass, boosted di-lepton resonance produced in association with a high-$p_\text{T}$ muon from the $W$ decay with Run 2 data would already provide unique sensitivity to a range of dark neutrino scenarios, with prompt and displaced searches providing complementarity. Looking farther ahead, we show how the unprecedented sample of $W$ boson decays anticipated at the HL-LHC, together with improved lepton acceptance would explore much of the parameter space most compatible with the MiniBooNE excess.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Classification of Sphalerons and Black Holes at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In models with large extra dimensions, "miniature" black holes (BHs) might be produced in high-energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the semi-classical regime, those BHs thermally decay, giving rise to large-multiplicity final states with jets and leptons. On the other hand, similar final states are also expected in the production of electroweak sphaleron/instanton-induced processes. We investigate whether one can discriminate these scenarios when BH or sphaleron-like events are observed in the LHC using machine learning (ML) methods. Classification among several BH scenarios with different numbers of extra dimensions and the minimal BH masses is also examined. In this study we consider three ML models: XGBoost algorithms with (1) high- and (2) low-level inputs, and (3) a Residual Convolutional Neural Network. In the latter case, the low-level detector information is converted into an input format of three-layer binned event images, where the value of each bin corresponds to the energy deposited in various detector subsystems. We demonstrate that only a small number of detected events are sufficient to effectively discriminate between the sphaleron and BH processes. Separation between BH scenarios with different minimal masses is possible with an order of 10 events passing the preselection. A sufficient number of events could be observed in combined Run-2 and -3 data, if the production cross section is not much smaller than the present limit ~ 0.1 fb. We find, however, that a large number of events is needed to discriminate between BH hypotheses with the same minimal BH mass, but different numbers of extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>SKA Sensitivity to Sub-GeV Dark Matter Decay: Synchrotron Radio Emissions in White Dwarf Magnetospheres</title>

Abstract: We investigate the potential of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in detecting synchrotron radiation emitted from the decay of sub-GeV dark matter (dark matter with masses below the GeV scale) in the presence of strong magnetic fields. As a concrete setup, we consider scenarios where the magnetosphere of a magnetic white dwarf overlaps with dense dark matter environments, such as those surrounding a primordial black hole. Our study reveals that the encounters of compact objects such as white dwarfs and black holes offer a promising avenue for upcoming radio telescopes to probe the properties of light dark matter, which has been less explored compared with more conventional heavier (masses above the GeV scale) dark matter.</description>

      <title>A model of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter with two complex scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) dark matter (DM) is a promising DM candidate and able to explain the measured DM abundance by the thermal freeze-out mechanism evading the stringent bound from DM direct detection experiments. We propose a new model providing a pNG DM by introducing two Standard-Model-singlet complex scalars with the same charges of a dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. They are also charged under a $U(1)$ global symmetry corresponding to their relative phase rotations, which is explicitly broken by a soft-breaking term in the scalar potential. The both $U(1)$ symmetries are spontaneously broken by their vacuum expectation values, giving rise to one real pNG boson. We also introduce a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging the two scalars to stabilize the pNG boson as DM. It is shown that this model reproduces the DM abundance consistently with the current bound from the direct detection experiments. The model has a gauge kinetic mixing between the dark and $U(1)_Y$ gauge fields, which allows the dark gauge boson to decay even with a relatively light mass and prevents it from being an additional DM component. The Landau pole is avoided thanks to the small gauge coupling constant. In addition, a DM pair dominantly annihilates into a pair of the dark gauge bosons if the gauge boson mass is lighter than the DM mass, and thus its cross section has significantly different parameter dependence from other pNG DM models. We also calculate the DM-nucleon scattering cross section at the loop level. It turns out that it is necessary to probe region covered by the neutrino fog in order to test this model.</description>

      <title>Role of $\rho-\omega$ interference in semileptonic $B \to \pi^+ \pi^- \ell \bar \nu_\ell$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is long known that interference effects play an important role in understanding the shape of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ spectrum of resonances near the threshold. In this manuscript we investigate the role of the $\rho-\omega$ interference in the study of semileptonic $B \to \pi^+ \pi^- \ell \bar \nu_\ell$ decays. We determine for the first time the strong phase between $B \to \rho^0 \ell \bar \nu_\ell$ and $B \to \omega \ell \bar \nu_\ell$ from a recent Belle measurement of the $m_{\pi\pi}$ spectrum of $B \to \pi^+ \pi^- \ell \bar \nu_\ell$. We find $ \phi_{\rho-\omega} = \left( -46_{-67}^{+155} \right)\unicode{xb0}$ and extract the branching fraction of $\mathcal{B}(B \to \rho^0 \ell \bar \nu_\ell) = \left(1.41_{-0.38}^{+0.49} \right) \times 10^{-4} $. In addition, we set a limit on the $S$-wave component within a mass window ranging from $2 m_\pi$ to $1.02 \, \mathrm{GeV}$ of $ 0.51 \times 10^{-4} \,\, \mathrm{at} \, \, 90\% \, \mathrm{CL} $. We also determine the absolute value of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element of $|V_{ub}|_{\rho-\omega} = \left( 3.03^{+0.49}_{-0.44} \right) \times 10^{-3}$, which takes into account the $\rho-\omega$ interference.</description>

      <title>Extracting transition generalized parton distributions from hard exclusive pion-nucleon scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the extraction of transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from production of two back-to-back high transverse momentum photons ($\gamma\gamma$) and a massive pair of leptons ($\ell^+\ell^-$) in hard exclusive pion-nucleon scattering. We argue that the exclusive scattering amplitude of both processes could be factorized into nonperturbative pion distribution amplitude and nucleon transition GPDs that are convoluted with perturbatively calculable short-distance matching coefficients. We demonstrate that the exclusive diphoton production not only is complementary to the Drell-Yan-type dilepton production for extracting the GPDs, but also provides enhanced sensitivities for extracting the parton momentum fraction $x$ dependence of the GPDs. We show that both exclusive observables are physically measurable at the J-PARC and AMBER experiment energies. If the target nucleon can be polarized, corresponding spin asymmetries can offer additional sensitivities for extracting transition GPDs.</description>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of the Standard-Model Higgs: Electroweak Vacuum Stability during Kination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the vacuum stability of the non-minimally coupled Standard-Model Higgs during a phase of kinetic domination following the end of inflation. The non-minimal coupling to curvature stabilises the Higgs fluctuations during inflation while driving them towards the instability scale during kination, when they can classically overcome the potential barrier separating the false electroweak vacuum from the true one at super-Planckian field values. Avoiding the instability of the Standard-Model vacuum sets an upper bound on the inflationary scale that depends both on the strength of the non-minimal interaction and on the top quark Yukawa coupling. Classical vacuum stability is guaranteed if the gravitationally-produced energy density is smaller than the height of barrier in the effective potential. Interestingly enough, thanks to the explosive particle production in the tachyonic phase, the Higgs itself can be also appointed to the role of reheaton field responsible for the onset of the hot Big Bang era, setting an additional lower bound on the inflationary scale $\mathcal{H}_{\rm inf} \gtrsim 10^{5.5} \text{ GeV}$. Overall, these constraints favour lower masses for the top quark, in agreement with the current measurements of the top quark pole mass. We perform our analysis semi-analytically in terms of the one-loop and three-loop running of the Standard-Model Higgs self-coupling and make use of lattice-based parametric formulas for studying the (re)heating phase derived in arXiv:2307.03774. For a specific choice of $m_t=171.3 \text{ GeV}$ we perform also an extensive numerical scanning of the parameter space via classical lattice simulations, identifying stable/unstable regions and supporting the previous analytical arguments. For this fiducial value, the heating of the Universe is achieved at temperatures in the range $10^{-2} - 10^9 \text{ GeV}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the light quarkonium hybrid mesons of various spin-parities in QCD. Considering different interpolating currents made of the valence light quarks and single gluon, we calculate the mass and current coupling of the strange and nonstrange members of light hybrid mesons by including into computations the nonperturbative quark and gluon condensates up to ten dimensions in order to increase the accuracy of the results. The obtained results may be useful for future experimental searches of these hypothetical states. They can also be used in the calculations of different parameters related to the decays/interactions of light hybrid mesons to/with other states.</description>

Abstract: Compact stellar objects like supernovae and neutron stars are believed to cool by emitting axions predominantly via axion bremsstrahlung ($NN \to NNa$), pion conversion ($\pi^- p^+ \to N a$) and photo-production ($\gamma N \to N a$). In this paper, we study in detail the photo-production channel, from the unavoidable anomaly induced Wess-Zumino-Witten term $\propto \epsilon^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}\, F_{\mu \nu}\, \partial_\alpha a \, \omega_\beta$ in conjunction with the low energy pion photo-production data. We found that for heavier axions, i.e., $m_a\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV, photo-production processes can be dominant compared to the usual axion emission processes. In addition, the spectrum of axions emitted in the process is significantly harder than those originating from bremsstrahlung.</description>

Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Finite modular symmetries and the strong CP problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that modular symmetry may solve the strong CP problem without axions, by producing a vanishing QCD angle while generating a large quark CP violation phase. We extend this framework to finite modular groups, systematically identifying the allowed mass textures. We find quark fields must furnish 1D representations and scan the minimal model landscape.</description>

      <title>Two-loop integrals for $t \bar{t} +$jet production at hadron colliders in the leading colour approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the differential equations for the two remaining integral topologies contributing to the leading colour two-loop amplitudes for $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}j$. We derive differential equations for the master integrals by solving the integration-by-parts identities over finite fields. Of the two systems of differential equations, one is presented in canonical '${\rm d} \log$' form, while the other is found to have an elliptic sector. For the elliptic topology we identify the relevant elliptic curve, and present the differential equations in a more general form which depends quadratically on $\epsilon$ and contains non-logarithmic one-forms in addition to the canonical ${\rm d} \log$'s. We solve the systems of differential equations numerically using generalised series expansions with the boundary terms obtained using the auxiliary mass flow method. A summary of all one-loop and two-loop planar topologies is presented including the list of alphabet letters for the '${\rm d} \log$' form systems and high-precision boundary values.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical $x$-space solution for parton evolution -- Application to non-singlet and singlet DGLAP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel semi-analytical method for parton evolution. It is based on constructing a family of analytic functions spanning $x$-space which is closed under the considered evolution equation. Using these functions as a basis, the original integro-differential evolution equation transforms into a system of coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved numerically by restriction to a suitably chosen finite subsystem. The evolved distributions are obtained as analytic functions in $x$ with numerically obtained coefficients, providing insight into the analytic behavior of the evolved parton distributions. As a proof-of-principle, we apply our method to the leading order non-singlet and singlet DGLAP equation. Comparing our results to traditional Mellin-space methods, we find good agreement. The method is implemented in the code $\texttt{POMPOM}$ in $\texttt{Mathematica}$ as well as in $\texttt{Python}$.</description>

      <title>Approach to the arbitrariness problem of boundary conditions in $S^1/Z_2$ brane-world models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the arbitrariness of boundary conditions (BCs) on $S^1/Z_2$ brane-world models with the gauge group $U(N)$. The BCs are chosen independently on the branes and the bulk in this model. There are numerous choices for BCs in general, but some of the BCs are connected through gauge transformations. We show that the equivalent relations are obtained on the UV-brane without relying on specific transformation parameters. There is no other equivalent relation on the UV-brane. On the other hand, we find that a gauge transformation with a kink connects all the BCs on the bulk and IR-brane. It means that the arbitrariness of BCs is completely solved on the bulk and the IR-brane except for the UV-brane.</description>

      <title>Induced gravitational waves and baryon asymmetry fluctuations from primordial black hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider black hole formation due to the gravitational collapse produced by large density fluctuations during an epoch of reheating with a stiff equation of state and calculate the induced gravitational wave spectrum. By considering the existing bounds on the total energy density of gravitational waves today, we find constraints on the parameter space of this scenario. We also calculate the lepton asymmetry generated by metric perturbations via the chiral gravitational anomaly present in the Standard Model and find that, once the electroweak sphaleron processes have taken place, the large spectrum of scalar perturbations responsible for black hole formation induces a peak in the baryon asymmetry fluctuations on small scales.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on thermal transition in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the picture of partial deconfinement developed in recent years for large-$N$ gauge theories, we propose a new way of analyzing and understanding thermal phase transition in QCD. We find nontrivial support for our proposal by analyzing the WHOT-QCD collaboration's lattice configurations for SU(3) QCD in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions with up, down, and strange quarks.
  We find that the Polyakov line (the holonomy matrix around a thermal time circle) is governed by the Haar-random distribution at low temperatures. The deviation from the Haar-random distribution at higher temperatures can be measured via the character expansion, or equivalently, via the expectation values of the Polyakov loop defined by the various nontrivial representations of SU(3).
  We find that the Polyakov loop corresponding to the fundamental representation and loops in the higher representation condense at different temperatures. This suggests that there are (at least) three phases, one intermediate phase existing in between the completely-confined and the completely-deconfined phases. Our identification of the intermediate phase is supported also by the condensation of instantons: by studying the instanton numbers of the WHOT-QCD configurations, we find that the instanton condensation occurs for temperature regimes corresponding to what we identify as the completely-confined and intermediate phases, whereas the instantons do not condense in the completely-deconfined phase.
  Our characterization of confinement based on the Haar-randomness explains why the Polyakov loop is a good observable to distinguish the confinement and the deconfinement phases in QCD despite the absence of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ center symmetry.</description>

      <title>Pauli-Villars regularization of Kaluza-Klein Casimir energy with Lorentz symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli-Villars regularization is appropriate to discuss the UV sensitivity of low-energy observables because it mimics how the contributions of new particles at high energies cancel large quantum corrections from the light particles in the effective field theory. We discuss the UV sensitivity of the Casimir energy density and pressure in an extra-dimensional model in this regularization scheme, and clarify the condition on the regulator fields to preserve the Lorentz symmetry of the vacuum state. Some of the conditions are automatically satisfied in spontaneously-broken supersymmetric models, but supersymmetry is not enough to ensure the Lorentz symmetry. We show that the necessary regulators can be introduced as bulk fields. We also evaluate the Casimir energy density with such regulators, and its deviation from the result obtained in the analytic regularization.</description>

      <title>Mode Recombination Formula and Nonanalytic Term in Effective Potential at Finite Temperature on Compactified Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new formula called a mode recombination formula, and we can recast the effective potential at finite temperature in one-loop approximation for fermion and scalar fields on the $D$-dimensional spacetime, $S_{\tau}^1 \times R^{D-(p+1)}\times\prod_{i=1}^pS_i^1$ into a convenient form for discussing nonanalytic terms, which cannot be written in the form of any positive integer power of the field-dependent mass squared, in the effective potential. The formula holds irrespective of whether the field is a fermion or a scalar and of boundary conditions for spatial $S_i^1$ directions and clarifies the importance of zero modes in the Matsubara and Kaluza-Klein modes for the existence of the nonanalytic terms. The effective potential is drastically simplified further to obtain the nonanalytic terms in easier and more transparent way. In addition to reproducing previous results, we find that there exists no nonanalytic term for the fermion field with arbitrary boundary condition for the spatial $S_i^1$ direction, which is also the case for the scalar field with the antiperiodic boundary condition for the spatial direction.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>
