      <title>Harmonic projection and hypercentral extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Liouville property is a strong form of amenability, but contrary to amenability, it is not well-behaved under extensions. In this paper it is shown that, for some measures, the Liouville property is preserved by [FC-]hypercentral extensions. To this end a projection from $\ell^\infty$ onto the space of harmonic functions is introduced.</description>

      <title>Subsets of abelian groups closed under addition or subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we first describe all nonempty sets of integers S with the property that for all n and m in S, not necessarily distinct, the set {n-m,n+m} intersected with S consists of a single element. These are the sets with at most two elements, one of which is 0, and the infinite sets {rk}, where r is a fixed positive integer and k runs over all integers not divisible by 3.
  In the later sections, we solve the analogous problem for subsets of abelian groups. We also discuss, but do not completely solve, the analogous problem for nonabelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $p$ is a prime and $S$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$. If $S$ is normal in $G$, then $Z(S)$ is the direct product of $S \cap Z(G)$ with $[Z(S), G]$. We prove an analogous result for all groups except in some cases where $p=2$ and $G$ is not solvable, where we have counterexamples. We also extend this result to fusion systems.</description>

      <title>Non-stability of Liouville measures under convex combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every non-hyper-FC-central countable amenable group and every $k\geq 2$, we provide a sequence of symmetric, fully supported probability measures such that their convex combination is non-Liouville (that is it admits a non-constant bounded harmonic function, equivalently, the Poisson boundary is non-trivial) if and only if at least $k$ of them appear in the convex combination. Particularly, our result implies that the set of Liouville measures is not closed under convex combination, which answers a question of Kaimanovich. We also provide a similar result under the additional assumption of finite entropy for those non-hyper-FC-central countable groups with the property that every symmetric, finitely supported probability measure is Liouville. These groups are the only known non-trivial examples of countable groups that admit Liouville measures with finite entropy. Examples include the lamplighter group over $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and the infinite symmetric group of finite permutations on $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $\mathcal{C}$ a normal subset of $G$. The Gill-Guillot graph has vertices $\mathcal C$ and $x, y \in \mathcal C$ are adjacent if and only if $x$ and $y$ commute and $\{xy^{-1},x^{-1}y\} \cap \mathcal C$ is non-empty. We study the connectivity of this graph for quasisimple groups with $G/Z(G)$ a sporadic simple group and for certain simple groups with exceptional Schur multiplier.</description>

      <title>Random Groups at Density $d&lt;1/2$: Sharp Length Inequalities for Generalized Torsion and a Fixed-width Exclusion via First-order Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a random group in Gromov's density model $G(m,d,L)$ with $d&lt;\tfrac12$. We prove a sharp quantitative constraint on products of conjugates equal to the identity: for every $n\ge1$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, with overwhelming probability as $L\to\infty$, any tight word \[ W=\prod_{i=1}^n h_i^{-1} g h_i =1 \quad\text{in } G \] (with $g\neq 1$ as a word) satisfies the inequality \[ \sum_{i=1}^n \len{h_i} \;&gt;\; \frac{1-2d-\varepsilon}{2}\,L \;-\; \frac{n}{2}\,\len{g}. \] The proof is a short van Kampen diagram argument: Ollivier's sharp isoperimetric inequality forces a 2-cell contributing a large portion of its boundary to the outer boundary, and a simple boundary block-counting estimate yields this corridor-type lower bound. As consequences we obtain uniform short-witness exclusions and width--length tradeoffs for generalized torsion at every density $d&lt;\tfrac12$. We also deduce that random groups have no generalized torsion of any fixed width as a corollary of the recent first-order transfer theorem of Kharlampovich, Miasnikov, and Sklinos.</description>

      <title>Lines and opposition in Lie incidence geometries of exceptional type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise sets of points of exceptional Lie incidence geometries, that is, the natural geometries arising from spherical buildings of exceptional types $\mathsf{F_4}$, $\mathsf{E_6}$, $\mathsf{E_7}$, $\mathsf{E_8}$ and $\mathsf{G_2}$, that form a line using the opposition relation. With that, we obtain a classification of so-called ``geometric lines'' in many of these geometries. Furthermore, our results lead to a characterisation of geometric lines in finite exceptional Lie incidence geometries as minimal blocking sets, that is, point sets of the size of a line admitting no object opposite to all of their members, in most cases, and we classify all exceptions. As a further consequence, we obtain a characterisation of automorphisms of exceptional spherical buildings as certain opposition preserving maps.</description>

      <title>Word Measures on Symmetric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00897v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a word $w$ in a free group $F$ on $r$ generators. A $w$-random permutation in the symmetric group $S_N$ is obtained by sampling $r$ independent uniformly random permutations $\sigma_{1},\ldots,\sigma_{r}\in S_{N}$ and evaluating $w\left(\sigma_{1},\ldots,\sigma_{r}\right)$. In [arXiv:1104.3991, arXiv:1202.3269] it was shown that the average number of fixed points in a $w$-random permutation is $1+\theta\left(N^{1-\pi\left(w\right)}\right)$, where $\pi\left(w\right)$ is the smallest rank of a subgroup $H\le F$ containing $w$ as a non-primitive element. We show that $\pi\left(w\right)$ plays a role in estimates of all stable characters of symmetric groups. In particular, we show that for all $t\ge2$, the average number of $t$-cycles is $\frac{1}{t}+O\left(N^{-\pi\left(w\right)}\right)$. As an application, we prove that for every $s$, every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and every large enough $r$, Schreier graphs with $r$ random generators depicting the action of $S_{N}$ on $s$-tuples, have second eigenvalue at most $2\sqrt{2r-1}+\varepsilon$ asymptotically almost surely. An important ingredient in this work is a systematic study of not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</description>

      <title>Groups of Projectivities and Levi Subgroups in Spherical Buildings of Simply Laced Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the special and general projectivity groups attached to a simplex $F$ of a thick irreducible spherical building of simply laced type. If the residue of $F$ is irreducible, we determine the permutation group of both projectivity groups of $F$, acting on the residue of $F$ and show that the special projectivity group determines the precise action of the Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup on the corresponding residue. This reveals three special cases for the exceptional types $\mathsf{E_6,E_7,E_8}$. Furthermore, we establish a general diagrammatic rule to decide when exactly the special and general projectivity groups of $F$ coincide.</description>

Abstract: Let $q$ be a power of a fixed prime $p$. We classify up to isomorphism all simple saturated fusion systems on a certain class of $p$-groups constructed from the polynomial representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(q)$, which includes the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_3(q)$ and $\mathrm{Sp}_4(q)$ as special cases. The resulting list includes all Clelland--Parker fusion systems, a simple exotic fusion system discovered by Henke--Shpectorov, and a new infinite family of exotic examples.</description>

      <title>Structural and rigidity properties of Lie skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate structural and rigidity properties of \emph{Lie skew braces} (LSBs), objects essentially known in the literature as \emph{post--Lie groups}, obtained by endowing a manifold with two compatible group laws that share the same identity element. LSBs extend skew left braces, which are central to the study of non-involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, to the smooth category. Our first main result shows that, for every connected LSB $(G,\cdot,\circ)$, linearity (in the simply-connected case) and solvability carry over from $(G,\cdot)$ to $(G,\circ)$, whereas the converse direction is rigid: if $(G,\circ)$ is nilpotent (respectively, semisimple) then $(G,\cdot)$ is forced to be solvable (respectively, isomorphic to $(G,\circ)$). Our second results provides two ``flexibility'' statements: every non-linear simply connected Lie group \((G, \cdot )\) admits an LSB \((G,\cdot,\circ)\) such that \((G,\circ)\) is linear, and every simply connected solvable Lie group \((G, \circ )\) supports a LSB \((G,\cdot,\circ)\) such that \((G,\cdot)\) is nilpotent. A third result provides a complete existence table for non-trivial LSBs across the six standard Lie-group classes, abelian, nilpotent (non-abelian), solvable (non-nilpotent), simple, semisimple (non-simple) and mixed type, identifying precisely when a LSB can be built and when only the trivial or no structure occurs. Both the explicit constructions and the properties established in our theorems rely on a factorisation technique for Lie groups, on the correspondence between LSBs and regular subgroups of the affine group $\operatorname{Aff}(G,\cdot)$, which renders LSB theory equivalent to simply transitive affine actions, and on the theory of post-Lie algebras together with their integrability properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any arithmetic locally symmetric space is homotopy equivalent to a simplicial complex where the number of simplices is bounded linearly in the volume of the space. This settles a well-known conjecture of Gelander. The main technical ingredient, which is of independent interest, is a strengthened version of the Margulis' collar lemma for arithmetic locally symmetric spaces based on the height gap theorem of Breuillard, in which the Margulis constant is made linear in the degree of the trace field of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Randomized Geodesic Flow on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Gromov's geodesic flow problem on hyperbolic groups $G$, we develop in this paper an analog using random walks. This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^\mathbb{Z}$. Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined discrete flow that we call the \emph{randomized geodesic flow}, given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$. As a consequence of our construction, we prove that the randomized geodesic flow is exponentially mixing of all orders and establish a functional CLT.</description>

      <title>Hyper-u-amenablity and Hyperfiniteness of Treeable Equivalence Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of u-amenability and hyper-u-amenability for countable Borel equivalence relations, strong forms of amenability that are implied by hyperfiniteness. We show that treeable, hyper-u-amenable countable Borel equivalence relations are hyperfinite. One of the corollaries that we get is that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is measure-hyperfinite and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a free continuous action of a virtually free group on a $\sigma$-compact Polish space, then it is hyperfinite. We also obtain that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is treeable and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a Borel action of an amenable group on a standard Borel space, or if it is treeable, amenable and Borel bounded, then it is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of finite-dimensional nilpotent groups and Lie rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give some vanishing results for the first classical cohomology group in the case of finite-dimensional nilpotent groups and Lie rings. Based on the established cohomological results, we derive some structural consequences : we prove a form of Frattini's argument for definable connected Cartan subrings and we give a definable version of Maschke's theorem for the action of a definable connected p-divisible abelian group.</description>

      <title>Massless Representations in Conformal Space and Their de Sitter (dS) Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</description>
