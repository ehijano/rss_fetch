      <title>Temporal Many-valued Conditional Logics: a Preliminary Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a many-valued temporal conditional logic. We start from a many-valued logic with typicality, and extend it with the temporal operators of the Linear Time Temporal Logic (LTL), thus providing a formalism which is able to capture the dynamics of a system, trough strict and defeasible temporal properties. We also consider an instantiation of the formalism for gradual argumentation.</description>

      <title>The Challenges of Effective AGM Belief Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significant interest in extending the AGM paradigm of belief change beyond finitary logics, the computational aspects of AGM have remained almost untouched. We investigate the computability of AGM contraction on non-finitary logics, and show an intriguing negative result: there are infinitely many uncomputable AGM contraction functions in such logics. Drastically, even if we restrict the theories used to represent epistemic states, in all non-trivial cases, the uncomputability remains. On the positive side, we identify an infinite class of computable AGM contraction functions on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We use B\"uchi automata to construct such functions as well as to represent and reason about LTL knowledge.</description>

      <title>Minimal Model Counting via Knowledge Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting the number of models of a Boolean formula is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and reasoning. Minimal models of a Boolean formula are critical in various reasoning systems, making the counting of minimal models essential for detailed inference tasks. Existing research primarily focused on decision problems related to minimal models. In this work, we extend beyond decision problems to address the challenge of counting minimal models. Specifically, we propose a novel knowledge compilation form that facilitates the efficient counting of minimal models. Our approach leverages the idea of justification and incorporates theories from answer set counting.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Linear Arc Monadic Datalog and Gadget Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Datalog program solves a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) if and only if it derives the goal predicate precisely on the unsatisfiable instances of the CSP.
  There are three Datalog fragments that are particularly important for finite-domain constraint satisfaction: arc monadic Datalog, linear Datalog, and symmetric linear Datalog, each having good computational properties. We consider the fragment of Datalog where we impose all of these restrictions simultaneously, i.e., we study \emph{symmetric linear arc monadic (slam) Datalog}. We characterise the CSPs that can be solved by a slam Datalog program as those that have a gadget reduction to a particular Boolean constraint satisfaction problem. We also present exact characterisations in terms of a homomorphism duality (which we call \emph{unfolded caterpillar duality}), and in universal-algebraic terms (using known minor conditions, namely the existence of quasi Maltsev operations and $k$-absorptive operations of arity $nk$}, for all $n,k \geq 1$). Our characterisations also imply that the question whether a given finite-domain CSP can be expressed by a slam Datalog program is decidable.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Minimal Unsatisfiable Cores of LTLf formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces ($\text{LTL}_f$) is a widely used formalism with applications in AI, process mining, model checking, and more. The primary reasoning task for $\text{LTL}_f$ is satisfiability checking; yet, the recent focus on explainable AI has increased interest in analyzing inconsistent formulas, making the enumeration of minimal explanations for infeasibility a relevant task also for $\text{LTL}_f$. This paper introduces a novel technique for enumerating minimal unsatisfiable cores (MUCs) of an $\text{LTL}_f$ specification. The main idea is to encode a $\text{LTL}_f$ formula into an Answer Set Programming (ASP) specification, such that the minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of the ASP program directly correspond to the MUCs of the original $\text{LTL}_f$ specification. Leveraging recent advancements in ASP solving yields a MUC enumerator achieving good performance in experiments conducted on established benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <title>Directed equality with dinaturality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how dinaturality plays a central role in the interpretation of directed type theory where types are interpreted as (1-)categories and directed equality is represented by $\hom$-functors. We present a general elimination principle based on dinaturality for directed equality which very closely resembles the $J$-rule used in Martin-L\"of type theory, and we highlight which syntactical restrictions are needed to interpret this rule in the context of directed equality. We then use these rules to characterize directed equality as a left relative adjoint to a functor between (para)categories of dinatural transformations which contracts together two variables appearing naturally with a single dinatural one, with the relative functor imposing the syntactic restrictions needed. We then argue that the quantifiers of such a directed type theory should be interpreted as ends and coends, which dinaturality allows us to present in adjoint-like correspondences to a weakening functor. Using these rules we give a formal interpretation to Yoneda reductions and (co)end calculus, and we use logical derivations to prove the Fubini rule for quantifier exchange, the adjointness property of Kan extensions via (co)ends, exponential objects of presheaves, and the (co)Yoneda lemma. We show transitivity (composition), congruence (functoriality), and transport (coYoneda) for directed equality by closely following the same approach of Martin-L\"of type theory, with the notable exception of symmetry. We formalize our main theorems in Agda.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Querying First-Order Theories via Countermodels of Finite Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generic framework for establishing the decidability of a wide range of logical entailment problems (briefly called querying), based on the existence of countermodels that are structurally simple, gauged by certain types of width measures (with treewidth and cliquewidth as popular examples). As an important special case of our framework, we identify logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets, warranting decidable entailment for a wide range of homomorphism-closed queries, subsuming a diverse set of practically relevant query languages. As a particularly powerful width measure, we propose to employ Blumensath's partitionwidth, which subsumes various other commonly considered width measures and exhibits highly favorable computational and structural properties. Focusing on the formalism of existential rules as a popular showcase, we explain how finite partitionwidth sets of rules subsume other known abstract decidable classes but - leveraging existing notions of stratification - also cover a wide range of new rulesets. We expose natural limitations for fitting the class of finite unification sets into our picture and suggest several options for remedy.</description>

      <title>Extensional Taylor Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a calculus of extensional resource terms. These are resource terms \`a la Ehrhard-Regnier, but in infinitely eta-long form. The calculus still retains a finite syntax and dynamics: in particular, we prove strong confluence and normalization.
  Then we define an extensional version of Taylor expansion, mapping ordinary lambda-terms to (possibly infinite) linear combinations of extensional resource terms: like in the ordinary case, the dynamics of our resource calculus allows us to simulate the beta-reduction of lambda-terms; the extensional nature of this expansion shows in the fact that we are also able to simulate eta-reduction.
  In a sense, extensional resource terms contain a language of finite approximants of Nakajima trees, much like ordinary resource terms can be seen as a richer version of finite B\"ohm trees. We show that the equivalence induced on lambda-terms by the normalization of extensional Taylor-expansion is nothing but H*, the greatest consistent sensible lambda-theory - which is also the theory induced by Nakajima trees. This characterization provides a new, simple way to exhibit models of H*: it becomes sufficient to model the extensional resource calculus and its dynamics.
  The extensional resource calculus moreover allows us to recover, in an untyped setting, a connection between Taylor expansion and game semantics that was previously limited to the typed setting. Indeed, simply typed, eta-long, beta-normal resource terms are known to be in bijective correspondence with plays in the sense of Hyland-Ong game semantics, up to Melli\`es' homotopy equivalence. Extensional resource terms are the appropriate counterpart of eta-long resource terms in an untyped setting: we spell out the bijection between normal extensional resource terms and isomorphism classes of augmentations (a canonical presentation of plays up to homotopy) in the universal arena.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Model-checking of Discrete-Timed Networks and Symmetric-Broadcast Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the model-checking problem for parameterized discrete-timed systems with arbitrarily many anonymous and identical processes, with and without a distinguished "controller", and communicating via synchronous rendezvous. Our framework extends the seminal work from German and Sistla on untimed systems by adding discrete-time clocks to processes. For the case without a controller, we show that the systems can be efficiently simulated -- and vice versa -- by systems of untimed processes that communicate via rendezvous and symmetric broadcast, which we call "RB-systems". Symmetric broadcast is a novel communication primitive that allows all processes to synchronize at once; however, it does not distinguish between sending and receiving processes. We show that the parameterized model-checking problem for safety specifications is pspace-complete, and for liveness specifications it is decidable in exptime. The latter result is proved using automata theory, rational linear programming, and geometric reasoning for solving certain reachability questions in a new variant of vector addition systems called "vector rendezvous systems". We believe these proof techniques are of independent interest and will be useful in solving related problems. For the case with a controller, we show that the parameterized model-checking problems for RB-systems and systems with asymmetric broadcast as a primitive are inter-reducible. This allows us to prove that for discrete timed-networks with a controller the parameterized model-checking problem is undecidable for liveness specifications. Our work exploits the intimate connection between parameterized discrete-timed systems and systems of processes communicating via broadcast, providing a rare and surprising decidability result for liveness properties of parameterized timed-systems, as well as extend work from untimed systems to timed systems.</description>

      <title>From Width-Based Model Checking to Width-Based Automated Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of parameterized complexity theory, the study of graph width measures has been intimately connected with the development of width-based model checking algorithms for combinatorial properties on graphs. In this work, we introduce a general framework to convert a large class of width-based model-checking algorithms into algorithms that can be used to test the validity of graph-theoretic conjectures on classes of graphs of bounded width. Our framework is modular and can be applied with respect to several well-studied width measures for graphs, including treewidth and cliquewidth.
  As a quantitative application of our framework, we prove analytically that for several long-standing graph-theoretic conjectures, there exists an algorithm that takes a number $k$ as input and correctly determines in time double-exponential in $k^{O(1)}$ whether the conjecture is valid on all graphs of treewidth at most $k$. These upper bounds, which may be regarded as upper-bounds on the size of proofs/disproofs for these conjectures on the class of graphs of treewidth at most $k$, improve significantly on theoretical upper bounds obtained using previously available techniques.</description>
