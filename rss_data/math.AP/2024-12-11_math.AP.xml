      <title>Scattering and Blow-Up in Both Time Directions Above the Ground State for the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we obtain new scattering and blow-up solutions for intercritical focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations (NLS) above the ground state mass-energy threshold. The main focus of this article is the establishment of some solutions with arbitrarily large mass-energy which scatter in both time directions. In particular, large mass-energy which does not arise from the Galilean transformation. We additionally obtain new criteria for blow-up in both time directions, as well as improved sufficient conditions for scattering and blow-up in one time direction.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Convergence and Asymptotic Analysis for a Diffuse Domain Problem with Transmission Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse domain methods (DDMs) have garnered significant attention for approximating solutions to partial differential equations on complex geometries. These methods implicitly represent the geometry by replacing the sharp boundary interface with a diffuse layer of thickness $\varepsilon$, which scales with the minimum grid size. This approach reformulates the original equations on an extended regular domain, incorporating boundary conditions through singular source terms. In this work, we conduct a matched asymptotic analysis of a DDM for a two-sided problem with transmission Robin boundary conditions. Our results show that, in one dimension, the solution of the diffuse domain approximation asymptotically converges to the solution of the original problem, with exactly first-order accuracy in $\varepsilon$. We provide numerical simulations that validate and illustrate the analytical result. Furthermore, for the Neumann boundary condition case, we show that the associated energy functional of the diffuse domain approximation $\Gamma-$convergences to the energy functional of the original problem, and the solution of the diffuse domain approximation strongly converges, up to a subsequence, to the solution of the original problem in $H^1(\Omega)$, as $\varepsilon \to 0$.</description>

      <title>On absence of embedded eigenvalues and stability of BGK waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider space-periodic and inhomogeneous steady states of the one-dimensional electrostatic Vlasov-Poisson system, known as the Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) waves. We prove that there exists a large class of fixed background ion densities and spatial periods, so that the corresponding linearised operator around the associated BGK-equilibria has no embedded eigenvalues inside the essential spectrum. As a consequence we conclude a nonquantitative version of Landau damping around a subclass of such equilibria with monotone dependence on particle energy.
  The BGK equilibria under investigation feature trapped electrons which lead to presence of both elliptic and hyperbolic critical points in the characteristic phase-space diagram. They also feature a small parameter, which roughly speaking governs the size of the trapped zone - also referred to as electron hole. Our argument uses action-angle variables and a careful analysis of the associated period function. To exclude embedded eigenvalues we develop an energy-based approach which deals with resonant interactions between the energy (action)-space and the angle frequencies; their singular structure and summability properties are the key technical challenge. Our approach is robust and applicable to other spectral problems featuring elliptic and hyperbolic critical points.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations with defects leading to stratified problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homogenization of a class of bidimensional stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equations where the Hamiltonian is obtained by perturbing near a half-line of the state space a Hamiltonian that either does not have fast variations with respect to the state variable, or depends on the latter in a periodic manner. We prove that the limiting problem belongs to the class of stratified problems introduced by A. Bressan and Y. Hong and later studied by G. Barles and E. Chasseigne. The related Whitney stratification is made of a submanifold of dimension zero, namely the endpoint of the half-line, a submanifold of dimension one, the open half-line, and the complement of the latter two sets which is a submanifold of dimension two. The limiting problem involves effective Hamiltonians that are associated to the above mentioned three submanifolds and keep track of the perturbation. Another example in which the Hamiltonian is perturbed in a tubular neighborhood of a line is studied.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Solutions to the steady Navier-Stokes Equations in a two-dimensional sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with self-similar solutions of the steady Navier-Stokes system in a two-dimensional sector with the no-slip boundary condition. We give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the angle of the sector and the flux to guarantee the existence of self-similar solutions of a given type. We also investigate the uniqueness and non-uniqueness of flows with a given type, which not only give rigorous justifications for some statements in \cite{Rosenhead40} but also show that some numerical computations in \cite{Rosenhead40} may not be precise. The non-uniqueness result is a new phenomenon for these flows. As a consequence of the classification of self-similar solutions in the half-space, we characterize the leading order term of the steady Navier-Stokes system in an aperture domain when the flux is small. The main approach is to study the ODE system governing self-similar solutions, where the detailed properties of both complete and incomplete elliptic functions have been investigated.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and smoothing effect for spatially homogeneous Landau-Coulomb equation in $H^{-\f12}$ space with polynomial tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the spatially homogeneous Landau-Coulomb equation exhibits global existence and uniqueness around the space $H^{-\f12}_3\cap L^1_{7}\cap L\log L$. Additionally, we furnish several quantitative assessments regarding the smoothing estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces for various initial data configurations. Consequently, we confirm the conjecture that the solution possesses a $C^\infty$ smoothing effect in velocity variable for any positive time, similar to the heat equation, despite the initial data having only a polynomial tail.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Domain Walls for Notched Ferromagnetic Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a simple model of notched ferromagnetic nanowires using tools from calculus of variations and critical point theory. Specifically, we focus on the case of a single unimodal notch and establish the existence and uniqueness of the critical point of the energy. This is achieved through a lifting argument, which reduces the problem to a generalized Sturm-Liouville equation. Uniqueness is demonstrated via a Mountain-Pass argument, where the assumption of two distinct critical points leads to a contradiction. Additionally, we show that the solution corresponds to a system of magnetic spins characterized by a single domain wall localized in the vicinity of the notch. We further analyze the asymptotic decay of the solution at infinity and explore the symmetric case using rearrangement techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quasi-dissipative evolution equations with the moment-SOS hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there is no relaxation gap between a quasi-dissipative nonlinear evolution equation in a Hilbert space and its linear Liouville equation reformulation on probability measures. In other words, strong and generalized solutions of such equations are unique in the class of measure-valued solutions. As a major consequence, non-convex numerical optimization over these non-linear partial differential equations can be carried out with the infinite-dimensional moment-SOS hierarchy with global convergence guarantees. This covers in particular all reaction-diffusion equations with polynomial nonlinearity.</description>

We also provide an alternate proof of a fractional Hardy's inequality in $\mathbb{H}^n$ established in an earlier work.</description>

      <title>Global existence and scattering of small data smooth solutions to quasilinear wave systems on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}$, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper [Fei Hou, Fei Tao, Huicheng Yin, Global existence and scattering of small data smooth solutions to a class of quasilinear wave systems on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}$, Preprint (2024), arXiv:2405.03242], for the $Q_0$-type quadratic nonlinearities, we have shown the global well-posedness and scattering properties of small data smooth solutions to the quasilinear wave systems on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}$. In this paper, we start to solve the global existence problem for the remaining $Q_{\alpha\beta}$-type nonlinearities. By combining these results, we have established the global well-posedness of small solutions on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}$ for the general 3-D quadratically quasilinear wave systems when the related 2-D null conditions are fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Westervelt-based modeling of ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear multiphysics model motivated by ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery. The acoustic pressure field is modeled by Westervelt's quasilinear wave equation to adequately capture the nonlinear effects in ultrasound propagation. The nonlocal attenuation characteristic for soft biological media is modeled by acoustic damping of the time-fractional type. Additionally, acoustic medium parameters are allowed to depend on the temperature of the medium. The wave equation is coupled to the nonlinear Pennes heat equation with a pressure-dependent source to account for ultrasound waves heating up the tissue. Finally, the drug concentration is obtained as the solution to an advection-diffusion equation with a pressure-dependent velocity. Toward gaining a rigorous understanding of this system, we set up a fixed-point argument in the analysis combined with devising energy estimates that can accommodate the time-fractional damping. The energy arguments are, in part, carried out by employing time-weighted test functions to reduce the regularity assumptions on the initial temperature. The analysis reveals that different smoothness of the initial pressure, temperature, and concentration fields is needed as well as smallness of the pressure-temperature data in order to ensure non-degeneracy of the system and establish well-posedness. Our theoretical considerations are complemented by a numerical investigation of the system under more realistic boundary conditions. The numerical experiments, performed in different computational scenarios, underline the importance of considering nonlinear effects when modeling ultrasound-targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Admissible Values of the Travelling Wave Speed in Asymmetrically Supported Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the admissible values of the wave speed $c$ for which the beam equation with jumping nonlinearity possesses a travelling wave solution. In contrast to previously studied problems modelling suspension bridges, the presence of the term with negative part of the solution in the equation results in restrictions of $c$. In this paper, we provide the maximal wave speed range for which the existence of the travelling wave solution can be proved using the Mountain Pass Theorem. We also introduce its close connection with related Dirichlet problems and their Fu\v{c}\'{i}k spectra. Moreover, we present several analytical approximations of the main existence result with assumptions that are easy to verify. Finally, we formulate a conjecture that the infimum of the admissible wave speed range can be described by the Fu\v{c}\'{i}k spectrum of a simple periodic problem.</description>

      <title>Existence results for Toda systems with sign-changing prescribed functions: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a compact Riemann surface with area $1$. We investigate the Toda system \begin{align} \begin{cases} -\Delta u_1 = 2\rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1) - \rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1),\\ -\Delta u_2 = 2\rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1) - \rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1), \end{cases} \end{align} on $(M, g)$ where $\rho_1, \rho_2 \in (0,4\pi]$, and $h_1$ and $h_2$ are two smooth functions on $M$.When some $\rho_i$ equals $4\pi$, the Toda system becomes critical with respect to the Moser-Trudinger inequality for it, making the existence problem significantly more challenging. In their seminal article (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 59 (2006), no. 4, 526--558), Jost, Lin, and Wang established sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions the Toda system when $\rho_1=4\pi$, $\rho_2 \in (0,4\pi)$ or $\rho_1=\rho_2=4\pi$, assuming that $h_1$ and $h_2$ are both positive. In our previous paper we extended these results to allow $h_1$ and $h_2$ to change signs in the case $\rho_1=4\pi$, $\rho_2 \in (0,4\pi)$. In this paper we further extend the study to prove that Jost-Lin-Wang's sufficient conditions remain valid even when $h_1$ and $h_2$ can change signs and $\rho_1=\rho_2=4\pi$. Our proof relies on an improved version of the Moser-Trudinger inequality for the Toda system, along with edicated analyses similar to Brezis-Merle type and the use of Pohozaev identities.</description>

      <title>Bounded solutions of degenerate elliptic equations with an Orlicz-gain Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the boundedness and exponential integrability of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the degenerate elliptic equation % \[ -v^{-1}\mathrm{Div}(|\sqrt{Q}\nabla u|^{p-2}Q\nabla u)=f|f|^{p-2}, \quad 1&lt;p&lt;\infty, \] % assuming that there is a Sobolev inequality of the form % \[ \|\varphi\|_{L^N(v,\Omega)}\leq S_N\|\sqrt{Q} \varphi\|_{L^p(\Omega)}, \] % where $N$ is a power function of the form $N(t)=t^{\sigma p}$, $\sigma\geq 1$, or a Young function of the form $N(t)=t^p\log(e+t)^\sigma$, $\sigma&gt;1$. In our results we study the interplay between the Sobolev inequality and the regularity assumptions needed on $f$ to prove that the solution is bounded or is exponentially integrable. Our results generalize those previously proved in previous work by the authors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an extremal problem associated with the solution to a boundary value problem. Our main focus is on establishing a variational formula for a functional related to the $\mathbf{p}$-harmonic measure, from which a new measure is derived. This further motivates us to study the Minkowski problem for this new measure. As a main result, we prove the existence of solutions to the $L_q$ Minkowski problem associated with the $\mathbf{p}$-harmonic measure for $0&lt;q&lt;1$ and $1&lt;\mathbf{p}\ne n+1$.</description>

      <title>Solving the Poisson Equation with Dirichlet data by shallow ReLU$^\alpha$-networks: A regularity and approximation perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several classes of neural PDE solvers (Deep Ritz, PINNs, DeepONets), the ability to approximate the solution or solution operator to a partial differential equation (PDE) hinges on the abilitiy of a neural network to approximate the solution in the spatial variables. We analyze the capacity of neural networks to approximate solutions to an elliptic PDE assuming that the boundary condition can be approximated efficiently. Our focus is on the Laplace operator with Dirichlet boundary condition on a half space and on neural networks with a single hidden layer and an activation function that is a power of the popular ReLU activation function.</description>

      <title>Smoluchowski Coagulation Equation with a Flux of Dust Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a time-dependent solution to the Smoluchowski coagulation equation with a constant flux of dust particles entering through the boundary at zero. The dust is instantaneously converted into particles and flux solutions have linearly increasing mass. The construction is made for a general class of non-gelling coagulation kernels for which stationary solutions, so-called constant flux solutions, exist. The proof relies on several limiting procedures on a family of solutions of equations with sources supported on ever smaller sizes. In particular, uniform estimates on the fluxes of these solutions are derived in order to control the singularity produced by the flux at zero. We further show that, up to the multiplication by a scalar, flux solutions averaged in size and integrated in time, are bounded from above by the explicit solution, $x^{-\frac{\gamma+3}{2}}$, of the constant flux equation, where $\gamma$ is the homogeneity of the bounds of the coagulation rate kernel. Flux solutions are expected to converge to a constant flux solution in the large time limit. We show that this is indeed true in the particular case of the constant kernel with zero initial data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of vorticity moments in shell models of turbulence: A comparison with the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shell models allow much greater scale separations than those presently achievable with direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Consequently, they are an invaluable tool for testing new concepts and ideas in the theory of fully developed turbulence. They also successfully display energy cascades and intermittency in homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows. Moreover, they are also of great interest to mathematical analysts because, while retaining some of the key features of the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations, they are much more tractable. A comparison of the mathematical properties of shell models and of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is therefore essential in understanding the correspondence between the two systems. Here we focus on the temporal evolution of the moments, or $L^{2m}$-norms, of the vorticity. Specifically, differential inequalities for the moments of the vorticity in shell models are derived. The contribution of the nonlinear term turns out to be much weaker than its equivalent for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Consequently, pointwise-in-time estimates are shown to exist for the vorticity moments for shell models of any order. This result is also recovered via a high-low frequency slaving argument that highlights the scaling relations between vorticity moments of different orders. Finally, it is shown that the estimates for shell models formally correspond to those for the Navier-Stokes equations 'on a point'.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin methods for the complete stochastic Euler equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, stochastic effects have become increasingly relevant for describing fluid behaviour, particularly in the context of turbulence. The most important model for inviscid fluids in computational fluid dynamics are the Euler equations of gas dynamics which we focus on in this paper. To take stochastic effects into account, we incorporate a stochastic forcing term in the momentum equation of the Euler system. To solve the extended system, we apply an entropy dissipative discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method including the Finite Volume setting, adjust it to the stochastic Euler equations and analyze its convergence properties. Our analysis is grounded in the concept of dissipative martingale solutions, as recently introduced by Moyo (J. Diff. Equ. 365, 408-464, 2023). Assuming no vacuum formation and bounded total energy, we proof that our scheme converges in law to a dissipative martingale solution. During the lifespan of a pathwise strong solution, we achieve convergence of at least order 1/2, measured by the expected $L^1$ norm of the relative energy. The results built a counterpart of corresponding results in the deterministic case. In numerical simulations, we show the robustness of our scheme, visualise different stochastic realizations and analyze our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>An H-theorem for a conditional McKean-Vlasov process related to interacting diffusions on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of the $\kappa$-Markov local-field equation ($\kappa$-MLFE), which is a conditional McKean-Vlasov equation associated with interacting diffusions on the $\kappa$-regular tree. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients, we prove well-posedness of the $\kappa$-MLFE. We also establish an H-theorem by identifying an energy functional, referred to as the sparse free energy, whose derivative along the measure flow of the $\kappa$-MLFE is given by a nonnegative functional that can be viewed as a modified Fisher information. Moreover, we show that the zeros of the latter functional coincide with the set of stationary distributions of the $\kappa$-MLFE and are also marginals of splitting Gibbs measures on the $\kappa$-regular tree. Furthermore, we show that for a natural class of initial conditions, the corresponding measure flow converges to one of the stationary distributions, thus demonstrating that the sparse free energy acts as a global Lyapunov function. Under mild additional conditions, in the case $\kappa = 2$ we prove that the sparse free energy arises naturally as the renormalized limit of certain relative entropies. We exploit this characterization to prove a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and establish an exponential rate of convergence of the $2$-MLFE measure flow to its unique stationary distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concerns the results obtained in [Cabre, Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra, Acta Math. 224 (2020)], which established the H\"older regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations in the optimal range of dimensions $n \leq 9$. For expository purposes, we provide self-contained proofs of all results. They only involve basic Analysis tools and can be understood by mathematicians who are not experts in PDEs.
  Two of the results in the 2020 article relied on compactness arguments. Here we present, instead, quantitative proofs from the more recent paper [Cabre, to appear in Amer. J. Math, arXiv:2211.13033]. They allow to quantify the H\"older regularity exponent and simplify significantly the treatment of boundary regularity.
  We also comment on similar progress and open problems for related equations.</description>

Abstract: We prove microlocal estimates with normally hyperbolic trapping. We use a new type of symbol class which is constructed by blowing up the intersection of the unstable manifold and the fiber infinity. For scalar wave equations on Kerr(-de Sitter) spacetimes, the extra loss of the microlocal estimates compared with the standard propagation of singularities is arbitrarily small.</description>

      <title>Estimates controlling a function by only its radial derivative and applications to stable solutions of elliptic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13033v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish two new estimates which control a function (after subtracting its average) in $L^1$ by only the $L^1$ norm of its radial derivative. While the interior estimate holds for all superharmonic functions, the boundary version is much more delicate. It requires the function to be a stable solution of a semilinear elliptic equation with a nonnegative, nondecreasing, and convex nonlinearity. As an application, our estimates provide quantitative proofs of two results established by contradiction-compactness arguments in [Cabre, Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra, Acta Math. 224 (2020)]. We recall that this work proved the H\"older regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations in the optimal range of dimensions $n \leq 9$.</description>

      <title>An operator-asymptotic approach to periodic homogenization for equations of linearized elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an operator-asymptotic approach to the problem of homogenization of periodic composite media in the setting of three-dimensional linearized elasticity. This is based on a uniform approximation with respect to the inverse wavelength $|\chi|$ for the solution to the resolvent problem when written as a superposition of elementary plane waves with wave vector (``quasimomentum") $\chi$. We develop an asymptotic procedure in powers of $|\chi|$, combined with a new uniform version of the classical Korn inequality. As a consequence, we obtain $L^2\to L^2$, $L^2\to H^1$, and higher-order $L^2\to L^2$ norm-resolvent estimates in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The $L^2 \to H^1$ and higher-order $L^2 \to L^2$ correctors emerge naturally from the asymptotic procedure, and the former is shown to coincide with the classical formulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of Vlasov-type kinetic flocking models featuring nonlinear velocity alignment. Our primary objective is to rigorously derive the hydrodynamic limit leading to the compressible Euler system with nonlinear alignment. This study builds upon the work by Figalli and Kang [Anal. PDE, 12(3), 843-866, 2018], which addressed the scenario of linear velocity alignment using the relative entropy method. The introduction of nonlinearity gives rise to an additional discrepancy in the alignment term during the limiting process. To effectively handle this discrepancy, we employ the monokinetic ansatz in conjunction with the relative entropy approach. Furthermore, our analysis reveals distinct nonlinear alignment behaviors between the kinetic and hydrodynamic systems, particularly evident in the isothermal regime.</description>

      <title>Entropy on the path space and application to singular diffusions and mean-field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we intend to present a unified treatment of a variety of singular interacting particle systems and their McKean-Vlasov limits. This unified approach is based on the use of the relative entropy on the path space in the spirit of our previous works together with C. L{\'e}onard. We show how it can be used to derive existence and uniqueness for some singular diffusions, in particular linear mean field stochastic particle systems and non linear SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, including $\mathbf L^p-\mathbf L^q$ models, the 2D vortex model associated to the 2D Navier-Stokes equation, sub-Coulombic interactions models or the Patlak-Keller-Segel model.  We also show the convergence and propagation of chaos as the number of particles grows to infinity. This is (mainly) obtained at the process level, not only at the Liouville equation (marginals flow) level. The paper thus contains new proofs and extensions of known results, as well as new results.The main results are given at the end of the Introduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport has proven to have numerous applications in data science. In some of those, differentiating the transport map with respect to the densities in the Fr\'echet sense is required. In this work, we prove that for compact, $\mathcal{C}^{2,\alpha}$ uniformly convex sets $\Omega, \Omega' \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a $\mathcal{C}^1$ curve of densities $\{p_t\} \subset \mathcal{C}^{1,\gamma}(\Omega')$ that are uniformly bounded away from zero and infinity, the curve of transport maps $\{\nabla \phi_t\} \subset \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\Omega)$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\gamma\leq 1$, pushing the reference measure $Q$ on $\Omega$ forward to $P_t$ (where $P_t$ admits density $p_t$ and $Q$ is sufficiently regular), is also $\mathcal{C}^1$. The proof is based on applying the implicit function theorem to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with natural boundary conditions. To achieve this, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the {\it linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation}, an elliptic partial differential equation characterized by strictly oblique boundary conditions and a null zero-order term. As a consequence, our result establishes the regularity of the transport-based quantile regressor defined in (Carlier et al. Ann. Statist. {\bf 40} (2017) 1165--1192) and (del Barrio et al. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. (2024) 1--43) with respect to the covariates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equations in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ $(d\in\{2,3\})$, subject to a nonlocal kinetic rate dependent dynamic boundary condition. This diffuse interface model describes phase separation processes with possible long-range interactions both within the bulk material and on its boundary. The kinetic rate $1/L$, with $L\in[0,+\infty]$, distinguishes different types of bulk-boundary interactions. For the initial boundary value problem endowed with general singular potentials, including the physically relevant logarithmic potential, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions when the bulk and boundary chemical potentials are coupled through a Robin-type boundary condition, i.e., $L\in(0,+\infty)$. The proof of existence is based on a Yosida approximation of singular potentials and a suitable Faedo-Galerkin scheme. Subsequently, we investigate asymptotic limits as the kinetic rate approaches zero or infinity, which yield weak well-posedness for the limiting cases $L=+\infty$ and $L=0$, respectively. Under appropriate assumptions on the interaction kernels, we derive explicit convergence rates for the Yosida approximation as $\varepsilon\to0$ and for the asymptotic limits as $L\to0$ or $L\to+\infty$. Finally, we demonstrate that every global weak solution exhibits a propagation of regularity over time and when $L\in(0,+\infty]$, we establish the instantaneous strict separation property by means of a suitable De Giorgi's iteration scheme.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the existence of multiple positive solutions for the following Dirichlet boundary value problem: \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned}
  -\Delta_p u + (-\Delta_p)^s u = \lambda \frac{f(u)}{u^{\beta}}\ \text{in} \ \Omega\newline
  u &gt;0\ \text{in} \ \Omega,\ u =0\ \text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is an arbitrary bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with smooth boundary, $0\leq \beta&lt;1$ and $f$ is a non-decreasing $C^1$-function which is $p$-sublinear at infinity and satisfies $f(0)&gt;0$. By employing the method of sub- and supersolutions, we establish the existence of a positive solution for every $\lambda&gt;0$ and that of two positive solutions for a certain range of the parameter $\lambda$. In the non-singular case (i.e. when $\beta=0$) and in the linear case with singularity (i.e. when $p=2$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$), we further apply Amann's fixed point theorem to show that the problem admits at least three positive solutions within this range of $\lambda$. The mixed local-nonlocal nature of the operator and the non-linearity pose challenges in constructing sub- and supersolutions, however, these are effectively addressed through the operator's homogeneity.</description>

Abstract: We study the anisotropic, incompressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system with variable density in a bounded smooth domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. This work extends previous studies on the isotropic case by incorporating anisotropic surface energy, represented by $\mathfrak{F}= \int_{\Omega} \frac{\epsilon}{2}\, \Gamma^2(\nabla \phi) $. The thermodynamic consistency of this system, as well as its modeling background and physical motivation, has been established in [3,5,7]. Using a Galerkin approximation scheme, we prove the existence of global weak solutions in both two and three dimensions $(d=2,3)$. A crucial element in extending the existence of approximate solutions from local to global lies in the application of Bihari's inequality and a fixed-point argument.</description>

      <title>Differential algebra of polytopes and inversion formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the differential algebra of polytopes to explain the known remarkable relation of the combinatorics of the associahedra and permutohedra with the universal compositional and multiplicative inversion formulas for the formal power series. This approach allows to single out the associahedra and permutohedra among all graph-associahedra and emphasizes the significance of the differential equations for special sequences of simple polytopes derived earlier by one of the authors. We discuss also the link with the geometry of Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces $\bar M_{0,n}$ and the interpretation of the combinatorics of cyclohedra in relation with the classical Fa\`a di Bruno's formula.</description>
