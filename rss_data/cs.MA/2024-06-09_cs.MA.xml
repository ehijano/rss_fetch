      <title>Software Engineering for Collective Cyber-Physical Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's distributed and pervasive computing addresses large-scale cyber-physical ecosystems, characterised by dense and large networks of devices capable of computation, communication and interaction with the environment and people. While most research focusses on treating these systems as "composites" (i.e., heterogeneous functional complexes), recent developments in fields such as self-organising systems and swarm robotics have opened up a complementary perspective: treating systems as "collectives" (i.e., uniform, collaborative, and self-organising groups of entities). This article explores the motivations, state of the art, and implications of this "collective computing paradigm" in software engineering, discusses its peculiar challenges, and outlines a path for future research, touching on aspects such as macroprogramming, collective intelligence, self-adaptive middleware, learning, synthesis, and experimentation of collective behaviour.</description>

      <title>FedLLM-Bench: Realistic Benchmarks for Federated Learning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has enabled multiple parties to collaboratively train large language models without directly sharing their data (FedLLM). Following this training paradigm, the community has put massive efforts from diverse aspects including framework, performance, and privacy. However, an unpleasant fact is that there are currently no realistic datasets and benchmarks for FedLLM and previous works all rely on artificially constructed datasets, failing to capture properties in real-world scenarios. Addressing this, we propose FedLLM-Bench, which involves 8 training methods, 4 training datasets, and 6 evaluation metrics, to offer a comprehensive testbed for the FedLLM community. FedLLM-Bench encompasses three datasets (e.g., user-annotated multilingual dataset) for federated instruction tuning and one dataset (e.g., user-annotated preference dataset) for federated preference alignment, whose scale of client number ranges from 38 to 747. Our datasets incorporate several representative diversities: language, quality, quantity, instruction, length, embedding, and preference, capturing properties in real-world scenarios. Based on FedLLM-Bench, we conduct experiments on all datasets to benchmark existing FL methods and provide empirical insights (e.g., multilingual collaboration). We believe that our FedLLM-Bench can benefit the FedLLM community by reducing required efforts, providing a practical testbed, and promoting fair comparisons. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/rui-ye/FedLLM-Bench.</description>

      <title>Online Frequency Scheduling by Learning Parallel Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio Resource Management is a challenging topic in future 6G networks where novel applications create strong competition among the users for the available resources. In this work we consider the frequency scheduling problem in a multi-user MIMO system. Frequency resources need to be assigned to a set of users while allowing for concurrent transmissions in the same sub-band. Traditional methods are insufficient to cope with all the involved constraints and uncertainties, whereas reinforcement learning can directly learn near-optimal solutions for such complex environments. However, the scheduling problem has an enormous action space accounting for all the combinations of users and sub-bands, so out-of-the-box algorithms cannot be used directly. In this work, we propose a scheduler based on action-branching over sub-bands, which is a deep Q-learning architecture with parallel decision capabilities. The sub-bands learn correlated but local decision policies and altogether they optimize a global reward. To improve the scaling of the architecture with the number of sub-bands, we propose variations (Unibranch, Graph Neural Network-based) that reduce the number of parameters to learn. The parallel decision making of the proposed architecture allows to meet short inference time requirements in real systems. Furthermore, the deep Q-learning approach permits online fine-tuning after deployment to bridge the sim-to-real gap. The proposed architectures are evaluated against relevant baselines from the literature showing competitive performance and possibilities of online adaptation to evolving environments.</description>

      <title>Massively Multiagent Minigames for Training Generalist Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Meta MMO, a collection of many-agent minigames for use as a reinforcement learning benchmark. Meta MMO is built on top of Neural MMO, a massively multiagent environment that has been the subject of two previous NeurIPS competitions. Our work expands Neural MMO with several computationally efficient minigames. We explore generalization across Meta MMO by learning to play several minigames with a single set of weights. We release the environment, baselines, and training code under the MIT license. We hope that Meta MMO will spur additional progress on Neural MMO and, more generally, will serve as a useful benchmark for many-agent generalization.</description>

      <title>CompeteAI: Understanding the Competition Dynamics in Large Language Model-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used as agents to complete different tasks, such as personal assistance or event planning. While most of the work has focused on cooperation and collaboration between agents, little work explores competition, another important mechanism that promotes the development of society and economy. In this paper, we seek to examine the competition dynamics in LLM-based agents. We first propose a general framework for studying the competition between agents. Then, we implement a practical competitive environment using GPT-4 to simulate a virtual town with two types of agents, restaurant agents and customer agents. Specifically, the restaurant agents compete with each other to attract more customers, where competition encourages them to transform, such as cultivating new operating strategies. Simulation experiments reveal several interesting findings at the micro and macro levels, which align well with existing market and sociological theories. We hope that the framework and environment can be a promising testbed to study competition that fosters understanding of society.

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>CoViS-Net: A Cooperative Visual Spatial Foundation Model for Multi-Robot Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robot operation in unstructured environments is often underpinned by spatial understanding through vision. Systems composed of multiple concurrently operating robots additionally require access to frequent, accurate and reliable pose estimates. Classical vision-based methods to regress relative pose are commonly computationally expensive (precluding real-time applications), and often lack data-derived priors for resolving ambiguities. In this work, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data, enabling pose estimation as well as general spatial comprehension. Our model is fully decentralized, platform-agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing networking infrastructure. CoViS-Net provides relative pose estimates and a local bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation, even without camera overlap between robots, and can predict BEV representations of unseen regions. We demonstrate its use in a multi-robot formation control task across various real-world settings. We provide supplementary material online and will open source our trained model in due course. https://sites.google.com/view/covis-net</description>

      <title>Dynamic Deep Factor Graph for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel value decomposition algorithm, termed \textit{Dynamic Deep Factor Graphs} (DDFG). Unlike traditional coordination graphs, DDFG leverages factor graphs to articulate the decomposition of value functions, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability to complex value function structures. Central to DDFG is a graph structure generation policy that innovatively generates factor graph structures on-the-fly, effectively addressing the dynamic collaboration requirements among agents. DDFG strikes an optimal balance between the computational overhead associated with aggregating value functions and the performance degradation inherent in their complete decomposition. Through the application of the max-sum algorithm, DDFG efficiently identifies optimal policies. We empirically validate DDFG's efficacy in complex scenarios, including higher-order predator-prey tasks and the StarCraft II Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC), thus underscoring its capability to surmount the limitations faced by existing value decomposition algorithms. DDFG emerges as a robust solution for MARL challenges that demand nuanced understanding and facilitation of dynamic agent collaboration. The implementation of DDFG is made publicly accessible, with the source code available at \url{https://github.com/SICC-Group/DDFG}.</description>
