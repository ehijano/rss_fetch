      <title>The Topological Equivalence Principle: On Decoupling TFTs from Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological field theories (TFTs) play an important role in characterizing the deep infrared (IR) of many quantum systems with a mass gap, as well as the global symmetries of quantum field theories (QFTs) decoupled from gravity. In gravitational asymptotically AdS spacetimes, TFT sectors which are putatively decoupled from local metric data are nevertheless non-perturbatively sensitive to Newton's constant via a sum over topologically distinct saddle point configurations. Tracking the fate of this non-decoupling in the boundary dual, we argue that in spite of appearances, this dependence on Newton's constant extends to local metric fluctuations. Said differently, TFTs are in the Swampland. In tandem with earlier results on the absence of global symmetries in theories with subregion-subregion duality, this also establishes that topological operators of boundary systems with a gravity dual are always non-topological in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Superball of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I solve the equations of the low-energy limit of string theory to obtain a solution corresponding to a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings. This ``Superball of Strings'' is a static, spherically symmetric ``fuzzball'' of BPS strings with a size set by a random walk scaling. The solution can be embedded in string theory in a significant part of parameter space. While the solution does not constitute a Lorentzian interpretation for a Euclidean, horizonless solution by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, a few connections are noted. A singular extremal black hole and the Superball of Strings exist as Supergravity solutions with the same asymptotic boundary conditions; however, I argue that the latter describes generic BPS microstates.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Description of Critical Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions occur through the nucleation of critical bubbles of the stable phase within the metastable phase. Using holography, we present a fully microscopic description of these bubbles in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory at finite temperature. In the gravitational dual, these bubbles correspond to static, inhomogeneous and unstable black-brane solutions with a localized deformation on the horizon. We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement. However, when the effective action is constrained only by the equation of state and dimensional analysis, significant discrepancies emerge. These discrepancies can be resolved if an additional constraint related to the surface tension is imposed.</description>

      <title>Probing the Chaos to Integrability Transition in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how a thermodynamical first-order phase transition affects the dynamical chaotic behaviour of a given model. To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model.</description>

      <title>The Entire Four-Graviton EFT from the Duality Between Color and Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) double-copy construction reveals a fundamental structural connection between gauge and gravity theories. At its core, the BCJ double copy is directly due to a duality between the algebraic relations of a color root and those of a kinematic root. We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D &gt;6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars. Explicit machine-readable expressions for the complete basis of gauge-theory numerators and fundamental gravitational building blocks are provided in the ancillary files. This establishes that all possible four-point gravitational interactions can be factorized into products of gauge-theory building blocks governed by this universal notion of color-kinematics duality.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Path Integrals and Jackiw-Teitelboim wormholes with imaginary scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral was recently used to argue that standard Euclidean axion wormholes do not dominate computations of connected AdS/CFT partition functions. We now apply similar methods to study the seemingly-analogous Jackiw-Teitelboim wormholes constructed by Garcia-Garcia and Godet using Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an imaginary-valued minimally-coupled massless scalar field. However, this time we find that these wormholes do dominate our path integral for the relevant connected partition function. This supports the suggestion by Garcia-Garcia and Godet that contributions from such wormholes parallel the physics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at complex couplings. The result also illustrates the sensitivity of wormhole contributions to details of the relevant physics.</description>

      <title>Analytic approach to boundary integrability with application to mixed-flux $AdS_3 \times S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary integrability provides rare analytic control over field theories in the presence of an interface, from quantum impurity problems to open string dynamics. We develop an analytic framework for integrable boundaries in two-dimensional sigma-models that determines admissible reflection maps directly from the meromorphic Lax connection. Applying it to open strings on $AdS_3\times S^3$ with mixed NSNS and RR flux, we find two branches of integrable boundary conditions. One branch admits D-branes wrapping twisted conjugacy classes on $SU(1,1)\times SU(2)$, with the mixed-flux deformation encoded entirely into dynamical boundary data. At the exactly solvable WZW point these coincide with the conformal D-branes, providing a natural link to conformal perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial properties of holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A holographic entropy inequality (HEI) is a linear inequality obeyed by Ryu-Takayanagi holographic entanglement entropies, or equivalently by the minimum cut function on weighted graphs. We establish a new combinatorial framework for studying HEIs, and use it to prove several properties they share, including two majorization-related properties as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for an inequality to be an HEI. We thereby resolve all the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823], proving two of them and disproving the other two. In particular, we show that the null reduction of any superbalanced HEI passes the majorization test defined in [arXiv:2508.21823], thereby providing strong new evidence that all HEIs are obeyed in time-dependent holographic states.</description>

      <title>Holographic entropy inequalities pass the majorization test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantities computed by minimal cuts, such as entanglement entropies achievable by the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal in the AdS/CFT correspondence, are constrained by linear inequalities. We prove a previously conjectured property of all such constraints: Any $k$ systems on the "greater-than" side of the inequality are subsumed in some $k$ systems on its "less-than" side (accounting for multiplicity). This finding adds evidence that the same inequalities also constrain the entropies under time-dependent conditions because it preempts a large class of potential counterexamples. We prove several other properties of holographic entropy inequalities and comment on their relation to quantum erasure correction and the Renormalization Group.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of $\text{T}\bar{\text{T}}$ and root-$\text{T}\bar{\text{T}}$ deformations on reflected and entanglement entropy in the context of both pure and mixed state entanglement measures. Utilizing a mixed boundary condition framework, we analyze how these deformations modify entanglement structures and explore their implications in three-dimensional AdS space. Our results provide insights into the interplay between solvable irrelevant deformations and quantum information-theoretic quantities, shedding light on the entanglement structure of deformed theories.</description>

      <title>The recipe for the degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of counting the degrees of freedom in theoretical models, with an emphasis on theories of fields and gravity. Among the possible approaches, the Hamiltonian formulation remains one of the most systematic and robust tools. However, it can easily become long and technically involved. In this work, we present a broadly applicable recipe to find the degrees of freedom directly, based on the Lagrangian formulation. We compare it to the standard approaches, highlight the challenges that may arise in the latter, and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to transparent insights about the dynamical nature of theory in a quick, simple, and straight-forward way.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular Cosmologies in Presence of String Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the braneworld scenario, we introduce a uniformly distributed cloud of infinitely long strings in the five dimensional AdS bulk spacetime. The end points of the strings are attached to the brane and becomes the source of the four dimensional matter on the brane, while the body of the strings hang onto the radial direction of the bulk and act as the gluonic field on the brane. The presence of matter in the brane induces a nonsingular cosmological evolution for the scale factor of the brane world under certain conditions of mass and cosmological parameters. However, the nonsingular nature is unstable since the bounce occurs inside the Cauchy horizon. Further, we consider the shellworld or the dark bubble scenario for the same bulk spacetime. It shows stable nonsingular cosmological nature of the bubble universe under certain conditions on the bulk and bubble parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik operators can be first analyzed in the limit of $q\longrightarrow 1$. Then, the polynomial eigenfunctions form a simple set originating from the symmetric ground state of non-vanishing degree and excitations over it, described by non-symmetric polynomials of higher degrees and enumerated by weak compositions. This pattern is inherited by the full spectrum at $q\neq 1$, which can be considered as a deformation. The whole story looks like a typical NP problem: the Cherednik equations are difficult to solve, but easy to check the solution once it is somehow found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the first-order Einstein-Cartan (EC) action in 2+1 dimensions, including a cosmological term and its supersymmetric extension. In this setting the spin connection can be expressed as an axial vector, yielding an action that is bilinear in the quantum fields and allows quantization without background fields. We identify the complete set of first-class constraints and derive the associated gauge transformations, which differ from the standard diffeomorphism and local Lorentz invariances. Using the closed gauge algebra, we construct the Faddeev-Popov-Nielsen path integral and show how a Lagrange multiplier field can be introduced to remove higher-loop contributions while preserving unitarity and gauge invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft current algebras capture the infrared structure of scattering in asymptotically flat spacetimes, but an analogous algebraic description of finite-energy dynamics has been missing. We uncover an infinite-dimensional hard current algebra that encodes finite-energy contributions to scattering and implies novel Ward identities. The soft current algebras are not independent but arise naturally from the hard ones. This provides a unified algebraic framework underlying quantum theory in flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>The Static Heavy Quark-Antiquark Potential within String Theory in Arbitrary Stationary Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a static open string in a general stationary spacetime, which can represent a heavy quark-antiquark pair within the holographic framework or effective theory. We establish that for a simple U-shaped string with only radial dependence on the space string coordinate, $x_r'(\sigma) \neq 0$, the string is generally not symmetric about its turning point, and the symmetry restores only for backgrounds with $h_{pr} = G_{00} G_{pr} - G_{0p} G_{0r} = 0$. Consequently, such asymmetric strings directly probe a possibility of the parity violation in the quark-antiquark interaction. Nevertheless, we identify a wide family of metrics for which the symmetry is preserved, enabling a direct isolation of the linear-in-distance term in the static interquark potential for simple symmetric string configurations, even in non-diagonal backgrounds. Applying the holographic framework, we further study the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma. We show that the distance between quarks decreases, the static potential between them increases, and the deconfinement phase transition temperature, $T_{\rm dec} = (\pi/3) T_H = a_c/6$, increases with an acceleration. However, we observe that an acceleration-scaled potential as a function of the acceleration-scaled distance does not depend on the certain value of the acceleration This result, reflecting the scale invariance and self-similarity of the holographic setup, can be also obtained in the dimensionless metric after scaling of the coordinates onto the acceleration, $\tilde{x}_i = a_c x_i$, for which one obtains an universal value of the phase transition temperature, $\tilde{T}_{\rm dec} = (\pi/3) \tilde{T}_H = 1/6$.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators in Warped Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Energy Correlators as probes of strongly-coupled nearly-conformal field theories within their holographically dual descriptions, focusing on the important features that appear in realistic theories going beyond the standard model. In particular, we study warped geometries which asymptote to $\text{AdS}_5$, as well as IR-truncations dual to a 4D gap. Our correlators are computed by in-in type Witten perturbative diagrams, corresponding to a large-N expansion of the strong dynamics. We describe how this sets the stage for phenomenological applications for collider searches beyond the standard model as well as for new theoretical explorations in Lorentzian holography.</description>

      <title>Irregular higher-spin generating equations and chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complementary approach to the standard Vasiliev framework for nonlinear higher-spin interactions in four dimensions, aimed at identifying their minimally nonlocal form. Our proposal introduces a generating system for higher-spin vertices at the level of classical equations, which we refer to as irregular, in contrast to the regular case described by Vasiliev. This system extends the recently proposed equations for (anti)holomorphic interactions by incorporating the mixed sector. Its perturbative series encompasses the entire (anti)holomorphic sector in the leading order, with vertices related to powers of the complex parity-breaking parameter $\eta$ or $\bar\eta$. The subsequent corrections facilitate the mixing of the two sectors, with vertices carrying mixed powers of $\eta$ and $\bar\eta$. The consistency relies on the nonlinear algebraic constraint, which is shown to be satisfied at least in the quadratic and cubic approximations. As a result, the previously discussed (anti)holomorphic interactions in the literature can be systematically extended to generate vertices of the form $\eta^N \bar\eta^k$ and their conjugate, at least for $k \leq 2$ and any $N$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also identify the new higher-spin structure dualities.</description>

      <title>Background cancellation for frequency-selective quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in quantum sensing is the detection of weak time dependent signals, particularly those that arise as specific frequency perturbations over a background field. Conventional methods usually demand complex dynamical control of the quantum sensor and heavy classical post-processing. We propose a quantum sensor that leverages time independent interactions and entanglement to function as a passive, tunable, thresholded frequency filter. By encoding the frequency selectivity and thresholding behavior directly into the dynamics, the sensor is responsive only to a target frequency of choice whose amplitude is above a threshold. This approach circumvents the need for complex control schemes and reduces the post-processing overhead.</description>

Abstract: We show that in multi-stage axion monodromy inflation an interruption near the end of the penultimate stage can lead to a spike in the gravitational wave background.

      <description>arXiv:2601.09847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a new flux quantization phenomenon in metals. We study the response of normal metals to the presence of localized magnetic flux. We find that, due to backreaction effects, the metal traps 0 flux or $\tfrac{h}{2e}$ flux (half flux). We exhibit this effect both for metals pierced by magnetic solenoids and metals wrapping a magnetic solenoid. In the latter case we demonstrate the trapping of magnetic flux analytically. Furthermore, we find that as the solenoid is adiabatically turned off, a logarithmically enhanced localized equilibrium current persists, reflecting perfect defect-diamagnetism of the Fermi gas.</description>

      <title>Fragmented Topological Excitations in Generalized Hypergraph Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product code construction is a powerful tool for constructing quantum stabilizer codes, which serve as a promising paradigm for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, the natural mapping between stabilizer codes and the ground states of exactly solvable spin models also motivates the exploration of many-body orders in the stabilizer codes. In this work, we investigate the fracton topological orders in a family of codes obtained by a recently proposed general construction. More specifically, this code family can be regarded as a class of generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes. We term the corresponding exactly solvable spin models \textit{orthoplex models}, based on the geometry of the stabilizers. In the 3D orthoplex model, we identify a series of intriguing properties within this model family, including non-monotonic ground state degeneracy (GSD) as a function of system size and non-Abelian lattice defects. Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations. In addition, these rich features establish the generalized HGP codes as a versatile and analytically tractable platform for studying the physics of fracton orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist conformally invariant, higher-derivative, variational analogs of the Yang-Mills condition for connections on vector bundles over a conformal manifold of even dimension greater than or equal to six. We give a compact formula for these analogs and prove that they are a strict weakening of the Yang-Mills condition with respect to an Einstein metric. We also show that the conformal Yang-Mills condition for the tractor connection of an even dimensional conformal manifold is equivalent to vanishing of its Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor. This result uses that the tractor connection on a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold is itself Yang-Mills.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study SU(3) gauge theory on small lattices in the minimal (qutrit) electric field truncation retaining only the ${\bf 1}, {\bf 3}, {\bf \overline{3}}$ representations for the link variables. Explicit expressions are given for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the square plaquette chain and the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Our formalism can be easily extended to the minimally truncated general SU($N_c$) gauge theory. The addition of (static) quarks is discussed. We present results for the energy spectrum of the gauge field on these lattices by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and analyze its statistical properties. We also compute the SU(3) string tension and discuss how it is modified by vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we calculate the potential energies of a static quark-antiquark pair and three static quarks and study their screening at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Warm Hybrid Axion Inflation in $\alpha$-Attractor Models Constrained by ACT and Future Plan experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of warm hybrid inflation within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models, where an axionic inflaton is coupled to a waterfall field in the presence of thermal dissipation. The model is analyzed for both linear ($\Upsilon \propto T$) and cubic ($\Upsilon \propto T^{3}$) dissipation regimes. Confronting the theoretical predictions with the latest observational data from Planck+BICEP/Keck, P-ACT-LB-BK18 and SPT, and , we find that in the weak dissipative regime ($Q_{*} \lesssim 10^{-5}$), the scalar spectral index $n_{s} \simeq 0.965$ lies at the boundary of the combined P-ACT-LB-BK18 constraints, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ remains within observable ranges. For stronger dissipation ($Q_{*} \gtrsim 10^{-5}$), the model predicts values of $n_{s}$ well within the $1$--$2\sigma$ confidence region of all datasets, with tensor modes remaining fully observable in both dissipation scenarios. These results indicate that forthcoming CMB polarization experiments may be capable of detecting primordial gravitational waves, thereby providing a robust observational test of warm hybrid inflation across different dissipative regimes.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic equation for a neutral complex field as a probability amplitude is proposed. The continuity equation for the probability density is obtained. It is shown that there are two types of excitations of this field, which describe particles with positive energy and different dispersion laws. Based on the Lagrangian formalism, conservation laws are obtained. The transition to secondary quantization is considered.</description>

      <title>Effects of spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry breaking on Letelier-AdS charged black boles within Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</description>

      <title>Flavour hierarchies from radiative corrections in latticed theory space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that when $N_f$ generations of chiral fermions are coupled in a specific manner to $N$ (with $N \geq 2N_f-1$) pairs of vectorlike fermions whose mass terms form a one-dimensional lattice-like structure in theory space, locality along the lattice ensures that only a single fermion generation acquires a mass at tree level. Radiative corrections can induce controlled departures from locality in the latticed space, thereby generating suppressed but non-vanishing masses for the remaining $N_f-1$ generations. In this work, we present an explicit implementation of this mechanism to address the flavour hierarchies of the Standard Model. After delineating the minimal extensions of the gauge, scalar, and Yukawa sectors required for feasible implementation of the mechanism, we demonstrate that the framework successfully reproduces the observed charged-fermion mass spectrum and quark mixing pattern. We analyse the new-physics effects arising from the extended sectors and confront them with existing constraints from direct, indirect searches and precision measurements. It is shown that a viable realisation of the mechanism allows the spectrum of vectorlike fermions and additional gauge boson to lie at scales as low as $\mathcal{O}(5)\,\mathrm{TeV}$ with the lightest states typically corresponding to top partners. This stands in sharp contrast to conventional radiative mass-generation scenarios, in which phenomenological constraints typically impose a lower bound on the new-physics scale of order a few hundred to several thousand TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the experimental prospects for testing a relativistic local quantum measurement inequality that quantifies the trade-off between vacuum insensitivity and responsiveness to excitations for finite-size detectors. Building on the Reeh--Schlieder approximation for coherent states, we derive an explicit and practically applicable bound for arbitrary coherent states. To connect with realistic photodetection scenarios, we model the detection region as a square prism operating over a finite time window and consider a normally incident single-mode coherent state. Numerical results exhibit the expected qualitative behavior: suppressing dark counts necessarily tightens the achievable click probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.</description>

Abstract: We show how our Universe can emerge from a symmetry breaking of a multicomponent $W_3$ algebra, where the components in addition form a Jordan algebra. We discuss how symmetry breaking related to the Jordan algebras $H_3(C)$ and $H_3(O)$ over the complex and octonion numbers can lead to an extended four-dimensional spacetime, where the expansion of the Universe is governed by a modified Friedmann equation. We finally discuss how this modified Friedmann equation might explain a number of puzzling cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Massless-Massive Amplitude Correspondence I: Helicity-chirality Matching and On-shell Higgsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the massless-massive correspondence for the on-shell scattering amplitudes is constructed so the massive amplitudes could inherit advantageous techniques developed in the massless calculation. This correspondence is established by matching massless amplitudes to Minimal Helicity-Chirality (MHC) amplitudes, which arise from an expansion of massive spin-spinor amplitudes in terms of the chirality-flip $m\eta$ order by order. The primary MHC amplitude deforms into a massless amplitude of the same helicity; if a vector boson is involved, it may instead vanish due to the associated conserved current. In cases where the primary amplitude vanishes, the leading contributions originate from descendant MHC amplitudes, each corresponding to a distinct massless amplitude in the ultraviolet theory containing either a transverse gauge boson or a Goldstone boson. We propose a systematic amplitude deformation procedure for three-point massless-massive matching based on helicity-chirality unification and the scaling properties of $m\eta$. Sub-leading MHC amplitudes are matched to massless amplitudes with additional on-shell Higgs splitting, a process known as on-shell Higgsing. In this work, we extend and reinterpret on-shell Higgsing as a transversality flip between different MHC states, and obtain all the 3-point massless-massive matching results in the spontaneous broken standard model.</description>

      <title>Massless-Massive Amplitude Correspondence II: Constructive Massive Amplitudes in Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the minimal helicity-chirality formalism, we systematically construct higher-point massive amplitudes from the fundamental building blocks: the contact three-point and four-point massive amplitudes. The inclusion of four-point contact amplitudes is essential to maintain gauge invariance in the spontaneously broken Standard Model. We construct all the standard model massive contact amplitudes and identify the physical light-cone gauge nature of massive amplitudes. Then only using the contact minimal helicity-chirality amplitudes at the leading order, we show both bootstrap techniques and on-shell recursion relations can be utilized to compute higher-point massive amplitudes. This provides a systematic framework for constructing various higher-point electroweak amplitudes, analogous to established on-shell methods for massless theories. Finally by deforming the gauge-invariant $n$-point amplitudes, we extend the massless-massive correspondence from three-and-four point contact amplitudes to general $n$-point factorized amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an overview of the construction of Borcherds algebras, particularly the Monstrous Lie algebras $\mathfrak m_g$ constructed by Carnahan, where $g$ is an element of the Monster finite simple group. When $g$ is the identity element, $\mathfrak m_g$ is the Monster Lie algebra of Borcherds. We discuss the appearance of the $\mathfrak m_g$ in compactified models of the Heterotic String. We also summarize recent work on associating Lie group analogs to the Lie algebras $\mathfrak m_g$. We include a discussion of some open problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I calculated the partition function of the quantum statistical system of free massless bosonic Higher spin (HS) fields on $d$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime by using the Feynman's path integral approach, it is a nontrivial result and this explain about the self-duality between the Quantum statistical system of massless free bosonic HS fields of $s \geq 2$ over $d \geq 4$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime and the Quantum statistical system of Klein-Gordon bosonic (scalar) fields on 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime at the thermal equilibrium. However, I have been used the dimensional regularization method to calculate the free energy of this system in this calculations the ultraviolet divergences(UV) present that could be eliminated. Nevertheless, still have infrared (IR) divergences in this theory and also I discussed about the average energy and the entropy of this system over $d \geq 4$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In particular,the most significant result is that the average energy spectrum of quantum statistical system of massless bosonic HS fields is similar to the blackbody radiation energy spectrum at different temperatures and also it explain the Universe cosmic microwave background(CMB)radiation spectrum (COBE data) at 2.7 kelvin temperature. However, the entropy of massless free bosonic HS fields also explain the self duality between the massless free bosonic HS fields and Klein-Gordon bosonic (scalar) fields over 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.00047v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noether's first and second theorems both imply conserved currents that can be identified as an energy-momentum tensor (EMT). The first theorem identifies the EMT as the conserved current associated with global spacetime translations, while the second theorem identifies it as a conserved current associated with local spacetime translations. This work obtains an EMT for quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics through the second theorem, which is automatically symmetric in its indices and invariant under the expected symmetries (e.g., BRST invariance) without the need for introducing an ad hoc improvement procedure.</description>

Abstract: We study certain higher point thermal correlators of heavy and light scalar primaries in a holographic CFT. Assuming simple self-interactions and couplings of the scalars in the bulk theory, we show that the thermal correlators contain a signature of the proper time to singularity from the horizon. The key idea is to use WKB approximations for the propagators and evaluate the bulk integrals using saddle point method.</description>

      <title>Rational RG flow, extension, and Witt class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

      <title>Formation of Asymmetrical Two-Brane Structure and its Possible Manifestation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the class of extra-dimensional models with two branes and show that each field of the Standard Model must be localized on both neighboring branes, whose asymmetry is of great importance. The discussion is conducted in the framework of a previously developed model. Here we show that the Higgs vacuum average is brane-dependent. As the result, fermion masses on the two branes are also different. The second brane (brane-2) lacks observers, eliminating the need for fine-tuning; consequently the particle masses remains of the order of the initial energy scale of the universe formation. Such superheavy charged leptons may serve as a small component of dark matter. Additionally, we show that inter-brane interactions mediated by photons enable massive fermions in brane-2 to act as sources of ultra-high-energy particles. The gauge fields are uniformly distributed in the bulk, ensuring charge universality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret the Euclidean solution of JT de Sitter gravity as the Coleman-de Luccia instanton for the decay of the low-entropy horizon of its static patch solution into either a Big Crunch or an infinite-entropy Lorentzian de Sitter cosmology. As in previous work by one of the authors, the Big Crunch is interpreted as bounding the entropy of the static state. The principle of detailed balance then guarantees it will transition back to a higher entropy causal diamond in the expanding cosmology. We then construct a family of explicit quantum mechanical models and appropriate metastable states, with transition probabilities well approximated by the semi-classical calculations in JT de Sitter gravity.</description>

      <title>Classicized dynamics and initial conditions in field theories with fakeons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories with purely virtual particles (fakeons) do not possess a classical action in the strict sense, but rather a "classicized" one, obtained by integrating out the fake particles at tree level. Although this procedure generates nonlocal interactions, we show that the resulting classicized equations of motion are not burdened with the need to specify infinitely many initial conditions. The reason is the inherent link between the fakeonic system and the parent higher-derivative local system: the solution space of the former is an appropriate subspace of solutions of the latter. A somewhat unexpected proviso is that, in order to avoid overcounting, the fakeon prescription must be obtained as a limit or special case of a more generic prescription. Ultimately, the set of degrees of freedom matches physical expectations, the extra ones (ghosts or otherwise) being removed by rendering them purely virtual. We illustrate the counting in simple linear solvable models and provide the general proof. Along similar lines, we analyze Dirac's removal of runaway solutions in classical electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the crossing symmetry of the ensemble of large-$c$ 2D CFTs defined through 3D gravity. A central observation is that statistical moments of OPE coefficients are not independent; rather, lower and higher moments are strongly correlated. Using Virasoro TQFT, we clarify how these correlations arise and how they guarantee consistency across OPE channels. Our analysis introduces the new notion of pseudo-hyperbolic manifolds, which are a certain class of non-hyperbolic manifolds whose partition functions are nevertheless related to those of hyperbolic ones. These manifolds serve as bridges that help manifest the crossing symmetry of the CFT ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent works have revealed a simplicity in equal-time correlators that is absent in their wavefunction counterparts. In this letter, we show that this arises from the simple fact that the correlator is obtained by integrating Feynman propagators over the full spacetime, as opposed to the half-space for the wavefunction. Several striking new properties of correlators for any graph are made obvious from this picture. Certain patterns of poles that appear in the wavefunction do not appear in the correlator. The correlator also enjoys several remarkable factorization properties in various limits. Most strikingly, the correlator admits a systematic Laurent expansion in the neighborhood of every pole, with the first subleading term vanishing for every pole. There is an especially simple understanding of the expansion around the total energy pole up to second order, given by a differential operator acting on the amplitude. Finally, we show how these results extend beyond single graphs to the full correlator in Tr $\phi^3$ theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop corrections in QED and gravity have recently been conjectured to give rise to an infinite tower of logarithmic soft theorems governing the universal low-energy behavior of photons and gravitons. We explore the implications of this tower for celestial CFT and for the algebra of conformally soft operators. The symmetry-governed part of the tower of logarithmic soft factors is shown to exponentiate, which demonstrates that these loop effects do not represent independent multi-particle interactions, but instead are rooted in the long-range exchange of gauge bosons between pairs of hard operator insertions. We define conformally soft loop operators, and compute their operator product expansions on the celestial sphere. The associated Ward identities exhibit characteristic non-local behaviors, which reflect the pair-wise interactions between hard operator insertions mediated by gauge bosons. We comment on the implications of these results for the soft operator algebra at loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive several new Bogomol'nyi (self-dual) equations in two-species $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories governed by the Born--Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. By identifying appropriate Born--Infeld type Higgs potentials, we show that the highly nonlinear energy functionals admit exact topological lower bounds saturated by coupled first-order equations. The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings.
  Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges. These results provide a rare analytically solvable framework for studying thermodynamics in nonlinear multi-component gauge theories regulated by the Born--Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in generalized symmetries have drawn significant attention to gapped phases of matter exhibiting novel symmetries, such as noninvertible symmetries. By leveraging the duality transformations, the classification and construction of gapped phases with noninvertible symmetry can be mapped to those involving conventional group symmetries. We demonstrate this approach by classifying symmetry-protected-topological phases with a broad class of noninvertible symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our results reveal new classifications that extend beyond those based on group symmetries. Additionally, we construct lattice models in $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ that realize these new phases and explore their anomalous interfaces.</description>

      <title>Dissipation meets conformal interface in open quantum systems: How the relaxation rate is suppressed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In closed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are typically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the interface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\text{LR}}$, which measures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to characterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum systems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\text{relax}}$, which is defined through the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface. Physically, $c_{\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate towards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We perform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical calculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found that $c_{\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the interface. In particular, $0\le c_{\text{relax}}\le c_{\text{LR}}\le c_{\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is totally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\text{relax}}$ is universal in the sense that $c_{\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the dissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where the local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known $c_{\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\text{relax}}$ shows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting its novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering insights into critical systems under dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in ${1+1}$D. To this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of ${2+1}$D SETs affect the enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and detecting anomalies of the ${1+1}$D symmetry, as well as to classifying ${1+1}$D symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations, the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study gauging for such examples.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three-dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.</description>

      <title>Wormhole spacetimes in an expanding universe: Energy conditions and future singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study wormhole geometries embedded in an expanding universe within a four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model, where the target-space metric is identified with the spacetime Ricci tensor. In this framework, wormholes can remain stable even when conventional energy conditions are violated. However, once cosmological expansion is included, the effective energy density and pressure are modified by the cosmological fluid, enabling the energy conditions to be satisfied. We further present intriguing geometries in which a finite future singularity appears in our universe but not in another universe connected by the wormhole. Near the throat, the hypersurface becomes timelike, allowing trajectories to traverse to the other universe before the singularity and return afterwards. We also construct wormhole solutions motivated by galactic dark-matter halo profiles, where the required non-vanishing pressure arises naturally from the four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-parameter inhomogeneous and time-dependent Pimentel solution of Brans-Dicke theory is analyzed to probe and extend the new thermal view in which General Relativity is the zero-temperature (equilibrium) state of scalar-tensor gravity. As the parameters vary, we uncover phenomenology not found before with other exact solutions, nor contemplated thus far in the general theory. In the process, we also discuss the anomalous limit to General Relativity of the Pimentel geometry and show how the Mars solution of the Einstein equations is its Einstein frame version, elucidating the relation between these geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable, making the effective dimension state-dependent. Interestingly, systems of this form can exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a two-state system for which the number of spatial dimensions is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic models in LQC with GBP polymerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polymer models are effective in describing quantum gravity effects around the initial singularity, leading to its replacement by bouncing surfaces on which the curvature and densities are finite. Their properties depend on the space-time symmetry and on the particular polymerisation scheme adopted. In this article we investigate anisotropic models under the Gambini-Ben\'itez-Pullin polymerisation, recently used to quantise spherically symmetric black-holes, whose interiors are isometric to Kantowski-Sachs (KS) space-times. Demanding that the minimum area defined by the bouncing surface matches the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap, we can find its radius alongside the curvature and effective density and pressures at the bounce. The density is always positive, while the pressures are negative enough to avoid the singularity. Due to the positive spatial curvature, the solution is oscillatory, reaching a maximum radius where a re-collapse occurs. Therefore, a positive cosmological constant is included in order to have an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. We have also considered a Bianchi III metric, showing that the bounce is still present, but the space-time is asymptotically flat in this case, with no re-collapse. In this hyperbolic space, the minimal area constraint can also be imposed on compact $2$-surfaces. Nevertheless, in contrast to the KS case, it is enough for avoiding the singularity, independently of polymerisation procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>Three-loop jet function for boosted top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the calculation of the inclusive jet function for highly energetic heavy quarks at order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ using boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). This jet function describes the effect of collinear radiation emitted by energetic heavy quarks on observables dependent on the jet invariant mass $M$. In particular, we focus on the regime $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, which is relevant for boosted top quark production at high-energy colliders in the resonance region. Our results are consistent with non-Abelian exponentiation and reproduce the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions up to three loops. We also verify that the $n_\ell^2 \alpha_s^3$ contribution, with $n_\ell$ denoting the number of light quark flavors, agrees with predictions from renormalon calculus. This calculation completes the list of ingredients required for the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution, an essential component for calibrating the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. It likewise contributes to the invariant-mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks, enabling precise mass determinations at future lepton colliders. Finally, we determine the relation between the pole and two short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ and provide an estimate of the non-logarithmic part of the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I review the standard instanton framework for determining the $\theta$-dependence of instanton-dominated correlation functions in QCD. I then contrast these well-established semiclassical results with the recent assertion of [1,2], that $\theta$-phases are absent and that strong interactions preserve CP for all values of $\theta$. In all scenarios considered, the $\theta$-dependence is shown to be intrinsically non-trivial, being governed either by instantons in the weak-coupling regime or by alternative, non-perturbative considerations when the theory is strongly coupled.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Symmetry in Spherically-symmetric Static Mini-superspaces with Matter Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schr\"odinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schr\"odinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schr\"odinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schr\"odinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schr\"odinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schr\"odinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Area Bound for Information Transfer Through Semiclassical Traversable Wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new area theorem in general relativity showing that, after a Gao-Jafferis-Wall deformation is switched off, the area of a wormhole throat cross-section cannot increase under infalling matter obeying the null energy condition. As a consequence, the minimal throat area sets a sharp upper bound on information transfer. Using the max-flow/min-cut formulation of bit threads, we show that the number of independent quantum degrees of freedom that can be transmitted through a semiclassical traversable wormhole is bounded by the throat area. We further illustrate the bound with a holographic tensor-network toy model built from two glued HaPPY codes.</description>

      <title>Motions of spinning particles and chaos bound in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research showed that the chaos bound proposed in \cite{MSS} can be violated under specific conditions within the scalar fields surrounding black holes. In this paper, we explore motions of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and examine whether this bound is violated in the spinor field of this black hole. For the neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the value of the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation of the bound. Given a fixed total angular momentum of the particle, when its spin direction is anti-aligned with the angular momentum direction, the exponent value is greater than that when the two directions are aligned. For the charged particle, taking into account the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent's variation with respect to spin and angular momentum, and only modifies its values, it still leads to the violation. Therefore, the chaos bound violations are observed in the spinor field.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified quantum field theory of dark energy and inflation: unstable de Sitter vacuum and running vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\Lambda\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The net outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help cure the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>A Non-Renormalization Theorem for Local Functionals in Ghost-Free Vector Field Theories Coupled to Dynamical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a non-renormalization theorem for a class of ghost-free local functionals describing massive vector field theories coupled to dynamical geometry. Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders.</description>
