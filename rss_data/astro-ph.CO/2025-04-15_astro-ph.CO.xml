      <title>The Complete Sample of Available SNe Ia Luminosity Calibrations from the TRGB Observed with either HST or JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance ladders which calibrate the luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) currently provide the strongest constraints on the local value of H0. Recent studies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) show good consistency between measurements of SNe Ia host distances. These are calibrated to NGC 4258 using different primary distance indicators (Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch, and Miras). However, some sub-samples of calibrated SNe Ia employed to measure H0 yield noteworthy differences due to small sample statistics but also due to differences in sample selection. This issue is particularly important for TRGB-derived calibrations owing to the smaller volume they reach compared to Cepheids, reducing sample size and enhancing the size of statistical fluctuations. To mitigate this issue, we compile the largest and complete (as currently available) sample of HST or JWST measurements of the TRGB in the hosts of normal SNe Ia for a total of N=35, 50% larger than the previous largest. Most are present in the literature, and we compile multiple measures when available. We also add 5 SNe Ia hosts from the HST archive not previously published. The full sample together with the Pantheon+ SN catalog gives H0=72.1-73.3 +/- 1.8 km/s/Mpc (depending on methodology), in good agreement with the value of 72.5 +/- 1.5 km/s/Mpc from HST Cepheids in hosts of 42 SNe Ia calibrated by the same anchor, NGC 4258. We trace the difference in the result of H0=70.4 +/- 1.9 km/s/Mpc from Freedman et al. 2025 to 11 hosts not selected for that CCHP compilation (of N=24) which alone yield H0=74.1 km/s/Mpc, 2$\sigma$ higher than the selected sample. A smaller increase of 0.6 km/s/Mpc comes from a commonly employed correction for peculiar velocities.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Nonlinear Gravity on the Cosmological Background During Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical relativity to study the violent preheating era at the end of inflation. This epoch can result in highly nonlinear fluctuations in density and gravitational potential which feed back onto the averaged expansion rate -- an effect known as backreaction. Usually, simulations of preheating use the Friedmann constraint to enforce the Hubble expansion of spacetime during the evolution. In numerical relativity, this is not required and the inhomogeneous spacetime is evolved self-consistently. For a 'vanilla' preheating model, we find a violation of the Friedmann constraint at the level of $0.005\%$ over the entire simulation. This violation increases to $\sim10\%$ as we sample smaller scales in the simulation domain.</description>

      <title>Detecting the 21 cm Signal of the Cosmic Dark Ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic "Dark Ages" is the period between the last scattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the appearance of the first luminous sources, spanning redshifts $1100\gtrsim z\gtrsim 30$. The only way to observe this period is by examining the 21 cm hyperfine transition line of neutral hydrogen HI, which -- given the high redshifts (and hence long wavelengths) -- must be observed from outside the Earth's ionosphere. Given the faintness of the signal, concepts for a radio array on the lunar far side (where large collecting areas can be deployed and radio frequency interference is minimal) have been proposed, like FarView or FARSIDE, but designs are still in the preliminary stages. This paper studies multiple aspects of array design to determine the impact of different design decisions on sensitivity to the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum. We do so by using the sensitivity package 21cmSense to model and simulate various array configurations. We present a fiducial design based on a modification of the FarView concept, which consists of a collecting area of $\sim2.5\,\rm{km}^{2}$ with 82,944 tightly packed dual-polarization dipoles grouped into 5,184 correlated elements, or subarrays, delivering a $&gt;10\sigma$ detection of the $z=30$ signal with a five year lifetime. We find that, beyond mere collecting area, the most important factor in achieving this sensitivity is the presence of very short baselines that can only be realized with small, closely packed antennas.</description>

      <title>Comparison of dark energy models using late-universe observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of general relativity, dark energy was proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration. A pivotal inquiry in cosmology is to determine whether dark energy is the cosmological constant, and if not, the challenge lies in constraining how it evolves with time. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain some typical dark energy models, and make a comparison for them according to their capabilities of fitting the current data. Our study is confined to late-universe observations, including the baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data. We employ the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to assess the worth of models. The AIC analysis indicates that all dark energy models outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the BIC analysis leaves room for $\Lambda$CDM due to its heavier penalty on the model complexity. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, most dark energy models are robustly supported by AIC while being explicitly disfavored by BIC. The models that are robustly favored by AIC and not explicitly disfavored by BIC include the $w$CDM, interacting dark energy, and Ricci dark energy models. Furthermore, we observe that an alternative modified gravity model exhibits superior performance when compared with $\Lambda$CDM from both the AIC and BIC perspectives.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the simultaneous variation of the fine structure constant and electron mass in light of DESI BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological constraints of the time variation of the electron mass $m_e$ and the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, using data of cosmic microwave background, supernovae light curve and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data including the recent DESI BAO DR2 measurements. The results are slightly depending on the BAO data set included in the analysis. The latest DESI BAO DR2 data strongly indicates that $m_e$ or $\alpha$ is slightly larger than the previous data from 6DF+SDSS and DESI BAO DR1. We also compare the varying $m_e$ model, the varying $\alpha$ model, and the simultaneous variation of $m_e$ and $\alpha$. When considering the Hubble tension, a larger electron mass is the most promising option and the variation of the fine-structure constants does not alleviate the tension.</description>

      <title>Decaying vacuum energy, matter creation and cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an interacting decaying vacuum energy and dark matter empowered by gravitationally induced matter creation model, and its impact on structure formation by analysing the growth rate perturbations. Our work is motivated by the possibility that the decaying vacuum is due to quantum field theory and dark matter originates from gravitationally induced matter creation. We delve deeper into our investigation and explore both theoretical and statistical analysis of the cosmological model to test its ability to describe the evolution of the Universe. To achieve this, we use three distinct combinations of datasets from CC, Pantheon SNIa sample, BAO, CMB distance priors and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ datapoints to constrain the model parameters. Our statistical analysis employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The deceleration parameter shows that the model transitions from a decelerated phase to an accelerated phase of expansion. The current Hubble parameter values are estimated to be $H_0=67.517 \pm 0.869$ km/s/Mpc, $H_0=67.534\pm 0.874$ km/s/Mpc, and $H_0=67.533 \pm 0.884$ km/s/Mpc using DS1, DS2 and DS3 datasets, respectively. These values of $H_0$ are very close to those derived from the Planck data. The effective equation of state parameter indicates an accelerating phase, with density parameter for vacuum energy exhibiting expected values. We analyse the stability characteristics through the selection information criteria. We also perform thermodynamic analysis by studying the evolution of entropy in the Universe for the model and find it to be in agreement with the generalized second law of thermodynamics. These findings support that the proposed model effectively describes the evolutionary features of the Universe at both theoretical and observational levels.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from a curvaton: the role of bimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes in curvaton models of inflation, where the curvature perturbation is not only generated by the inflaton but also by a light scalar field (the curvaton) that decays after inflation. During inflation, both fields are subject to quantum diffusion, owing to small-scale vacuum fluctuations crossing out the Hubble radius. After inflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its field value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different regions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories. In practice, we show that this results in a double-peaked distribution for the number of e-folds realised in these models. Since that number of e-folds is related to the curvature perturbation by the delta-N formalism, the presence of a second peak has important consequences for primordial black holes that we discuss.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the lepton asymmetry from DESI DR2 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is important to explore the potential existence of lepton asymmetry in the neutrino sector. Conducting a joint analysis of DESI DR2 BAO data and \emph{Planck} 2018 CMB data, we obtain the upper limits on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, i.e., $\xi_{3}&lt;0.56$ for the normal mass hierarchy while $\xi_{3}&lt;0.62$ for the inverted mass hierarchy, at 95\% confidence level. Considering the influence of the dynamical dark energy, we find that these upper limits remain to be robust. This work may provide helpful implications for model buildings of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in a Fractal Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work discusses the influence of galaxy mergers in the evolution of a parabolic Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) cosmology with simultaneous big bang endowed with two consecutive single fractal galaxy distributions systems possessing fractal dimension $D$. Based on recent empirical findings, it is assumed that the resulting galaxy mass from mergers can be expressed by a redshift dependent decaying power law. The proposed cosmological model modifies the relativistic fractal number counts distribution by including a merger rate evolution that estimates the model's radial density. Numerical solutions for the first order small-merger-rate approximation (SMRA) are found and the results show that a fractal galaxy distribution having $D=1.5$ in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0$, and $D=0.5$ for $1&lt;z&lt;6$, as suggested by recent empirical findings, the SMRA allows consistent description of the model for a merger rate power law exponent up to $q=0.2$ considering a fractal galaxy distribution starting from the Local Group. Consistent values were also found up to $q=2.5$ and $z=7$ from a scale smaller than the Local Supercluster. These results show that galaxy mergers can be successfully incorporated into the dynamics of a parabolic LTB fractal cosmology.</description>

      <title>Improved null tests of $\Lambda$CDM and FLRW in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DESI DR2 BAO data exclude the flat $\Lambda$CDM model at more than 2.5$\sigma$, depending on different data combinations when analyzed through the $w_0w_a$CDM parametrization. This simple parametrization may introduce bias in the results. We use null tests that probe for deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM at late times, independent of any specific dark energy parametrization. We provide several diagnostics for null tests and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we derive diagnostics that improve on previous ones, such as the popular $O_{\rm m}$ diagnostic. The diagnostics are derived from both background and perturbed quantities. Using the combination of DESI DR2 BAO and supernova data, with or without CMB data, we find that deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM are at $\sim1\sigma$ confidence level in most of the redshift range (more than 1$\sigma$ for a few small redshift intervals in a few cases). These deviations are minor for other non-DESI SDSS-IV BAO data combined with Pantheon+, with or without CMB data. Since spatial curvature can potentially modify the results, we also test for curvature in the general $\Lambda$CDM model and the general FLRW model. While there is slight evidence for nonzero cosmic curvature at lower redshifts in a general $\Lambda$CDM model, there is no statistically significant evidence in a general FLRW model.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Late Cosmic Reionization Driven by Massive Galaxies: a Joint Analysis of Constraints from 21-cm, Lyman Line &amp; CMB Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) have the potential to answer long-standing questions of astrophysical interest regarding the nature of the first luminous sources and their effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present astrophysical constraints from a Neural Density Estimation-Accelerated Bayesian joint analysis of constraints deriving from Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum measurements from Planck and SPT, IGM neutral fraction measurements from Lyman-line-based data sets and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, LOFAR and the MWA. In the context of the model employed, the data is found to be consistent with galaxies forming from predominantly atomic-cooled hydrogen gas in dark matter halos, with masses $M_\mathrm{min} \gtrsim 2.6 \times 10^{9}~M_{\odot} ((1+z)/10)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ at 95% credibility ($V_\mathrm{c} \gtrsim 50~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) being the dominant galactic population driving reionization. These galaxies reionize the neutral hydrogen in the IGM over a narrow redshift interval ($\Delta z_\mathrm{re} &lt; 1.8$ at 95% credibility), with the midpoint of reionization (when the sky-averaged IGM neutral fraction is 50%) constrained to $z_{50} = 7.16^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$. Given the parameter posteriors from our joint analysis, we find that the posterior predictive distribution of the global 21-cm signal is reduced in amplitude and shifted to lower redshifts relative to the model prior. We caution, however, that our inferences are model-dependent. Future work incorporating updated, mass-dependent star formation efficiencies in atomic cooling halos, informed by the latest UV luminosity function constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope, promises to refine these inferences further and enhance our understanding of cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: Theory Modelling and Forecasts for Stage IV Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete treatment of the bispectrum of intrinsic alignments, both in three spatial dimensions and in projection in the flat-sky approximation. Since intrinsic alignment is a spin-2 observable, the bispectrum of intrinsic alignments contains a parity-even and a parity-odd part, the latter being nonzero even in the absence of parity violation. Moreover, all possible combinations of scalar, E- and B-mode bispectra are nonzero in the absence of parity violation. In analogy to the galaxy bispectrum in redshift space, we construct a complete set of multipoles for anisotropic bispectra of projected spin-2 fields. We then construct separable bispectrum estimators, both for parity-even and parity-odd bispectra, which can be computed by means of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). We compare several different choices of angular weighting in terms of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for a Stage IV setup using luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with galaxy shapes measured by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Assuming an overlapping area of $\sim 4,000$ square degrees (yielding $\sim 1.3$ million LRGs) and including scales up to $k_\text{max} = 0.14\,h$/Mpc, we find that the position-position-E-mode bispectrum $B_{DDE}$ (which is parity-even) can be strongly detected at SNR $\sim 30$, while detecting parity-odd bispectra (such as $B_{DDB}$, SNR $\sim 5$) or bispectra with more than one shape field (such as $B_{DEE}$, SNR $\sim 5$) may also be possible.</description>

      <title>Extracting cosmological information from the abundance of galaxy clusters with simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift is a well-established and powerful cosmological probe. Cosmological analyses based on galaxy cluster number counts have traditionally relied on explicitly computed likelihoods, which are often challenging to develop with the required accuracy and expensive to evaluate. In this work, we implement an alternative approach based on simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that relies solely on synthetic galaxy cluster catalogues generated under a given model. These catalogues are much easier to produce than it is to develop and validate a likelihood. We validate this approach in the context of the galaxy cluster survey of the upcoming Simons Observatory for a setup in which we can also evaluate an exact explicit likelihood. We find that our SBI-based approach yields cosmological parameter posterior means that are within $0.2\,\sigma$ of those obtained with the explicit likelihood and with biases smaller than $0.1\,\sigma$. We also introduce and validate a procedure to assess the goodness of fit using only synthetic catalogues similar to those used for training. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a galaxy cluster number count cosmological analysis can be performed fully without resorting to a likelihood at any stage. Finally, we apply our SBI-based approach to the real Planck MMF3 cosmology sample, obtaining cosmological parameter constraints that are within $0.1\,\sigma$ of their likelihood-based counterparts. This constitutes the first SBI-based number count cosmological analysis of a real galaxy cluster catalogue.</description>

      <title>Cosmological zoom-in simulation of fuzzy dark matter down to z = 0: tidal evolution of subhaloes in a Milky Way-sized halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subhaloes are critical in distinguishing dark matter models, yet their evolution within galactic haloes, particularly in the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) model, remains challenging to fully investigate in numerical simulations. In this work, we employ the fluid-wave hybrid scheme recently implemented in the GAMER-2 code to perform a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-sized halo with an FDM particle mass of m = 2 x 10^(-23) eV. It simultaneously resolves the solitonic core of the host halo and tracks the complex tidal evolution of subhaloes down to redshift z = 0. We examine the internal structure of subhaloes by analyzing their density profiles, velocity dispersions, and density power spectra across various redshifts. Our findings show that partially tidally stripped subhaloes deviate from the core-halo mass relation; their solitons remain intact and are enveloped by smaller granules predominantly from the host halo. Furthermore, our simulation unravels a complex tidal evolution of FDM subhaloes. On the one hand, we observe a subhalo core undergoing complete tidal disruption at z ~ 0.14, which later reemerges near the outskirts of the host halo around z ~ 0. This disruption event, characterized by a core contaminated with interference fringes from the host halo's wave function, occurs earlier than previously predicted. On the other hand, FDM subhaloes have denser cores before infall due to the presence of central solitons, making them more resilient to tidal disruption than their N-body counterparts. Our results demonstrate GAMER-2's capability to resolve non-linear FDM substructure down to z = 0, paving the way for future studies of larger FDM subhalo samples with heavier particle masses.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime torsion source an extremely red-tilted cosmological GW background?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of spacetime torsion, any generic $f(R)$ model of gravity is conformally dual to a scalar-tensor theory augmented with a second rank antisymmetric massless degree of freedom. We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) that may be sourced directly at the second order by such a torsional field, treated perturbatively during an epoch of canonical, single-field, slow-roll inflation. The resulting second-order induced SGWB, which dominates over the primary inflationary GW background at all scales, peaks only at ultra-low frequencies, and is found to be extremely red-tilted with an effective tensor spectral index $\alpha_{\rm T}\sim-6$ on matter-dominated scales. The signal is potentially within the reach of upcoming indirect GW probes on very large scales $k\lesssim10^{-2}\:\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, i.e., next-generation CMB experiments like the LiteBIRD. In the near future, observation of such a markedly red-tilted SGWB on CMB scales could hence provide a novel and unique clue in favour of torsional gravity during the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DESI DR1 Full-Shape analyses using HOD-informed priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) that incorporates Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)-informed priors into Full-Shape (FS) modeling of the power spectrum based on cosmological perturbation theory (PT). By leveraging physical insights from the galaxy-halo connection, these HOD-informed priors on nuisance parameters substantially mitigate projection effects in extended cosmological models that allow for dynamical dark energy. The resulting credible intervals now encompass the posterior maximum from the baseline analysis using gaussian priors, eliminating a significant posterior shift observed in baseline studies. In the $\Lambda$CDM framework, a combined DESI DR1 FS information and constraints from the DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)-including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints and a weak prior on the scalar spectral index-yields $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.2994\pm 0.0090$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.836^{+0.024}_{-0.027}$, representing improvements of approximately 4% and 23% over the baseline analysis, respectively. For the $w_0w_a$CDM model, our results from various data combinations are highly consistent, with all configurations converging to a region with $w_0 &gt; -1$ and $w_a &lt; 0$. This convergence not only suggests intriguing hints of dynamical dark energy but also underscores the robustness of our HOD-informed prior approach in delivering reliable cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>Anchors no more: Using peculiar velocities to constrain $H_0$ and the primordial Universe without calibrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the primordial power spectrum amplitude $A_\mathrm{s}$ using supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data. By considering SNIa as tracers of the peculiar velocity field, we can model their distance and their covariance as a function of cosmological parameters without the need of calibrators like Cepheids; this yields a new independent probe of the large-scale structure based on SNIa data without distance anchors. Crucially, we implement a differentiable pipeline in JAX, including efficient emulators and affine sampling, reducing inference time from years to hours on a single GPU. We first validate our method on mock datasets, demonstrating that we can constrain $H_0$ and $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ within $\sim10\%$ using $\sim10^3$ SNIa. We then test our pipeline with SNIa from an $N$-body simulation, obtaining $7\%$-level unbiased constraints on $H_0$ with a moderate noise level. We finally apply our method to Pantheon+ data, constraining $H_0$ at the $10\%$ level without Cepheids when fixing $A_\mathrm{s}$ to its $\it{Planck}$ value. On the other hand, we obtain $15\%$-level constraints on $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ in agreement with $\it{Planck}$ when including Cepheids in the analysis. In light of upcoming observations of low redshift SNIa from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, surveys for which our method will develop its full potential, we make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Implications of distance duality violation for the $H_0$ tension and evolving dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether a violation of the distance duality relation (DDR), $D_L(z) = (1+z)^2 D_A(z)$, connecting the angular diameter and luminosity distances, can explain the Hubble tension and alter the evidence for dynamical dark energy in recent cosmological observations. We constrain five phenomenological parameterisations of DDR violation using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the DESI survey calibrated with the sound horizon derived from \textit{Planck} Cosmic Microwave Background data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SNIa) catalogue calibrated with the supernova absolute magnitude from S$H_0$ES. We find that two toy models can resolve the tension: a constant offset in the DDR (equivalent to a shift in the calibration of the SNIa data), $D_L(z)/D_A(z)\simeq 0.925(1+z)^2$, which leaves the hint for evolving dark energy unaffected; or a change in the power-law redshift-dependence of the DDR, restricted to $z\lesssim 1$, $D_L(z)/D_A(z)\simeq(1+z)^{1.866}$, together with a {\it constant} phantom dark energy equation of state $w\sim -1.155$. The Bayesian evidence slightly favours the latter model. Our phenomenological approach motivates the investigation of physical models of DDR violation as a novel way to explain the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbations, dubbing these induced tensor modes $\textit{vector-induced gravitational waves}$ (VIGWs). Notably, considering an inflation-inspired power-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\propto k^{n_\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological horizon at the end of reheating, $k_\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak amplitude scaling as $\Omega_{\rm GW}(k_{\rm reh},\eta_0)\propto \Delta N_{\rm reh}\times(H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\rm inf}$ is the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation and $\Delta N_{\rm reh}$ the duration of the post-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\rm B}&gt;-3/2$, one further obtains a nearly $n_{\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the GW spectrum of the form $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f,\eta_0)\propto \left(\frac{f}{f_{\rm reh}}\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f&gt;f_\mathrm{reh}\equiv k_\mathrm{reh}/(2\pi)$. Finally, we need to highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales. Indicatively, for $H_{\rm inf} \sim O(10^{7})\:\mathrm{GeV}$ and $O(10^{14})\:\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\Delta N_{\rm reh} \sim 15$ and $10$, the VIGW signal is found to be detectable by LISA and ET respectively.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with the angular cross-correlation of gravitational-wave and galaxy catalogs: forecasts for next-generation interferometers and the Euclid survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the angular power spectrum of gravitational-wave and galaxy catalogs in tomographic redshift and distance bins as a probe of late-time cosmology, focusing specifically on next-generation ground-based interferometers in combination with the Euclid photometric survey. We assess the potential of this technique to constrain the Hubble constant and the matter energy density. Our analysis incorporates realistic gravitational-wave source populations, error modelling calibrated on recent detector designs, and accounts for nuisance parameters. We show that the tomographic angular cross-correlation could determine the Hubble constant to percent or sub-percent precision depending on the binning choice, configuration and operation time of gravitational-wave observatories. This conclusion holds even when marginalising over the unknown tracer biases, primordial power-spectrum parameters and baryon density. In particular, we show that the combination of the galaxy auto-correlation spectra and the cross-correlation of gravitational waves and galaxy surveys can lead to an improvement of up to a factor ${{\sim}}10$ in constraining power over either of the two probes taken individually. However, this prospect crucially relies on the presence of multiple gravitational-wave interferometers able to yield precise sky localisation. We also discuss the use of a spectroscopic redshift catalog, as well as the detectability of the clustering bias of gravitational-wave sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit scale separation for compactifications of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. For cosmological solutions rolling down flux-generated potentials, we observe that scale separation is achieved as time flows, and is fairly generic. This is realized without the need of orientifolds nor corrections to the classical supergravity approximation. We then confront scale separation with the Covariant Entropy Bound (CEB) and the CKN bound. We show that a naive application of these bounds to vacua hints at the existence of at least two extra dimensions. For rolling solutions, we observe that the CEB is not always respected, but since these examples lack a cosmic horizon, the application of entropy bounds remains delicate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paleodetection has been proposed as a competitive method for detecting dark matter and other new physics interactions, complementing conventional direct detection experiments. In this work, we utilise TRIM simulations to improve the modelling of track length distributions. Our findings suggest that previous studies have overestimated the number of tracks caused by weakly interacting particles, and that the lowest observable dark matter mass should be higher than previously predicted. These differences are mainly attributed to the fact that (a) the recoil energy-track length relation is not one-to-one, (b) at low recoil energies, a substantial fraction of recoils do not yield any tracks, and (c) at high energies, electronic stopping becomes dominant, resulting in a track length barrier at $\sim200$ nm. In addition to WIMPs, we also modelled tracks from generalised coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) via new light mediators and estimated the projected sensitivity for these interactions.</description>

      <title>Observability of Acausal and Uncorrelated Optical-Quasar Pairs for Quantum-Mechanical Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viewing high-redshift sources at near-opposite directions on the sky can assure, by light-travel-time arguments, acausality between their emitted photons. One utility would be true random-number generation, by sensing these via two independent telescopes that each flip a switch based on those latest-arrived colours; for example, to autonomously control a quantum-mechanical (QM) experiment. Although demonstrated with distant quasars, those were not fully acausal pairs, which are restricted in simultaneous view from the ground at any single observatory. In optical light such faint sources also require large telescope aperture to avoid sampling assumptions when imaged at fast camera framerates: either unsensed intrinsic correlations between them or equivalently-correlated noise may ruin the expectation of pure randomness. One such case which could spoil a QM test is considered. Based on that, allowed geometries and instrumental limits are modelled for any two ground-based sites, and their data simulated. To compare, an analysis of photometry from the Gemini twin 8-m telescopes is presented, using archival data of well-separated bright stars, obtained with the instruments 'Alopeke (on Gemini-North in Hawai'i) and Zorro (on Gemini-South in Chile) simultaneously in two bands (centred at 562 nm and 832 nm) with 17 Hz framerate. No flux correlation is found, calibrating an analytic model, predicting where a search at signal-to-noise over 50 at 50 Hz with the same instrumentation can be made. Finally, the software PDQ (Predict Different Quasars) is presented which searches a large catalogue of known quasars, reporting those with brightness and visibility suitable to verify acausal, uncorrelated photons at those limits.</description>

      <title>Late-time acceleration and structure formation in interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models. Specifically, we analyze the associated autonomous system, focusing on its fixed points that represent dark energy and scaling solutions, along with their stability conditions. We employ center manifold theory to address cases where some fixed points display eigenvalues with zero and negative real parts. The model reveals attractors describing dark energy, enabling a smooth transition from the radiation-dominated era to the matter-dominated era, and ultimately into the dark-energy-dominated phase. Additionally, we identify a scaling matter solution capable of modifying the growth rate of matter perturbations during the matter-dominated epoch. Consequently, we study the evolution of matter perturbations by obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions to the density contrast evolution equation. Based on these results, we compute numerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\sigma_{8}$, indicating that interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models may provide a better fit to structure formation data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Metastable Strings in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \times U(1)_\chi$ yields the GUT monopole as well as a comparably heavy $U(1)_\chi$ monopole which also carries $U(1)_Y$ flux. A metastable string scenario in this case requires that the $U(1)_\chi$ symmetry is necessarily broken close to the GUT scale, thus resulting in a dimensionless string tension $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$. We show that the $\chi$ monopole does not carry any unconfined flux following the electroweak symmetry breaking. Coupled with $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$, this metastable string network appears to provide a good fit to the recent Pulsar Timing Array data on the stochastic gravitational background. Gauge coupling unification, especially in the presence of low scale supersymmetry, determines the GUT scale and, in combination with constraints from proton decay experiments, one is able to constrain some of the key parameters in this setup. The breaking of $SO(10)$ via $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ also yields superheavy metastable strings with no unconfined flux associated with the monopoles. Finally, we consider $SO(10)$ breaking via $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$, $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ and flipped $SU(5)$ that yield metastable strings where the associated monopoles carry unconfined flux after the electroweak breaking.</description>

      <title>Spectral Intruders: A Multi-Site Study of Radio Environment for Cosmology Experiments</title>

Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) presents a significant challenge for carrying out precision measurements in radio astronomy. In particular, RFI can be a show stopper when looking for faint cosmological signals such as the red-shifted 21-cm line from cosmic dawn (CD) and epoch of reionization (EoR). As wireless communications, satellite transmissions, and other RF technologies proliferate globally, understanding the RFI landscape has become essential for site selection and data integrity. We present findings from RFI surveys conducted at four distinct locations: three locations in India, the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory in Karnataka, Twin Lakes in Ladakh, Kalpong Dam in the Andaman Islands, and the Gruvebadet Atmosphere Laboratory in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway. These sites, selected based on their geographical diversity and varying levels of human activity, were studied to assess RFI presence in 30-300 MHz bands-critical for low-frequency observations and experiments targeting the 21-cm CD/EoR signal. Using an automated RFI detection approach via the Hampel filter and singular value decomposition, the surveys identified both persistent and transient interference, which varies with location and time. The results provide a comprehensive view of the RFI environment at each site, informing the feasibility of long-term cosmological observations and aiding in the mitigation of RFI in radio astronomical data. The methods developed to characterize RFI can be easily generalized to any location and experiment.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Chern-Simons invariant in non-metricity gravity and axion cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a pseudo-scalar quantity, which is an analogue of the Chern-Simons invariant, in the framework of non-metricity gravity. By considering the coupling between the pseudo-scalar quantity and the axion, we give scenarios which may solve the problems of the axion misalignment, the $S_8$ problem, and the beginning of inflation. When the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory or grand unified theories (GUTs) occurs, the pseudo-scalar quantity has a non-trivial value, which induces the misalignment of the axion field and axion particles are produced. If the gradient of the potential is small, the $S_8$ problem might be solved. We also propose a mechanism which induces inflation by the misalignment of the axion field generated by the phase transition of the GUTs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a high-velocity cloud of the Milky Way as a potential dark galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are composed of neutral hydrogen (HI) moving at velocities that deviate from the general rotational motion of the Milky Way. Currently, the origins of the HVCs remain poorly known due to the difficulty in determining their distance and the lack of any other suitable identification. Here we report the detection of a compact gas clump in HVC AC-I, which displays characteristics typical of a disk galaxy, named AC G185.0-11.5, using the HI observations. We estimated the distance of AC G185.0-11.5 to be about 277.7 kpc using the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and constrained its HI gas mass to be between 3.0*10^7 and 4.7*10^8 solar masses. The distance determination indicates that the HVC AC-I hosting AC G185.0-11.5 is an extragalactic object in the Local Group. The absence of molecular gas and an optical counterpart for AC G185.0-11.5 implies that it may be a rare dark galaxy.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Dark Matter Search with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel modification to the optical benches of space-based gravitational wave detectors (SGWDs) to enable the detection of axion-like dark matter (ALDM)-induced birefringence without altering the polarization of inter-spacecraft laser links. Our design introduces an auxiliary interferometer to convert polarization modulation into measurable phase shifts. Analytical expressions for sensitivity to the ALDM-photon coupling are derived for various time-delay interferometry (TDI) combinations. Projected sensitivity curves demonstrate complementary coverage across the ALDM mass range $10^{-19}\sim10^{-14}\mathrm{eV}$. This approach preserves the original interferometric stability while enabling new physics capabilities for SGWDs.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations between X-ray clusters and the general galaxy population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents highly precise measurements of the cross-correlation between volume-limited galaxy samples from the DESI legacy survey catalogue and X-ray selected galaxy clusters from eROSITA, allowing for detailed analysis across redshift and color. Two key findings emerge. First, the cluster-galaxy cross-correlation, when split into quiescent and star-forming galaxies, contains significant information about the infall, feedback, and quenching processes of blue cloud galaxies in massive environments. These results align well with existing galaxy evolution models for higher stellar masses ($\log_{10}(M^*[M_\odot]) &gt; 10.75$), though the red fraction may be slightly underestimated in the intermediate mass range ($10.25 &lt; \log_{10}(M^*[M_\odot])&lt; 10.75$). Second, the integral of the cross-correlation within 500 kpc enables a model-independent measurement of the red sequence and its scatter in clusters, providing a robust alternative to existing red-sequence calibration methods without requiring spectroscopic redshifts or classifications of galaxies. Similar analyses on upcoming photometric surveys as Euclid and LSST together with spectroscopic samples like 4MOST and DESI should lead to a significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio and in particular at small separations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We put into test the idea of replacing dark energy by a vector field against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation using the simplest vector-tensor theory, where a massive vector field couples to the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor quadratically. First, a remarkable Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric solution that is completely independent of the matter-energy compositions of the universe is found. Second, based on the FLRW solution as well as the perturbation equations, a numerical code calculating the CMB temperature power spectrum is built. We find that though the FLRW solution can mimic the evolution of the universe in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the calculated CMB temperature power spectrum shows unavoidable discrepancies from the CMB power spectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy in the FLRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute a holographic entanglement entropy via Ryu--Takayanagi prescription in the three-dimensional Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe. We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the static patch holography and the half de Sitter holography, in which the holographic boundary is timelike and placed in the bulk. We find in general that the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in addition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. Also, for the universe filled with an ideal fluid of constant equation of state $w&lt;-1$, the condition is sharpened as that the holographic boundary has to fit inside the event horizon instead. These conditions provide a necessary condition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with the strong subadditivity.</description>

      <title>False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer and time-averaged observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ATC) has recently released new measurements and constraints on inflationary observables. In this paper it is shown that a component of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric, can easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such geometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal model, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its running $\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide an inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy density are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the potential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. The role of the Higgs boson during and after inflation is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent effects on global 21-cm detection</title>

Abstract: Cosmic dawn represents critical juncture in cosmic history when the first population of stars emerged. The astrophysical processes that govern this transformation need to be better understood. The detection of redshifted 21-cm radiation emitted from neutral hydrogen during this era offers a direct window into the thermal and ionization state of the universe. This emission manifests as differential brightness between spin temperature and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). SARAS experiment aims to detect the sky-averaged signal in the frequency range 40-200 MHz. SARAS's unique design and operation strategy to float the antenna over a water body minimizes spectral features that may arise due to stratified ground beneath the antenna. However, the antenna environment can be prone to configuration changes due to variations in critical design parameters such as conductivity and antenna tilts. In this paper, we connect the variations in antenna properties to signal detection prospects. By using realistic simulations of a direction and frequency-dependent radiation pattern of the SARAS antenna and its transfer function, we establish critical parameters and estimate bias in the detectability of different models of the global 21-cm signal. We find a correlation between the nature of chromaticity in antenna properties and the bias in the recovered spectral profiles of 21-cm signals. We also find stringent requirements for transfer function corrections, which can otherwise make detection prospects prohibitive. We finally explore a range of critical parameters that allow robust signal detection.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dark siren cosmology through multi-band gravitational wave synergetic observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-band gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations are poised to herald a new era in the study of cosmic evolution. These observations offer higher signal-to-noise ratios and improved localizations compared to those achieved with single-band GW detection, which are crucial for the cosmological applications of dark sirens. In this work, we explore the role multi-band GW synergetic observations will play in measuring cosmological parameters, particularly in comparison with single GW observatory data. We used mock multi-band dark siren data from third-generation GW detectors and the baseline Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory to infer cosmological parameters. Our analysis shows that multi-band GW observations significantly improve sky localization accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude over single-band observations, although their impact on luminosity distance error remains limited. This results in a substantial improvement in the constraints on matter density and the Hubble constant, enhancing their constraint precision by $60\%$-$90\%$ and $52\%$-$85\%$, respectively. We conclude that the significant potential of multi-band GW synergistic observations for detecting GW signals and resolving the Hubble tension is highly promising and warrants anticipation.</description>

      <title>COBRA: Optimal Factorization of Cosmological Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce COBRA (Cosmology with Optimally factorized Bases of Radial Approximants), a novel framework for rapid computation of large-scale structure observables. COBRA separates scale dependence from cosmological parameters in the linear matter power spectrum while also minimising the number of necessary basis terms $N_b$, thus enabling direct and efficient computation of derived and nonlinear observables. Moreover, the dependence on cosmological parameters is efficiently approximated using radial basis function interpolation. We apply our framework to decompose the linear matter power spectrum in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario, as well as by adding curvature, dynamical dark energy and massive neutrinos, covering all redshifts relevant for Stage IV surveys. With only a dozen basis terms $N_b$, COBRA reproduces exact Boltzmann solver calculations to $\sim 0.1\%$ precision, which improves further to $0.02\%$ in the pure $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Using our decomposition, we recast the one-loop redshift space galaxy power spectrum in a separable minimal-basis form, enabling $\sim 4000$ model evaluations per second at $0.02\%$ precision on a single thread. This constitutes a considerable improvement over previously existing methods (e.g., FFTLog) opening a window for efficient computations of higher loop and higher order correlators involving multiple powers of the linear matter power spectra. The resulting factorisation can also be utilised in clustering, weak lensing and CMB analyses. Our implementation will be made public upon publication.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

      <title>Massive $\nu$s through the CNN lens: interpreting the field-level neutrino mass information in weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cosmological surveys probe the Universe deep into the nonlinear regime, where massive neutrinos suppress cosmic structure. Traditional cosmological analyses, which use the 2-point correlation function to extract information, are no longer optimal in the nonlinear regime, and there is thus much interest in extracting beyond-2-point information to improve constraints on neutrino mass. Quantifying and interpreting the beyond-2-point information is thus a pressing task. We study the field-level information in weak lensing convergence maps using convolution neural networks. We find that the network performance increases as higher source redshifts and smaller scales are considered -- investigating up to a source redshift of 2.5 and $\ell_{\rm max}\simeq10^4$ -- verifying that massive neutrinos leave a distinct effect on weak lensing. However, the performance of the network significantly drops after scaling out the 2-point information from the maps, implying that most of the field-level information can be found in the 2-point correlation function alone. We quantify these findings in terms of the likelihood ratio and also use Integrated Gradient saliency maps to interpret which parts of the map the network is learning the most from. We find that, in the absence of noise, the network extracts a similar amount of information from the most overdense and underdense regions. However, upon adding noise, the information in underdense regions is distorted as noise disproportionately washes out void-like structures.</description>

Our two-loop calculation includes both the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the inflaton perturbation $\delta\phi$ and the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear relation between the latter and the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$, which we find to be subdominant with respect to the former. We apply our formalism to an analytical model in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is followed by a constant-roll stage with a nonvanishing second slow-roll parameter $\eta$, and address the renormalization of the one-loop scalar power spectrum in this scenario.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which modifying the ionization history at cosmological recombination can relieve the Hubble tension, taking into account all relevant datasets and considering the implications for the galaxy clustering parameter $S_8$ and the matter density fraction $\Omega_m$. We use the linear response approximation to systematically search for candidate ionization histories parameterized with a cubic-spline that provide good fits to the Planck CMB and DESI BAO data while relieving the $H_0$ tension, followed by MCMC fits of the most promising candidate models to the data. We also fit to the data a physically motivated phenomenological model of ionization history that has four parameters. Our main result is that models of modified recombination can reduce the Hubble tension to below 2$\sigma$ while improving the fit to the current CMB and BAO data and reducing the $S_8$ tension. The promising candidate ionization histories have simple shapes, with no need for an oscillatory dependence on redshift. Our study also demonstrates the importance of the high-resolution CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies for constraining modified recombination, with the candidate models in this study showing varying levels of agreement with the current ACT DR4 and SPT-3G data.</description>

      <title>SZ-X-ray Surface Brightness Fluctuations in the SPT-XMM clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot plasma in galaxy clusters, the intracluster medium (ICM), is expected to be shaped by subsonic turbulent motions, which are key for heating, cooling, and transport mechanisms. The turbulent motions contribute to the non-thermal pressure which, if not accounted for, consequently imparts a hydrostatic mass bias. Accessing information about turbulent motions is thus of major astrophysical and cosmological interest. Characteristics of turbulent motions can be indirectly accessed through surface brightness fluctuations. This study expands on our pilot investigations of surface brightness fluctuations in the SZ and X-ray by examining, for the first time, a large sample of 60 clusters using \textit{both} SPT-SZ and XMM-Newton data and span the redshift range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, thus constraining the respective pressure and density fluctuations within 0.6~$R_{500}$. We deem density fluctuations to be of sufficient quality for 32 clusters, finding mild correlations between the peak of the amplitude spectra of density fluctuations and various dynamical parameters. We infer turbulent velocities from density fluctuations with an average Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\text{3D}} = 0.52 \pm 0.14$, in agreement with numerical simulations. For clusters with inferred turbulent Mach numbers from both pressure, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$ and density fluctuations, $\mathcal{M}_{\rho}$, we find broad agreement between $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\rho}$. Our results suggest either a bimodal or skewed unimodal Mach number distribution, with the majority of clusters being turbulence-dominated (subsonic) while the remainder are shock-dominated (supersonic).</description>

      <title>Scalar-Tensor Gravity and DESI 2024 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the implications of the DESI 2024 BAO data on scalar-tensor models of gravity. We consider four representative models: induced gravity (IG, equivalent to Jordan-Brans-Dicke), where we either fix today's value of the effective gravitational constant on cosmological scales to the Newton's constant or allow them to differ, Jordan-Brans-Dicke supplemented with a Galileon term (BDG), and early modified gravity (EMG) with a conformal coupling. In this way it is possible to investigate how different modified gravity models compare with each other when confronted with DESI 2024 BAO data. Compared to previous analyses, for all of these models, the combination of Planck and DESI data favors a larger value of the key parameter of the theory, such as the nonminimal coupling to gravity or the Galileon term, leading also to a larger value of $H_0$, due to the known degeneracy between these parameters. These new results are mainly driven by the first two redshift bins of DESI. In BDG, in which we find the largest value for $H_0$ among the models considered, the combination of Planck and DESI is consistent with CCHP results and reduces the $H_0$ tension with the SH0ES measurement to $1.2\sigma$ (compared to $4.5\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM in our Planck + DESI analysis).</description>

      <title>Field-level inference of $H_0$ from simulated type Ia supernovae in a local Universe analogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two particular challenges face type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) as probes of the expansion rate of the Universe. One is that they may not be fair tracers of the matter velocity field, and the second is that their peculiar velocities distort the Hubble expansion. Although the latter has been estimated at $\lesssim1.5\%$ for $z&gt;0.023$, this is based either on constrained linear or unconstrained (random) non-linear velocity simulations. In this paper, we address both challenges by incorporating a physical model for the locations of supernovae, and develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model that accounts for non-linear peculiar velocities in our local Universe, inferred from a Bayesian analysis of the 2M++ spectroscopic galaxy catalogue. With simulated data, the model recovers the ground truth value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the presence of peculiar velocities including their correlated uncertainties arising from the Bayesian inference, opening up the potential of including lower redshift SNeIa to measure $H_0$. Ignoring peculiar velocities, the inferred $H_0$ increases minimally by $\sim 0.4 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the range $0.023&lt;z&lt;0.046$. We conclude it is unlikely that the $H_0$ tension originates in unaccounted-for non-linear velocity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Constraining the effective field theory of dark energy with multimessenger astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory of dark energy predicts a possible time variation of the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GW) which could be tested with multimessenger astronomy.For this purpose we derive the relation between the redshift dependence of the propagation speed of GWs and the time delay between the detection of GWs and electromagnetic waves (EMWs) emitted by the same source. According to the EFT the friction term of the GW propagation equation depends on the effective Planck mass and GW speed time variation, affecting the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio.
  We compute the general form of the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio in terms of the effective GW speed and effective Planck mass, and then focus on theories with constant Planck mass (CPM) and time varying GW speed. For CPM theories the GW speed can be jointly constrained by the GW-EMW detection time delay and luminosity distance ratio, allowing to derive a consistency relation between these two observables. The event GW170817 and its EM counterpart satisfy the CPM consistency condition, and allows to set constraints on the time variation of the GWs speed, and consequently on the coefficients of the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Negative pressure as a quantum effect in free-streaming in the cosmological background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of energy density and pressure of a free real scalar quantum field after its decoupling from a thermal bath in the spatially flat Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker space-time by solving the Klein-Gordon equation both analytically and numerically for different predetermined scale factor functions $a(t)$. The energy density and pressure, defined by subtracting the vacuum expectation values at the decoupling time, feature corrections with respect to the classical free-streaming solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. We show that if the expansion rate is comparable or larger than $mc^2/\hbar$ or $KT_0/\hbar$ where $m$ is the mass and $T_0$ the decoupling temperature, both energy density and pressure gets strong quantum corrections which substantially modify their classical dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ and drive pressure to large negative values. For a minimally coupled field with a very low mass in an expanding de Sitter universe quantum corrections are dominant driving pressure and energy density to become asymptotically constant with an equation of state $p/\varepsilon \simeq -1$, thereby mimicking a cosmological constant. For a minimally coupled massless field, quantum corrections are asymptotically dominant for any accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies (by $\sim 1$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases) compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.</description>

Abstract: The NEWS-G direct detection experiment uses spherical proportional counters to search for light dark matter candidates. New results from a 10 day physics run with a $135\,\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter spherical proportional counter at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane are reported. The target consists of $114\,\mathrm{g}$ of methane, providing sensitivity to dark matter spin-dependent coupling to protons. New constraints are presented in the mass range $0.17$ to $1.2\,\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$, with a 90% confidence level cross-section upper limit of $30.9\,\mathrm{pb}$ for a mass of $0.76\,\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quartic-divergent vacuum energy poses an ultraviolet (UV) challenge (the cosmological constant problem) in probing the nature of dark energy. Here we try to evaluate the contribution of the vacuum energy to dark energy with a method of the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Then, we propose an effective description via scale decoupling. The parameter spaces suggest that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal ordering neutrinos are preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Phase-space analysis of dark energy models in non-minimally coupled theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze scalar field dark energy models minimally and non-minimally coupled to gravity, postulating that a Yukawa-like interacting term is \emph{in form} equivalent for general relativity, teleparallel and symmetric-teleparallel theories. Our analysis is pursued within two scalar field representations, where a quintessence and phantom pictures are associated with quasiquintessence and quasiphantom exotic fields. In the latter, we suggest how the phion-pressure can be built up without exhibiting a direct kinetic term. Accordingly, the stability analysis reveals that this quasiquintessence field provides a viable description of the universe indicating, when minimally coupled, how to unify dark energy and dark matter by showing an attractor point where $w_{\phi}=0$. Conversely, in the non-minimally coupling, the alternative field only leaves an attractor where dark energy dominates, mimicking \emph{de facto} a cosmological constant behavior. A direct study is conducted comparing the standard case with the alternative one, overall concluding that the behavior of quintessence is well established across all the gravity scenarios. However, considering the phantom field non-minimal coupled to gravity, the results are inconclusive for power-law potentials in Einstein theory, and for the inverse square power (ISP) potential in both teleparallel and symmetric-teleparallel theories. Finally, we study the growth of matter perturbations and establish that only the fifth power and quadratic potentials, when used to describe quasiphantom field minimally coupled to gravity, exhibit behavior similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of microlensed gravitational waves with Conditional Variational Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) provides a unique opportunity to study cosmology and astrophysics at multiple scales. Detecting microlensing signatures, in particular, requires efficient parameter estimation methods due to the high computational cost of traditional Bayesian inference. In this paper we explore the use of deep learning, namely Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), to estimate parameters of microlensed binary black hole (simulated) waveforms. We find that our CVAE model yields accurate parameter estimation and significant computational savings compared to Bayesian methods such as Bilby (up to five orders of magnitude faster inferences). Moreover, the incorporation of CVAE-generated priors into Bilby, based on the 95% confidence intervals of the CVAE posterior for the lensing parameters, reduces Bilby's average runtime by around 48% without any penalty on accuracy. Our results suggest that a CVAE model is a promising tool for future low-latency searches of lensed signals. Further applications to actual signals and integration with advanced pipelines could help extend the capabilities of GW observatories in detecting microlensing events.</description>

Abstract: DWs represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of GWs produced by scalar perturbations generated from the DW network. Our findings indicate that the GW spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future GW experiments aimed at exploring the role of DWs in the early universe.</description>

Starting from Synge's Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a position-space action and use it perturbatively to calculate light bending angles. In the homogeneous case, the action reduces to that of a massive particle, allowing us to extract the bending angle of light in the presence of the medium using a well-known analogy. For the inhomogeneous case, we consider a power law model and construct Feynman rules in time to compute the purely plasma-induced corrections to the bending angle at Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO).</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field, which admits viable solutions of bouncing universe satisfying the following requirements: (i) absence of Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) instability, ghost and gradient instability, (ii) absence of superluminality, (iii) generation of nearly scale-invariant curvature perturbations and very small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and (iv) conventional asymptotics in the distant past and future, where gravity sector is described by General Relativity and the DHOST scalar has a canonical form of Lagrangian. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the cosmological evolution parameters, energy conditions, and linear matter perturbations of an exponential-type model in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological evolution in a flat FLRW spacetime in the context of modified STEGR gravity or $f(Q)$, using an exponential two-parameter model which represents a smooth perturbative expansion around the $\Lambda$CDM model. The cosmological analysis is carried out by calculating the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, for selected values of the parameters. The Hubble parameter is obtained analytically by means of several approximations good enough to deviate slightly from the $\Lambda$CDM case. Several late-time cosmological parameters are computed, such as: dark energy state parameter, deceleration parameter, statefinder parameters. Additionally, we analyzed the behavior of the classical energy conditions WEC, SEC, NEC, and DEC for both the combination of matter and geometrical contribution and the geometrical contribution alone. Beyond the background level, linear matter perturbations are studied by calculating parameters relevant to structure growth and formation. The overall results indicate that the model may exhibit quintessence-like and phantom-like behavior and it impacts the growth of structures in the universe by means late-time deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal gravity in a proper tetrad frame: traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity involving four auxiliary scalar fields, introduced to explain the standard cosmological background expansion history without fine-tuning issues. In particular, we simplify the complex field equations within a proper tetrad frame, thereby recasting the original system into a more tractable equivalent differential problem. We show that, by initially postulating the form of the $g_{tt}$ metric component, it is possible to reconstruct the distortion function of the gravitational model. We then describe a step-by-step procedure for solving the vacuum field equations in the case of a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We apply our technique to find new traversable wormholes supported purely by gravity by employing either analytical, perturbative, or numerical methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the role of the nonlocal effects is analogous to that of exotic matter in general relativity, owing to their quantum nature. Finally, we discuss the main geometric properties of the obtained solutions. Our results present a feasible avenue for identifying novel compact objects while enhancing the comprehension of nonlocal gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</description>
