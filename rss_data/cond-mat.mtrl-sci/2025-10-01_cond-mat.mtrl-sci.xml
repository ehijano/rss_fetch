      <title>Mechanisms of Matter: Language Inferential Benchmark on Physicochemical Hypothesis in Materials Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate valid scientific hypotheses for materials synthesis remains largely unquantified, hindered by the absence of benchmarks probing physicochemical logics reasoning. To address this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science. The MatterMech benchmark and associated code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/amair-lab/MatterMech}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency Pt75Au25-based spintronic terahertz emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband THz radiation via ultrafast spin-charge conversion in magnetic multilayers, offering spectral coverage beyond that of photoconductive antennas and nonlinear optical crystals. Here, we demonstrate a new type of STE based on PtxAu100-x alloy that achieves signifi- cantly higher THz output power than widely used Pt-based devices. Alloy composition and layer thickness tuning yield Pt75Au25 as the optimal alloy providing a 30 % increase in THz power in CoFeB/Pt75Au25 bilayer STEs compared to the optimized CoFeB/Pt reference STE. In W/CoFeB/Pt75Au25 trilayer STEs, we observe a 10 % higher THz power than in the optimized W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer. The STE efficiency is reduced upon annealing for both Pt75Au25- and Pt-based STEs due to formation of interfacial alloys. Our results establish Pt75Au25 as a promising platform for high-performance STEs, where its giant spin Hall effect significantly enhances efficiency over conventional Pt-based devices.</description>

      <title>Design Principles for Topological Thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional metals, insulators, and semimetals are constrained by fundamental limitations in terms of their thermoelectric performance. Topological materials offer certain features that allow them to circumvent these constraints, and potentially to form the basis for thermoelectric devices with unprecedented efficiency. In this article we review the thermoelectric performance of topological materials, focusing specifically on nodal semimetals, such as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. We discuss how certain unique ``topological'' features of these materials -- namely their topologically protected band touching points, electron-hole degenerate lowest Landau level, and Berry curvature -- allow them to exhibit thermoelectric properties that go beyond what is possible in conventional materials, particularly in the presence of an applied magnetic field. We focus our discussion on the goal of achieving large figure of merit $zT$, and for each material class we summarize optimal \emph{design principles} for selecting materials that maximize thermoelectric efficiency.
  We then use these optimal design principles to design and implement a high-throughput database search for topological semimetals that are promising as thermoelectrics. In addition to highlighting a number of materials that are already known to have large magnetothermoelectric effects, our search uncovers twelve additional materials that are especially promising for near-future experiments.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Monte Carlo prediction of the morphology of pentaerythritol tetranitrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an atomistic, graph-based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation routine to predict crystal morphology. Within this routine, we encode the state of the supercell in a binary occupation vector and the topology of the supercell in a simple nearest-neighbor graph. From this encoding, we efficiently compute the interaction energy of the system as a quadratic form of the binary occupation vector, representing pairwise interactions. This encoding, coupled with a simple diffusion model for adsorption, is then used to model evaporation and adsorption dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces. The resulting intermolecular interaction-breaking energies are incorporated into a kinetic model to predict crystal morphology, which is implemented in the open-source Python package Crystal Growth Kinetic Monte Carlo (cgkmc). We then apply this routine to pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), an important energetic material, showing excellent agreement with the attachment energy model.</description>

      <title>Spin and Orbital Edelstein effect in gated monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Edelstein effect consists of the non-equilibrium accumulation of magnetization in response to an applied electric field in systems with broken inversion symmetry. While the spin Edelstein effect (SEE), originating from spin moments, is well established, its orbital counterpart, where magnetization arises from orbital moment, has only recently begun to attract attention. In this work, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) in gated monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, by using first-principles density-functional calculations with both electron and hole doping. The gate-induced broken mirror symmetry produces a Rashba-type chiral spin/orbital angular momentum texture, which in turn leads to the Edelstein effect in response to an applied in-plane electric field. We find that for electron doping the Edelstein response is dominated by the orbital channel, whereas for hole doping the orbital and spin contributions are comparable. For the case of hole doping, both OEE and SEE are strongly enhanced by a small amount of strain, due to strain-driven shifts between the Gamma and K/K' valley energies. We derive analytical expressions for the spin and orbital Edelstein susceptibilities and evaluate their magnitudes from first-principles. Remarkably, the predicted OEE in gated monolayer TMDs is an order of magnitude larger than values reported in previously studied systems. Our results identify TMDs as promising platforms for studying the orbital Edelstein effect and highlight their potential applications in spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Lithium depth profiling in NMC/Graphite commercial coin cells under high C-rate cycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines lithium distribution and its evolution in both anode and cathode materials of commercial lithium-ion coin cells subjected to high C-rate cycling, providing insights into lithium loss, trapping, and plating mechanisms. Cells were cycled at 1C to 3C rates, and post-mortem analysis were performed using Li nuclear reaction Analysis (Li-NRA), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Li-NRA using the resonant nuclear reaction between an incident high-energy proton and lithium was used to measure the depth distribution of Li in the cathode and anode layers. The Li-NRA analysis revealed a surface lithium peak on the anode, likely associated with SEI formation and lithium plating, while the cathode exhibited a decrease in lithium content by ~19.7%. XRD analysis of the cathode showed a contraction of the c-lattice parameter and peak shifts consistent with lithium depletion and structural deformation, supported by SEM imaging. In contrast, the dead graphite anode shows an enhanced peak at 43.3{\deg}, which corresponds to the presence of metallic lithium or possibly Cu. 3-C rate cycling also led to capacity fade and an increase in internal resistance, highlighting the impact of lithium plating on cell performance.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting Organic Molecules for the Inverse Design of Two-Dimensional Hybrid Perovskites with Target Energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted workflows have transformed materials discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical spaces of functional materials. Endowed with extraordinary optoelectronic properties, two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites represent an exciting frontier, but current efforts to design 2D perovskites rely heavily on trial-and-error and expert intuition approaches, leaving most of the chemical space unexplored and compromising the design of hybrid materials with desired properties. Here, we introduce an inverse design workflow for Dion-Jacobson perovskites that is built on an invertible fingerprint representation for millions of conjugated diammonium organic spacers. By incorporating high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, interpretable machine learning, and synthesis feasibility screening, we identified new organic spacer candidates with deterministic energy level alignment between the organic and the inorganic motifs in the 2D hybrid perovskites. These results highlight the power of integrating invertible, physically meaningful molecular representations into AI-assisted design, streamlining the property-targeted design of hybrid materials.</description>

      <title>Discovery of oxide Li-conducting electrolytes in uncharted chemical space via topology-constrained crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxide Li-conducting solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer excellent chemical and thermal stability but typically exhibit lower ionic conductivity than sulfides and chlorides. This motivates the search for new oxide materials with enhanced conductivity. Crystal structure prediction is a powerful approach for identifying such candidates. However, the structural complexity of oxide SSEs, often involving unit cells with more than 100 atoms, presents significant challenges for conventional methods. In this study, we introduce TOPIC, a structure prediction algorithm that reduces configurational complexity by enforcing corner-sharing (CS) bond topology constraints. We demonstrate that TOPIC successfully reproduces the ground-state and metastable structures of known oxide SSEs, including LiTa$_2$PO$_8$ and Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, which contain up to about 200 atoms per unit cell. By combining this approach with a pretrained machine-learning interatomic potential, we systematically screen quaternary oxide compositions and identify 92 promising candidates with CS frameworks. In particular, Li$_4$Hf$_2$Si$_3$O$_{12}$, which corresponds to the ground state at its composition, exhibits an ionic conductivity of 14 mS cm$^{-1}$, a hull energy of 21 meV atom$^{-1}$, and a band gap of 6.5 eV. Through our investigation, we identify the Li ratio as one of the key factors determining the stability of CS structures. Overall, our approach provides a practical and scalable pathway for discovering high-performance oxide solid electrolytes in previously unexplored chemical spaces.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Bulk-oriented Universal Interatomic Potentials for Surfaces: Accuracy, Efficiency, and Forgetting Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of surface energies and stabilities is essential for materials design, yet first-principles calculations remain computationally expensive and most existing interatomic potentials are trained only on bulk systems. Here, we demonstrate that fine-tuning foundation machine learning potentials (MLPs) significantly improves both computational efficiency and predictive accuracy for surface modeling. While existing universal interatomic potentials (UIPs) have been solely trained and validated on bulk datasets, we extend their applicability to complex and scientifically significant unary, binary, and ternary surface systems. We systematically compare models trained from scratch, zero-shot inference, conventional fine-tuning, and multi-head fine-tuning approach that enhances transferability and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Fine-tuning consistently reduces prediction errors with orders-of-magnitude fewer training configurations, and multi-head fine-tuning delivers robust and generalizable predictions even for materials beyond the initial training domain. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging pre-trained MLPs to accelerate surface modeling and highlight a scalable path toward data-efficient, next-generation atomic-scale simulations in computational materials science.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of the photochromic effect in oxygen-containing rare-earth hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetics of the photochromic reaction of oxygen-containing rare-earth hydrides is commonly described by an exponential function assuming a single-step process. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of the photochromic effect in oxygen-containing rare-earth metal hydrides, considering the kinetics of the reaction as a two-step process. We show that the fit to the experimental data is improved drastically when two processes that cause the photodarkening are assumed: a fast reaction rate-limited - for example, electronic or local - process and a slow, e.g. diffusion-limited process.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Antiparallel Domains in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) supports a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) technologies, yet assessing its crystalline quality over large areas remains a fundamental challenge. Both antiparallel domains, an intrinsic outcome of epitaxy on high-symmetry substrates, and orientational domains have long evaded optical detection. Here, we show that interferometric second-harmonic generation (SHG) polarimetry provides a powerful, non-destructive probe of lattice orientation and structural integrity in chemical vapor deposition-grown hBN. This approach reveals the ubiquitous formation of antiparallel domains and quantifies their impact on crystalline order. SHG intensity also emerges as a direct optical metric of domain disorder, spanning three orders of magnitude across films produced by ten different growth routes. Correlation with Raman spectroscopy establishes a unified framework for evaluating crystalline quality. Beyond hBN, this method offers a high-throughput route to wide-area structural imaging in other non-centrosymmetric 2D materials, advancing their deployment in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of High-\k{appa} Oxides with Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</description>

      <title>Topological Textures in Zr-Substituted Barium Titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 fractional hotspots, termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized effective-Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3 quarks). The two share the same six-vortex skeleton but differ by an integer +1 per vortex in the plane-integrated slice charge. In random BZT, nanodomains remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass like state with fluctuations of the topological charge along the axis. Thermal stability maps show that pure BT retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the critical temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly, the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices.</description>

      <title>Exact heat flux formula and its spectral decomposition in molecular dynamics for arbitrary many-body potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we have derived an exact framework for the calculation of the heat flux and its spec- tral decomposition in Molecular Dynamics (MD) for arbitrary many-body potentials. This work addresses several lacks and limitations of previous approaches and allows for the accurate computa- tional study of thermal properties in a wide variety of many-body systems with MD. We have tested our modifications with Green-Kubo (GK) and Non-Equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations for vari- ous 2D and 3D material systems using the Tersoff and Stillinger-Weber potentials as examples. The spectral decomposition of the heat current was also calculated for monolayer graphene (1LG) and MoS2 , for different system lengths. Our results show that the heat current calculated by our method is consistently in agreement with the thermostat current in NEMD, while previous implementations can estimate quite poorly the thermal conductivity both under GK and NEMD simulations, and both for 2D and 3D materials. The decomposition of the heat current also sheds light on the con- tribution of different phonon modes to thermal conductivity and its dependence on length. Our methodology is implemented in the widely used LAMMPS code specifically for the Tersoff and SW potentials, and it is readily applicable to the vast majority of many-body MD potentials.</description>

      <title>Field-tuning of ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of spin fluctuations in antiferromagnets are largely unexplored, in particular at ultrafast timescales. Here, we employ femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) to experimentally study magnetization fluctuations in the canted antiferromagnet Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$ across its spin reorientation transition and under external magnetic fields. By comparing our measurements to atomistic spin noise and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the amplitude of the spin noise is governed by the free energy, with stronger fluctuations in regions where the potential landscape softens. We furthermore demonstrate that external magnetic fields suppress spin fluctuations and enhance the quasi-ferromagnetic magnon frequency by effectively stiffening the potential. These results highlight an effective route for tuning ultrafast magnetization fluctuations via external parameters.</description>

      <title>The diffusion-driven orthorhombic to tetragonal transition in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ derived with a machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in high temperature superconductors such as YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) critically influence their superconducting behavior, as they substantially degrade or even suppress superconductivity. With the renewed interest in cuprates for next-generation superconducting magnets operating in radiation-harsh environments such as fusion reactors and particle accelerators, accurate atomistic modeling of defects and their dynamics has become essential. Here, we present a general-purpose machine-learning interatomic potential for YBCO, based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) method and trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data, with particular emphasis on defects and their diffusion mechanisms. The potential is validated against DFT calculations of ground-state properties, defect formation energies of oxygen Frenkel pairs and diffusion barriers for their formation. Remarkably, the potential captures the diffusion-driven orthorhombic to tetragonal transition at elevated temperatures, a transformation that is difficult to describe with empirical potentials, elucidating how the formation of oxygen Frenkel pairs in the basal plane governs this order-disorder transition. The ACE potential introduced here enables large-scale, predictive atomistic simulations of defect dynamics and transport processes in YBCO, providing a powerful tool to explore its stability, performance, and functionality under realistic operating conditions. Moreover, this work proves that machine learning interatomic potentials are suitable for studies of quaternary oxides with complex chemistry.</description>

      <title>Towards stable metal inorganic-organic complex glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) glasses have emerged as a new family of melt-quenched glasses. However, the vitrification of MIOC is challenging since most of the crystalline MIOC precursors decompose before melting. The decomposition problem severely narrows the compositional range of MIOC glass formation. Here, we report a novel approach for preparing the MIOC glasses that combines slow-solvent-removal with subsequent quenching to avoid gel thermal decomposition and crystallization. Specifically, the new approach utilizes an aprotic solvent (acetone) to kinetically prevent the ordering of the metal-ligand complex molecules in solution, thereby suppressing crystallization and forming a gel. The subsequent gradual drying process leads to the removal of the solvent to enhance the connections between molecules through hydrogen bonds, thus causing the formation of a hydrogen-bonded network. The increased network connectivity lowers the mobility of the molecules, thereby avoiding gel crystallization. Consequently, a disordered network is frozen-in during quenching of the dried gel from 130 {\deg}C to room temperature, and finally MIOC glass forms. Structural analyses reveal that hydrogen bonds are responsible for connecting the tetrahedral units. The as-prepared MIOC glass exhibits some fascinating behaviors, e.g., Tg increasing with rapid room-temperature relaxation, CO2 uptake, and red-shift of photoluminescence. This work not only presents a novel strategy for fabricating large-sized, stable, functional MIOC glasses, but also uncovers the critical role of hydrogen bonds in MIOC glass formation.</description>

      <title>MoSe2 and WSe2 shell morphology control via temperature optimization during two-step growth of ZnSe-based core-shell nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving uniform and controlled transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) shell growth on nanowires (NWs) remains a key challenge, limiting the development of high-quality core-shell heterostructures for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications. In this work, the fabrication of ZnSe-MoSe2 and ZnSe-WSe2 core-shell NWs was successfully demonstrated. ZnSe NWs were grown via the vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism, while TMD (MoSe2 or WSe2) shells were formed through a two-step process of sacrificial oxide layer deposition via magnetron sputtering followed by selenization process in a chemical vapor transport reactor. As-grown nanostructures were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It was observed that the TMD shell morphology can be controlled through the selenization process temperature optimization, which arises due to different growth mechanisms discussed here. The studied trends could be further extended to other semiconductor NW and TMD core-shell heterostructure growth, offering promising avenues for advanced nanoscale applications.</description>

      <title>Strain-Gradient-Driven Decoupling of Thermal Suppression from Anisotropy in \b{eta}-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain gradients, ubiquitous in flexible devices and epitaxial nanostructures, are a major blind spot for thermal transport in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. We establish that strain gradient unlocks a thermal conductivity (k) suppression mechanism fundamentally more potent than uniform strain: moderate uniaxial gradients (0.6%/nm) suppress k by 32-37% (27-30%) in thin films (nanowires), intensifying to 43.3% with biaxial gradients. This reduction far exceeds that from equivalent uniform strain and surpasses benchmark materials like silicon and BAs. Critically, a surprising decoupling emerges: while 3% uniform strain alters thermal anisotropy by ~25%, strain gradient strongly suppresses k with preserving this ratio. Mechanistically, strain gradients-induced symmetry breaking and enhanced mode coupling anisotropically activate forbidden scattering channels, making gradient-driven scattering dominant over intrinsic phonon scattering below 6.25 THz. These findings redefine non-uniform strain from a parasitic flaw into a powerful design tool for engineering thermal isolation and heat flux in next-generation flexible and high-power \b{eta}-Ga2O3 electronics.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of spin dynamics excitation by magnetic field of a high-frequency electromagnetic pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulses offer a promising route for the ultrafast manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic materials. While previous studies have demonstrated the excitation of spin dynamics using linearly polarized THz fields, the role of circular polarization and the effects of rapidly oscillating, time-dependent field profiles remained insufficiently understood. We have developed a unified theoretical framework for describing the excitation of spin precession via Zeeman interaction in magnetic materials by high frequency pulses of arbitrary polarization with temporal Gaussian profile. In the regime of long pulses (at least several oscillations are within the pulse duration), a circularly polarized magnetic field acts as an effective rectified magnetic field along the pulse propagation, while linear polarized pulses excite no free precession. In the regime of short pulses (less than one oscillation is within the pulse duration), pulses of any polarization, including linear one can excite free spin precession. There is an optimal pulse duration which maximizes amplitude of the spin precession. It depends on magnetic parameters of the sample and the external magnetic field, as well as on the carrier frequency of the pulse and its amplitude. These findings bridge key gaps in the understanding of THz-induced spin dynamics and provide insights into the design of light-controlled magnetization schemes using tailored electromagnetic pulses.</description>

      <title>Automated and Scalable SEM Image Analysis of Perovskite Solar Cell Materials via a Deep Segmentation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i) Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing; and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is available at:https://github.com/wlyyj/PerovSegNet/tree/master.</description>

      <title>Effect of Mixed Ratios of Mangosteen Peel (Garcinia mangostana L.) and Grass Jelly Leaf (Cyclea barbata L. Miers) Natural Dyes on the Performance of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising low-cost and environmentally friendly photovoltaic devices, especially when utilizing natural sensitizers. This study explores the effect of concentration ratios of natural dyes extracted from mangosteen peel (MP) and grass jelly leaves (GJL) on the optical, morphological, and photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. Dye solutions were prepared at a fixed concentration of 0.6 g/mL, with the MP:GJL volume ratio varied at 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. As a result, UV-Vis absorption spectra showed that the MP contributes to the UV-blue region (350-450), while the GJL contributes to the red region (650-700 nm). The current-voltage (J-V) analysis showed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MP and GJL dyes is 2.75% and 2.12%. The composite dye with a 1:3 (MP:GJL) ratio yielded the highest PCE of 3.50%, demonstrating the synergistic effect of combining these natural sensitizers to broaden the light absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</description>

      <title>Steering an Active Learning Workflow Towards Novel Materials Discovery via Queue Prioritization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces. We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604 high-performing candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric origins of the orbital degrees of freedom of hybrid bosonic quasiparticles in magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital degree of freedom has recently attracted significant attention due to the novel phenomena it enables in condensed matter systems. However, the interpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles remains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of orbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons and phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in bosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion of the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the latter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional antiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum geometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking, yielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM. We propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage generated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the bosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the emerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge between phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding magnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital degrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical control of magnetization and phononic transport.</description>

      <title>Charge Transfer States in Donor Acceptor Bulk Heterojunctions as Triplet Triplet Annihilation Sensitizer for Solid-State Photon Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon interconversion in semiconductors is of fundamental importance for digital imaging and quantum sensing. Nonlinear processes such as triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) offer photon upconversion (UC) at yields desired for solid-state optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a multilayer molecular system where a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer facilitates robust photon UC. A molecular stack of squaraine DIB-SQ: 6,6-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is optimized for UC by fine tuning the PCBM loading to engineer charge transfer states that facilitate further triplet generation. This composite NIR photosensitizer layer, at a 1:3 blend ratio in heterojunction with rubrene, drives triplet population density to levels desired for effective TTA. When paired with a fully optimized annihilator layer of tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) doped rubrene, the NIR sensitizer produces a photon upconversion quantum yield of 1.36% at 690 nm, with a significantly low excitation intensity threshold for the onset of the linear regime.. Time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption spectroscopy, and magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a detailed balance of photoexcited states and formation of charge transfer states of triplet character (3CT), which work in tandem with molecular states to sensitize the triplet state (T1) of rubrene. This approach of harnessing near-infrared photons presents promising avenue for advancing solid-state photon interconversion.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</description>

      <title>A general optimization framework for mapping local transition-state networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1 saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.</description>

      <title>TBPLaS 2.0: a Tight-Binding Package for Large-scale Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation based on the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM). This new version brings significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++ implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order. The workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and Chern number calculation, search of eigenvalues within a specific energy range, analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features. Benchmarks on modeling tools and solvers are also provided.</description>

      <title>Classical Heisenberg and XY models on zigzag ladder lattices with nearest-neighbor bilinear-biquadratic exchange: Exact solution for the ground-state problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact and complete solution of the ground-state problem for the classical Heisenberg and XY models with nearest-neighbor bilinear-biquadratic exchange on two- and three-dimensional lattices composed of isosceles triangles is determined with the use of a cluster method. It is shown how the geometric frustration due to the presence of triangles as structural units leads to the emergence of a rich phase diagram with incommensurate spiral orderings and their collinear limits, as well as canted and noncoplanar (conical) structures. Surprisingly, there are two different spiral phases with both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions between them. One of these phases is degenerate on two-dimensional partially anisotropic triangular lattice. This degeneracy is lifted on three-dimensional lattices. Canted phase is highly degenerate and this degeneracy persists on three-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing large-scale quantum computing requires superconducting circuits that combine long coherence times with compatibility with semiconductor technology. We investigate niobium nitride (NbN) coplanar waveguide resonators integrated with Si/SiGe quantum wells, creating a hybrid platform designed for CMOS-compatible quantum hardware. Using temperature-dependent microwave spectroscopy in the single-photon regime, we examine resonance frequency and quality factor variations to probe the underlying loss mechanisms. Our analysis identifies the roles of two-level systems, quasiparticles, and scattering processes, and connects these losses to wafer properties and fabrication methods. The devices demonstrate reproducible performance and stable operation maintained for over two years, highlighting their robustness. These results provide design guidelines for developing low-loss, CMOS-compatible superconducting circuits and support progress toward resilient, scalable architectures for quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases exist in theory, but real candidate QSL materials are often extraordinarily sensitive to structural defects which disrupt the ground state. Here, we investigate candidate triangular QSL material YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ and discover the absence of magnetic order, but also no compelling evidence of a QSL ground state due to significant structural disorder. We instead look at the results through a lens of a 2-dimensional (2D) random singlet phase. YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ behaves strikingly similar to other disordered triangular lattice materials, suggesting universal behavior of random singlet formation in 2D frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital altermagnetism on the kagome lattice and possible application to $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Amplified response of cavity-coupled quantum-critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state, and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological performance.</description>

      <title>High-Spin State Dynamics and Quintet-Mediated Emission in Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-spin states in molecular systems hold significant interest for a wide range of applications ranging from optoelectronics to quantum information and singlet fission (SF). Quintet and triplet states play crucial roles, particularly in SF systems, necessitating a precise monitoring and control of their spin dynamics. Spin states in intramolecular SF (iSF) are of particular interest, but tuning these systems to control triplet multiplication pathways has not been extensively studied. Additionally, whilst studies in this context focus on participation of triplet pathways leading to photoluminescence, emission pathways via quintet states remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ a set of unique spin-sensitive techniques to investigate high-spin state formation and emission in dimers and trimers comprising multiple diphenylhexatriene (DPH) units. We demonstrate the formation of pure quintet states in all these oligomers, with high-spin state optical emission via quintet states dominating delayed fluorescence up to room temperature. For triplet formation, we distinguish between the ability to form weakly exchange-coupled triplet pairs and the efficiency-reducing pathway of intersystem crossing (ISC), identifying the trimer Me-(DPH)$_3$ as the only oligomer exhibiting exclusively the desired SF pathways. Conversely, linear (DPH)$_3$ and (DPH)$_2$ show additional or exclusive triplet pathways via ISC. Our comprehensive analysis provides a detailed investigation into high-spin state formation, control, and emission in intramolecular singlet fission systems.</description>

      <title>Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e(\bf{r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}(\bf{r})$, since the two forms of the kinetic energy, $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$, lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise for interactions. This paper considers the ground state of a system of many interacting particles in an external potential, and presents a resolution in steps. 1) For the kinetic energy all effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions of position $\bf{r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n(\bf{r})$ and are equivalent to an effective single-particle problem with wavefunction $s(\bf{r}) = \sqrt{n(\bf{r})/N}$. 2) Interactions can be considered as potentials acting on particles or interaction fields, e.g., the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields. In each case, there is a mean field part that is a function of the density and a part due to correlation that is uniquely defined. 3) The final results follow from the nature of energy and stress. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the kinetic energy must involve $-\frac{1}{2}s\nabla^2 s$ and interactions in terms of potentials. This leads to density functional theory interpreted as energy density $e(\bf{r})$ equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential at all points $\bf{r}$. However, stress is related to forces, and the only acceptable expressions for the stress field involve the combination $\frac{1}{2}[s\nabla^2 s - |\nabla s|^2]$, and Coulomb interactions in terms of electric fields. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.</description>

      <title>How to choose efficiently the size of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation Hamiltonian for accurate exciton calculations on supercells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is the workhorse method to study excitons in materials. The BSE Hamiltonian size, which depends on how many valence-to-conduction band transitions are considered, needs to be chosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and wavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE calculations are expensive and scale with the number of atoms as $\mathcal{O}(N_{\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In particular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of $N_{\rm{rep}}$ replicas of a primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build this BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions derived from PC calculations by zone folding. However, this leads to a very large BSE Hamiltonian, as the number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence) states used. When creating a SC, the number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}$ but both the number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor, therefore the number of matrix elements in the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}^2$, making exactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here, we provide a workflow to decide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results, based on only PC results. With our method, we show that to converge the first exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, to an energy tolerance of 0.15 eV, we only need 12\% of the valence-to-conduction matrix elements that result from zone folding with a minimal set of bands. As an example, we use the number of bands from our method to obtain the absorption spectrum of LiF with a V$_k$-like defect. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic properties in large SC calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal aluminum nitrides are a technologically important class of multifunctional ceramics, however, the HfAlN system remains largely unexplored. We investigate phase stability, nanostructure design, and mechanical behavior of Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ thin films deposited on MgO(001) substrates using ion-assisted reactive magnetron sputtering. Compared to growth temperature and ion assistance, backscattered Ar neutrals are shown to have a dominant influence on the film structure. The Al-rich (x &gt; 0.41) films form a nanocrystalline morphology consisting of Hf- and Al-rich nanodomains in a wurtzite-hexagonal(h) 0001 fiber-texture exhibiting about 22 GPa hardness, considerably higher than that of a binary AlN. For low Al contents, x &lt; 0.30, surface-driven spinodal decomposition by energetic Ar neutrals during deposition in combination with quenching of sub-surface diffusion results in an unusual - and unique for nitrides - three-dimensional checkerboard superstructure of AlN- and HfN-rich nanodomains in the single-crystal rocksalt-cubic (c) phase. Lattice-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy complemented with x-ray and electron diffraction reveals that the superstructure periodicity extends along &lt;100&gt; directions and the size increases linearly from 9 to 13 A with rising Al content. Consequently, the nanoindentation hardness increases sharply from 26 GPa for HfN$_y$, to \~38 GPa for c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$, due to dislocation pinning at the superstructure strain fields. Micropillar compression of c-Hf$_{0.93}$Al$_{0.07}$N$_{1.15}$ shows a considerably higher yield stress compared to HfN$_y$ and controlled brittle fracture occurs via {110}&lt;011&gt; slip systems, attributed to superstructure inhibited dislocation motion. In contrast, nanocrystalline h-Hf$_{0.59}$Al$_{0.41}$N$_{1.23}$ exhibits a high yield stress and limited plasticity before strain burst failure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body Green's function calculations. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric effects. We observe local variations in exciton energy that correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization of the 3R-MoS$_2$ layer, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton transition energies. Gate voltage experiments demonstrate that the interlayer exciton energy can be tuned by electrically induced domain switching. These results highlight the potential for interlayer exciton control by local ferroelectric order and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence Paradox on Low-Symmetry Surfaces of Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals provide access to boundary phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Inspired by experimental observations on the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, which reveal an apparent mismatch between the surface Brillouin zone and bulk-projected Weyl points, we establish a least common multiple criterion for surface commensuration. We show that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate laterally shifted replicas that only close after three unit cells, giving rise to a momentum-space moire modulation and thereby resolving the apparent breakdown of bulk-boundary correspondence. Density functional theory slab calculations based on this three-cell supercell, together with Green's function methods that naturally incorporate multiple bulk zones, quantitatively reproduce the experiment. Beyond NdAlSi, the least common multiple framework provides a universal prescription for reconciling bulk and surface states on arbitrary facets, suggesting that overlapping Fermi arcs may hybridize into closed loops and enabling unconventional transport and interference phenomena unique to low-symmetry surfaces, accompanied by emergent moire patterns in momentum space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The L1_2-phase non-collinear antiferromagnet (AFM) Mn_3Ir has emerged as a pioneering platform for realizing the zero-field anomalous Hall effect (AHE), thereby catalyzing rapid advances in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Despite its significant potential, experimental investigations of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of Mn_3Ir have been greatly hindered by the formidable challenges in growing bulk single crystals. Here, we report the growth of stoichiometric Mn_3Ir bulk single crystals and their characterization in terms of magnetization and the AHE. Using a high-throughput flux method, we obtained (111)-oriented hexagonal Mn_3Ir single crystals. A small AHE signal was detected, which we attribute to the coexistence of A- and B-type antiferromagnetic domains that mutually cancel the net AHE response. Our results reveal key aspects of the intrinsic magnetic properties and AHE in bulk Mn_3Ir, providing a critical material platform for the development of advanced spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Domain Boundaries in a Metallic Distortive Polar Metal</title>

Abstract: Polar metals are an underexplored material class combining two properties that are typically incompatible, namely a polar crystal structure and reasonable electrical conductivity. While intriguing given that metals favor centrosymmetry, these materials also exhibit potential functional properties relevant to memory, optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications. The distortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a centrosymmetry-lifting phase transformation into a polar crystal structure. In the process, domains with uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain boundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in "charged" head-to-head (H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM microstructures have been studied. Here we reveal in the intermetallic DPM Mn5Al8 different chemical reactivity and surface interactions at domain boundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character. Variable surface electron-transfer reactivity suggests localized changes in electronic work functions due to an increase (H-H) or depletion (T-T) in the electronic density of states. This behavior is unintuitive in a metal where electrostatic de-polarizing fields should not account for fluctuations in carrier densities. These findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain boundary behavior and deserve increased attention. Metallic DPMs allow highly tunable chemistries that can undergo various thermomechanical processing and transformation protocols. Ultimately, this study marks a milestone in metal physics and uncovers novel intermetallic properties, propelling the discovery and design of advanced electronic materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Origin and stability of generalized Wigner crystallinity in triangular moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Wigner crystals (GWC) on triangular moir\'e superlattices, formed from stacking two layers of transition metal chalcogenides, have been observed at multiple fractional fillings [Nature 587, 214 - 218 (2020), Nat. Phys. 17, 715 - 719 (2021), Nature 597, 650 - 654 (2021)]. Motivated by these experiments, tied with the need for accurate microscopic descriptions of these materials, we explore the origins of GWC at $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ filling. We demonstrate the general limitations of theoretical descriptions relying on finite-range, versus long-range interactions, however, we clarify why some properties are captured by an effective nearest-neighbor model. We study both classical and quantum effects at zero and finite temperatures, discussing the role of charge frustration, identifying a ``pinball" phase, a partially quantum melted GWC, with no classical analog. Our work addresses several experimental observations and makes predictions for how many of the theoretical findings can be potentially realized in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e excitons and exciton-polaritons: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moir\'e excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moir\'e excitons hybridize with photons to form moir\'e exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features.
  In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moir\'e excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moir\'e patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir\'e polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moir\'e excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</description>

      <title>Multiple Topological Phases Controlled via Strain in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are an emergent class of magnetic materials that combine properties of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, exhibiting spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and zero net magnetic moment due to combined time-reversal and crystal symmetry. Here, we construct a Kondo-lattice model on a two-dimensional square Lieb lattice to investigate the topological properties of AMs. We identify a type-II quantum spin Hall state characterized by spin-polarized counterpropagating edge states. Breaking the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, which connects magnetic sublattices, induces a transition to a quantum anomalous Hall state. We further establish a strain-induced mechanism to control these topological phase transitions and present the corresponding phase diagram. Finally, we demonstrate the predicted transitions in monolayer CrO, a realistic altermagnetic candidate, using first-principles calculations. Our findings highlight the potential of 2D AMs as a versatile platform for topological spintronics, enabling strain-tunable helical and chiral edge states within a single system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Simulations of Catalytic Metal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of metal surfaces are critical for catalytic innovation. Yet existing methods face a cost-accuracy dilemma: density functional theory is efficient but system-dependent in accuracy, while wavefunction-based theories are accurate but prohibitively costly. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a systematically improvable quantum embedding framework that resolves this challenge by capturing partially filled electronic states in metals. FEMION combines auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo for local catalytic sites with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, yielding a scalable approach across diverse catalytic systems. Employing FEMION, we address two longstanding challenges: determining the preferred CO adsorption site and quantifying the H2 desorption barrier on Cu(111). Furthermore, our calculations demonstrate that the recently discovered 10-electron-count rule can also be extended to the single-atom catalysis processes on 3d metal surfaces, resolving the controversies arising from density functional theory calculations. We thus open a predictive, first-principles route to modeling complex catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic contribution of itinerant electrons to neutron diffraction in the topological antiferromagnet CeAlGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a neutron diffraction study of the magnetic structure of CeAlGe, a candidate topological semimetal that hosts a non-collinear, multi-$\mathbf{k}$ magnetic phase. By measuring both low- and high-momentum-transfer magnetic Bragg peaks within a single experimental setup, we refine a magnetic structure model based solely on localized Ce moments. This model, which differs from that obtained using only high-$Q$ data, quantitatively reproduces the observed intensities, including the $(000)$ zeroth-order magnetic satellites that are especially sensitive to subtle components of the modulation. While a contribution from itinerant electrons to the zeroth satellite cannot be definitively excluded, our analysis reveals no unambiguous evidence for such effects within experimental uncertainty. The refined magnetic structures exhibit topologically nontrivial winding patterns, derived from the fitted magnetic parameters, that support localized, particle-like spin textures with half-integer topological charges. These features provide a natural microscopic origin for the observed topological Hall effect, establishing CeAlGe as a model system where magnetism and topology are intimately linked.</description>

      <title>Reaction/Diffusion Competition Drives Anomalous Relaxation of Vitrimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vitrimers are an emerging class of crosslinked polymer networks in which dynamic covalent bonds can exchange and rearrange, without any significant change in population of bonded states.1 Because these bonds can rearrange at high temperatures without disintegration of the network, vitrimers could combine the mechanical stability of traditional permanently crosslinked networks with the recyclability of glasses and physical networks. However, unlike classical transient/physical networks, vitrimers can relax at a rate that is decoupled from the mobility of their polymer segments. This challenges our fundamental understanding of how dynamic covalent networks relax and deform. Here we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to show that vitrimer dynamics exhibit two very different regimes: (i) a high temperature regime controlled by the local bond-exchange reaction rate and (ii) a low temperature regime controlled by segmental diffusion. This fundamental difference from traditional physical networks explains why vitrimers can exhibit Arrhenius dynamics, providing a foundation for their rational design.</description>

      <title>Splitting of electronic spectrum in paramagnetic phase of itinerant ferromagnets and altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study self-energy effects, induced by strong magnetic fluctuations in paramagnetic phase of strongly-correlated itinerant magnets within the density functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT approach) and its non-local extension. As concrete examples, we consider $\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical approach based on the sinc basis set for first-principles electronic structure calculations in one-dimensional systems. The method exploits the inherent accuracy and non-local character of the sinc functions to handle long-range couplings effectively. As a proof of principle, we provide a computational study of a molecule in an optical cavity, with our code directly calculating the emergence of the energy level splitting in the spectrum.</description>
