      <title>A Concrete Variant of the Twistor Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove a concrete variant of the twistor theorem of Hitchin--Karlhede--Lindstr\"om--Ro\v{c}ek which applies when one already has the real manifold on which one wishes to construct a hyper-K\"ahler structure, and so one does not need to construct it as a parameter space of twistor lines.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of sub-Laplacian on Polarized groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize smooth maps between sub-Riemannian Lie groups that commute with sub-Laplacians.
  We show they are sub-Riemannian conformal submersions.
  Our work clarifies the analysis initiated on Carnot groups in \cite{MR2363343}.
  In particular, we show that the sub-Laplacian in a Carnot group determines the sub-Riemannian structure.</description>

      <title>On weakly Einstein K\"ahler surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riemannian four-manifolds in which the triple contraction of the curvature tensor against itself yields a functional multiple of the metric are called weakly Einstein. We focus on weakly Einstein K\"ahler surfaces. We provide several conditions characterizing those K\"ahler surfaces which are weakly Einstein, classify weakly Einstein K\"ahler surfaces having some specific additional properties, and construct new examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper highlights similarities between an even dimensional geometry (symplectic) and an odd dimensional geometry (cosymplectic). We study the Lagrangian Grassmannian in the cosymplectic setting. The space of compatible co-complex structures is introduced and studied. A study of Moser's trick and Lagrangian neighborhood theorems in the cosymplectic context follow. The corresponding Weinstein $1-$form is derived, and its de Rham class is a co-flux.</description>

      <title>On solvmanifolds with complex commutator and constant holomorphic sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An old open question in non-K\"ahler geometry predicts that any compact Hermitian manifold with constant holomorphic sectional curvature must be K\"ahler or Chern flat. The conjecture is known to be true in dimension $2$ due to the work by Balas-Gauduchon and Apostolov-Davidov-Muskarov in the 1980s and 1990s, but is still open in dimensions $3$ or higher, except in several special cases. The difficulty in this quest for `Hermitian space forms' is largely due to the algebraic complicity or lack of symmetry for the curvature tensor of a general Hermitian metric. In this article, we confirm the conjecture for all solvmanifolds with complex commutator, extending earlier result on nilmanifolds by Li and the second named author.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Tiling Theorem for Fractal Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper present a meticulous measure-theoretic proof of the Chromatic Tiling Theorem for regular tilings of compact, self-similar fractal domains satisfying the Open Set Condition. We rigorously establish a sharp upper bound for the chromatic number of such tilings, predicated on the fractal's intrinsic Hausdorff dimension $d$, its boundary Hausdorff dimension $b$, and the regularity parameters of the tiling. Specifically, we demonstrate that if $d &gt; b$, the chromatic number $\chi(\mathcal{T})$ of a regular tiling $\mathcal{T}$ admits the bound \[ \chi(\mathcal{T}) \leq C \left( 1 + \left(\frac{r_{\max}}{r_{\min}}\right)^{\max(0, b - (d - 1))} \right), \] where $C$ is a strictly positive constant contingent solely upon the dimension of the embedding Euclidean space, $n$, and intrinsic measure-theoretic properties of the fractal $F$. The proof meticulously leverages precise estimates on the $(d - 1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the intersections of tile relative boundaries, rigorously justified by the imposed regularity conditions of the tiling and foundational results from geometric measure theory, including the Besicovitch Covering Theorem and properties of Hausdorff measures on Ahlfors regular sets. This approach provides a direct and intrinsic link between the fractal's dimensional characteristics and the combinatorial complexity of its tilings, offering a nuanced perspective that transcends considerations solely within the ambient Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Positive Scalar Curvature and Exotic Structures on Simply Connected Four Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address Gromov's band width inequality and Rosenberg's $S^1$-stability conjecture for simply connected smooth four-manifolds. Both results are known to be false in dimension 4 due to counterexamples based on Seiberg-Witten invariants. Nevertheless, we show that both of these results hold upon considering smooth four-manifolds up to homeomorphism. The key technical innovation is a careful adaptation of ideas from high-dimensional surgery theory to dimension 4.</description>

      <title>Gap phenomenon for scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Goette-Semmelmann \cite{GSSU2002}, we derive an estimate for the scalar curvature without a nonnegativity assumption on curvature operator. As an application, we show that, on an even dimensional closed manifold with nonzero Euler characteristic, any Riemannian metric $g$ is $\epsilon$-gap distance extremal for some $\epsilon \geq 0$. For manifolds with boundary, inspired by Lott \cite{JL2021}, we obtained a similar estimate for scalar curvature and mean curvature. We apply the estimate on certain Euclidean domains to study a Gromov's question in \cite{GM20233} concerning the extension problem of metric on the boundary to the interior.</description>

      <title>Overview of the proof of the exterior stability of the $(1+3)$-Minkowski space-time governed by the Einstein-Yang-Mills system in the Lorenz gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Einstein-Yang-Mills system in both the Lorenz and harmonic gauges, where the Yang-Mills fields are valued in any arbitrary Lie algebra $\cal G$, associated to any compact Lie group $G$. This gives a system of hyperbolic partial partial differential that does not satisfy the null condition and that has new complications that are not present for the Einstein vacuum equations nor for the Einstein-Maxwell system. We prove the exterior stability of the Minkowski space-time, $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, governed by the fully coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills system in the Lorenz gauge, valued in any arbitrary Lie algebra $\cal G$, without any assumption of spherical symmetry. We start with an arbitrary sufficiently small initial data, defined in a suitable energy norm for the perturbations of the Yang-Mills potential and of the Minkowski space-time, and we show the well-posedness of the Cauchy development in the exterior, and we prove that this leads to solutions converging in the Lorenz gauge and in wave coordinates to the zero Yang-Mills fields and to the Minkowski space-time. This provides a first detailed proof of the exterior stability of Minkowski governed by the fully non-linear Einstein-Yang-Mills equations in the Lorenz gauge, by using a null frame decomposition that was first used by H. Lindblad and I. Rodnianski for the case of the Einstein vacuum equations. We note that in contrast to the much simpler case of the Einstein-Maxwell equations where one can omit the potential, in fact in the non-abelian case of the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations, the question of stability, or non-stability, is a purely gauge dependent statement and the partial differential equations depend on the gauge on the Yang-Mills potential that is needed to write up the equations.</description>

      <title>Relative Pose Observability Analysis Using Dual Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative pose (position and orientation) estimation is an essential component of many robotics applications. Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Minkowski problem associated with the solution to the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian (or Finsler $p$-Laplacian) equation, namely, the Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a solution to the anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity Minkowski problem are presented. Meanwhile, the existence of a solution to the log-Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity without symmetry assumptions is solved.</description>

      <title>Trading linearity for ellipticity: a nonsmooth approach to Einstein's theory of gravity and the Lorentzian splitting theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Einstein's theory of gravity is formulated in a smooth setting, the celebrated singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose describe many physical situations in which this smoothness must eventually break down. In positive-definite signature, there is a highly successful theory of metric and metric-measure geometry which includes Riemannian manifolds as a special case, but permits the extraction of nonsmooth limits under dimension and curvature bounds analogous to the energy conditions from relativity: here sectional curvature is reformulated through triangle comparison, while Ricci curvature is reformulated using entropic convexity along geodesics of probability measures.
  This lecture highlights recent progress in the development of an analogous theory in Lorentzian signature, whose ultimate goal is to provide a nonsmooth theory of gravity. In particular, we foreshadow a low-regularity splitting theorem obtained by sacrificing linearity of the d'Alembertian to recover ellipticity. We exploit a negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator for this purpose. The same technique yields a simplified proof of Eschenberg (1988), Galloway (1989), and Newman's (1990) confirmation of Yau's (1982) conjecture, bringing both Lorentzian splitting results into a framework closer to the Cheeger--Gromoll (1971) splitting theorem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Socio-Economic Challenges and Technological Progress on Economic Inequality: An Estimation with the Perelman Model and Ricci Flow Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article examines the impact of 16 key parameters of the Georgian economy on economic inequality, using the Perelman model and Ricci flow mathematical methods. The study aims to conduct a deep analysis of the impact of socio-economic challenges and technological progress on the dynamics of the Gini coefficient. The article examines the following parameters: income distribution, productivity (GDP per hour), unemployment rate, investment rate, inflation rate, migration (net negative), education level, social mobility, trade infrastructure, capital flows, innovative activities, access to healthcare, fiscal policy (budget deficit), international trade (turnover relative to GDP), social protection programs, and technological access. The results of the study confirm that technological innovations and social protection programs have a positive impact on reducing inequality. Productivity growth, improving the quality of education, and strengthening R&amp;D investments increase the possibility of inclusive development. Sensitivity analysis shows that social mobility and infrastructure are important factors that affect economic stability. The accuracy of the model is confirmed by high R^2 values (80-90%) and the statistical reliability of the Z-statistic (&lt;0.05). The study uses Ricci flow methods, which allow for a geometric analysis of the transformation of economic parameters in time and space. Recommendations include the strategic introduction of technological progress, the expansion of social protection programs, improving the quality of education, and encouraging international trade, which will contribute to economic sustainability and reduce inequality. The article highlights multifaceted approaches that combine technological innovation and responses to socio-economic challenges to ensure sustainable and inclusive economic development.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of HCMU surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HCMU surfaces are compact Riemann surfaces equipped with an extremal K\"{a}hler metric and a finite number of singularities. Research on these surfaces was initiated by E. Calabi and X.-X. Chen over thirty years ago. We provide a detailed description of the geometric structure of HCMU surfaces, building on the classical football decomposition introduced by Chen-Chen-Wu. From this perspective, most HCMU surfaces can be uniquely described by a set of data that includes both discrete topological information and continuous geometric parameters. This data representation is effective for studying the moduli space of HCMU surfaces with specified genus and conical angles, suggesting a topological approach to this topic. As a first application, we present a unified proof of the angle constraints on HCMU surfaces. Using the same approach, we establish an existence theorem for HCMU surfaces of any genus with a single conical point, which is also a saddle point. Finally, we determine the dimension of the moduli space, defined as the number of independent continuous parameters. This is achieved by examining several geometric deformations of HCMU surfaces and the various relationships between the quantities in the data set representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Misner space, incorporating Kip Thorne's "moving wall" model, and pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, exploring their geometric structures, geodesics, and causal properties. We propose that pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime serves as a non-flat generalization of Misner space. We then introduce the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, a novel chronology-violating model that extends the previous two frameworks and unifies the geodesic structures of all three spacetimes. We suggest that these spacetimes constitute a causality-violating family, interconnected through common fundamental causal features$-$geodesics, Cauchy and chronology horizons, and acausal regions$-$leading a conjecture that they are isocausal.</description>

Abstract: We consider the cone of concentration matrices related to linear concentration models and Wishart laws. We prove that this cone is a Monge--Amp\`ere domain and that the log-likelihood function generates its potential function at the identity. The tangent sheaf carries the structure of a pre-Lie algebra. We also show that the moduli space of diagonal matrices parameterizing the polyhedral spectrahedron satisfies the Associativity Equations, a notion central in mirror symmetry, and that its compactification is a toric variety associated to a permutohedron, reminiscent to Losev--Manin spaces. Finally we introduce Frobenius residuals: these are connected components of the compactified Frobenius manifold of diagonal matrices, generated by the Bia\l{}ynicki--Birula cells. We prove that the Maximum Likelihood degree is indexed by components lying on those Frobenius residuals.</description>

      <title>Lie Transformation Groups -- An Introduction to Symmetry Group Analysis of Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:1506.07131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are lecture notes of a course on symmetry group analysis of differential equations, based mainly on P. J. Olver's book 'Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations'. The course starts out with an introduction to the theory of local transformation groups, based on the Stefan-Sussman theory on the integrability of distributions of non-constant rank. The exposition is self-contained, pre-supposing only basic knowledge in differential geometry and Lie groups.</description>

Abstract: We study the setting of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups in the particular case that its type (p,q) is not exceptional. We demonstrate that, generically, the orbits of $\mathbb R^{&gt;0}\times Aut_0$ in $GL(n)/O(n)$ are congruent even when a Ricci soliton metric does exists. In doing so, we provide a counterexample to the local version of a conjecture of Taketomi-Tamaru.</description>

      <title>On the rigidity of Ricci shrinkers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the rigidity of the generalized cylinder $N^n \times \mathbb R^{m-n}$, or a quotient thereof, in the space of Ricci shrinkers equipped with the pointed-Gromov-Hausdorff topology. Here, $N$ is a stable Einstein manifold that has an obstruction of order $3$. The proof is based on a quantitative characterization of the rigidity of compact Ricci shrinkers, a rigidity inequality of mixed orders on generalized cylinders, and the method of contraction and extension. As an application, we prove the uniqueness of the tangent flow for general compact Ricci flows under the assumption that one tangent flow is a generalized cylinder.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau structures on the complexifications of rank two symmeric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17418v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a (Reimannian) symmetric space $G/K$ of compact type, the natural action of $G$ on its complexification $G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$ (which is an anti-Kaehler symmetric space) is one of the isometric actions called ``Hermann type action''. Let $\psi$ be the $G$-invariant strictly plurisubharmonic $C^{\infty}$-function on an open set of $G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$ arising from a $W$-invariant strictly convex $C^{\infty}$-function $\rho$ on an open set of a maximal abelian subspace $\mathfrak a^d$ of $\mathfrak p^d$, where $\mathfrak p^d$ is the subspace of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g^d$ of $G^d$ such that $\mathfrak g^d=\mathfrak k\oplus\mathfrak p^d$ gives the Cartan decomposition associated to the dual symmetric space $G^d/K$ of $G/K$ and $W$ is the Weyl group assocaited to $\mathfrak a^d$. In this paper, we first give a new proof of a known relation between the complex Hessian of $\psi$ and the Hessian of $\rho$. This new proof is performed from the viewpoint of the orbit geometry of the Hermann type action $G\curvearrowright G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$. In more detail, it is performed by using the explicit descriptions of the shape operators of the orbits of the isotropy action $K\curvearrowright G^d/K$ and the Hermann type action $G\curvearrowright G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$. Next we prove that there exists a $C^{\infty}$-Calabi-Yau structure on the whole of the complexification $G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$ in the case where $G/K$ is of rank two on the basis of this relation. In the future, the above new proof will be useful to investigate the existence of invariant Calabi-Yau structure on an anti-Kaehler manifold equipped with a certain kind of complex hyperpolar action in more general, where we note that Hermann type actions are complex hyperpolar.</description>

      <title>A sharp scalar curvature inequality for submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M^n, n\geq 3,$ be a complete Riemannian manifold of constant scalar curvature $R$ and $f: M^n\rightarrow M^{n+k}(c)$ be an isometric immersion into a space form with flat normal bundle. Assume that $f$ admits a principal normal vector field which has multiplicity $n-1$ at each point of $M^n.$ Our first result is global and states that (i) $R\geq 0$ if $c=0;$\ (ii) $ R&gt; (n-1)(n-2)c$ if $c&gt; 0;$ and (iii) $R\geq n(n-1)c$ if $c&lt; 0.$ These inequalities are optimal. Our second result states that if we further assume that the mean curvature field of $f$ is parallel, then the sectional curvature of $M^n$ is bounded below by $c.$ As a consequence, we classify submanifolds which satisfy the latter condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Yau-Tian-Donaldson type correspondence for $v$-solitons established by Han-Li, we show that a smooth complex $n$-dimensional Fano variety admits a Mabuchi soliton provided it admits an extremal K\"ahler metric whose scalar curvature is strictly less than $2(n+1)$. Combined with previous observations by Mabuchi and Nakamura in the other direction, this gives a characterization of the existence of Mabuchi solitons in terms of the existence of extremal K\"ahler metrics on Fano manifolds. An extension of this correspondence to $v$-solitons is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Volume renormalization of higher-codimension singular Yamabe spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an embedded closed submanifold $\Sigma^n$ in the closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n + k}$, where $k &lt; n + 2$, we define extrinsic global conformal invariants of $\Sigma$ by renormalizing the volume associated to the unique singular Yamabe metric with singular set $\Sigma$. In case $n$ is odd, the renormalized volume is an absolute conformal invariant, while if $n$ is even, there is a conformally invariant energy term given by the integral of a local Riemannian submanifold invariant. In particular, the renormalized volume gives a global conformal invariant of a knot embedding in the three-sphere. We compute the variations of these quantities with respect to variations of the submanifold. We extend the construction of energies for even $n$ to general codimension by considering formal solutions to the singular Yamabe problem; except that, for each fixed $n$, there are finitely many $k \geq n + 2$, which we identify, for which the smoothness of the formal solution is obstructed and we obtain instead a pointwise conformal invariant. We compute the new quantities in several cases.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of K\"ahler--Frobenius manifolds and their classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to show that flat compact K\"ahler manifolds exhibit the structure of a Frobenius manifold, a structure originating in 2D Topological Quantum Field Theory and closely related to Joyce structure. As a result, we classify all such manifolds. It can be deduced that K\"ahler--Frobenius manifolds include certain Calabi--Yau manifolds, complex tori $T=\mathbb{C}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$, generalized (orientable) Hantzsche--Wendt manifolds, hyperelliptic manifolds and manifolds of type $T/G$, where $G$ is a finite group acting on $T$ freely and containing no translations. An explicit study is provided for the two-dimensional case. Additionally, we can prove that Chern's conjecture for K\"ahler pre-Frobenius manifolds holds. Lastly, we establish that certain classes of K\"ahler-Frobenius manifolds share a direct relationship with theta functions which are important objects in number theory as well as complex analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension $d$, and let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ have unit norm. We construct a lamination $\lambda_\rho$ whose leaves are exactly the minimal hypersurfaces which are calibrated by every calibration in $\rho$. The geometry of $\lambda_\rho$ is closely related to the the geometry of the unit ball of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$, and so we deduce several results constraining the geometry of the stable norm ball in terms of the topology of $M$. These results establish a close analogy between the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ and the earthquake norm on the tangent space to Teichm\"uller space.</description>

Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of four manifolds with macroscopic dimension 4 equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. Further, we verify that these bundles have macroscopic dimension at most 3. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>

Abstract: In the Minkowski space, we consider a spacelike hypersurface with boundary, which can be written as a graph. We prove that, if its $k$-th mean curvature is constant, and its boundary is on a hyperplane with constant intersection angles, then the hypersurface must be a part of the hyperboloid. This result can be seen as an analog of the sphere theorem for the hypersurface of constant $k$-th mean curvature in the Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Relative Equilibria for Scaling Symmetries and Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore scaling symmetries within the framework of symplectic geometry. We focus on the action $\Phi$ of the multiplicative group $G = \mathbb{R}^+$ on exact symplectic manifolds $(M, \omega,\theta)$, with $\omega = -d\theta$, where $ \theta $ is a given primitive one-form. Extending established results in symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian dynamics, we introduce conformally symplectic maps, conformally Hamiltonian systems, conformally symplectic group actions, and the notion of conformal invariance. This framework allows us to generalize the momentum map to the conformal momentum map, which is crucial for understanding scaling symmetries. Additionally, we provide a generalized Hamiltonian Noether's theorem for these symmetries.
  We introduce the (conformal) augmented Hamiltonian $H_{\xi}$ and prove that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to equations involving $ H _{ \xi } $ and the primitive one-form $\theta$. We derive their main properties, emphasizing the differences from relative equilibria in traditional symplectic actions.
  For cotangent bundles, we define a scaled cotangent lifted action and derive explicit formulas for the conformal momentum map. We also provide a general definition of central configurations for Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles that admit scaling symmetries. Applying these results to simple mechanical systems, we introduce the augmented potential $U_{\xi}$ and show that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to an equation involving $ U _{ \xi } $ and the Lagrangian one-form $\theta_L$.
  Finally, we apply our general theory to the Newtonian $n$-body problem, recovering the classical equations for central configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kontsevich suggested that the Landau-Ginzburg model presents a good formalism for homological mirror symmetry. In this paper we propose to investigate the LG theory from the viewpoint of Koopman-von Neumann's construction. New advances are thus provided, namely regarding a conjecture of Kontsevich-Soibelman (on a version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow mirror problem). We show that there exists a Monge-Amp\`ere domain Y, generated by a space of probability densities parametrising mirror dual Calabi-Yau manifolds. This provides torus fibrations over Y. The mirror pairs are obtained via the Berglund-Hubsch-Krawitz construction. We also show that the Monge-Amp\`ere manifolds are pre-Frobenius manifolds. Our method allows to recover certain results concerning Lagrangian torus fibrations. We illustrate our construction on a concrete toy model, which allows us, additionally to deduce a relation between von Neumann algebras, Monge-Amp\`ere manifolds and pre-Frobenius manifolds.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Willmore energy as holographic entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum entanglement entropy of a general conformal field theory (CFT) in $d=5$ spacetime dimensions contains a universal term, $F(A)$, which has a complicated and non-local dependence on the geometric details of the region $A$ and the theory. Analogously to the previously known $d=3$ case, we prove that for CFTs in $d=5$ which are holographically dual to Einstein gravity, $F(A)$ is equal to a four-dimensional version of the ``Willmore energy'' associated to a doubled and closed version of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface of $A$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^5$. This generalized Willmore energy is shown to arise from a conformal-invariant codimension-two functional obtained by evaluating six-dimensional Conformal Gravity on the conically-singular orbifold of the replica trick. The new functional involves an integral over the doubled RT surface of a linear combination of three quartic terms in extrinsic curvatures and is free from ultraviolet divergences by construction. We verify explicitly the validity of our new formula for various entangling regions and argue that, as opposed to the $d=3$ case, $F(A)$ is not globally minimized by a round ball $A=\mathbb{B}^4$. Rather, $F(A)$ can take arbitrarily positive and negative values as a function of $A$. Hence, we conclude that the round ball is not a global minimizer of $F(A)$ for general five-dimensional CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture, frequently reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) error between 15% to 35% on select datasets. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</description>

      <title>A family of instanton-invariants for four-manifolds and their relation to Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13285</link>

Abstract: This article reviews Witten's gauge-theoretic approach to Khovanov homology from the perspective of Haydys-Witten instanton Floer theory. Expanding on Witten's arguments, we introduce a one-parameter family of instanton Floer homology groups $HF_{\theta}(W^4)$, which, based on physical arguments, are expected to be topological invariants of the four-manifold $W^4$. In analogy to the original Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory, these groups are defined by the solutions of the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo instanton solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between them on the five-dimensional cylinder $\mathbb{R}_s \times W^4$. The relation to knot invariants arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blowup $W^4 = [X^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K]$ along a knot $K \subset X^3 \times \{0\}$ embedded in its three-dimensional boundary. The boundaries and corners of this manifold require the specification of boundary conditions that preserve the topological invariance of the construction and are fundamentally linked to various dimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. We provide a comprehensive discussion of these dimensional reductions and relate them to well-known gauge-theoretic equations in lower dimensions, including the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations, twisted extended Bogomolny equations, and twisted octonionic Nahm equations. Along the way, we record novel results on the elliptic regularity of the Haydys-Witten equations with twisted Nahm pole boundary conditions. The upshot of the article is a tentative definition of Haydys-Witten Floer theory and a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture: an equality between the Haydys-Witten Floer homology $HF^\bullet_{\pi/2}([S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\bullet(K)$.</description>
