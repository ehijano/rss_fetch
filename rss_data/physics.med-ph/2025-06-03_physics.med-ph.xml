      <title>Single-Shot, Single-Mask X-ray Dark-field and Phase Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray imaging, traditionally relying on attenuation contrast, struggles to differentiate materials with similar attenuation coefficients like soft tissues. X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI) and dark-field (DF) imaging provide enhanced contrast by detecting phase shifts and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS). However, they typically require complex and costly setups, along with multiple exposures to retrieve various contrast features. In this study, we introduce a novel single-mask X-ray imaging system design that simultaneously captures attenuation, differential phase contrast (DPC), and dark-field images in a single exposure. Most importantly, our proposed system design requires just a single mask alignment with relatively low-resolution detectors. Using our novel light transport models derived for these specific system designs, we show intuitive understanding of contrast formation and retrieval method of different contrast features. Our approach eliminates the need for highly coherent X-ray sources, ultra-high-resolution detectors, spectral detectors or intricate gratings. We propose three variations of the single-mask setup, each optimized for different contrast types, offering flexibility and efficiency in a variety of applications. The versatility of this single-mask approach along with the use of befitting light transport models holds promise for broader use in clinical diagnostics and industrial inspection, making advanced X-ray imaging more accessible and cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Scheduled Score-Based Generative Modeling for Fully 3D PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image reconstruction with pre-trained score-based generative models (SGMs) has advantages over other existing state-of-the-art deep-learned reconstruction methods, including improved resilience to different scanner setups and advanced image distribution modeling. SGM-based reconstruction has recently been applied to simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets, showing improved contrast recovery for out-of-distribution lesions relative to the state-of-the-art. However, existing methods for SGM-based reconstruction from PET data suffer from slow reconstruction, burdensome hyperparameter tuning and slice inconsistency effects (in 3D). In this work, we propose a practical methodology for fully 3D reconstruction that accelerates reconstruction and reduces the number of critical hyperparameters by matching the likelihood of an SGM's reverse diffusion process to a current iterate of the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm. Using the example of low-count reconstruction from simulated [$^{18}$F]DPA-714 datasets, we show our methodology can match or improve on the NRMSE and SSIM of existing state-of-the-art SGM-based PET reconstruction while reducing reconstruction time and the need for hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate our methodology against state-of-the-art supervised and conventional reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate a first-ever implementation of SGM-based reconstruction for real 3D PET data, specifically [$^{18}$F]DPA-714 data, where we integrate perpendicular pre-trained SGMs to eliminate slice inconsistency issues.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation and Dosimetric Analysis of Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) in Breast Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise radiation delivery is critical for effective radiotherapy, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as promising tools to enhance local dose deposition while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. In this study, the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code was used to investigate the dosimetry of AuNPs under different conditions and models. The Dose Enhancement Ratio (DER) was studied in water and breast tissue with spherical shapes and in agreement with previously published results. To further analyse the physical interactions of the particles around the AuNP, a Phase Space File (PSF) in a volume around the AuNPs was created. This showed that larger AuNPs lead to increased doses, as expected, yielding DER values exceeding 100 times. Finally, results reveal that in the volume surrounding the AuNP, 80% of emitted electrons originate from photoelectric absorption, leading to Auger electron emission cascades which were analysed in detail. It was also possible to establish a direct relation between number of secondaries and the particle volumes. The Local Effect Model (LEM) was used to determine survival curves in AuNPs of different sizes at different gold concentrations. The last part of this work consisted in analysing a distribution of AuNPs within a flattened cell typical of clonogenic assays where a log-normal distribution of dose was observed. This led to the development of a new, mechanistic, Local Effect Model which, if further validated, can have further applications in-vitro and in-silico.</description>
