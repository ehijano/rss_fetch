      <title>Learning High-dimensional Latent Variable Models via Doubly Stochastic Optimisation by Unadjusted Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent variable models are widely used in social and behavioural sciences, such as education, psychology, and political science. In recent years, high-dimensional latent variable models have become increasingly common for analysing large and complex data. Estimating high-dimensional latent variable models using marginal maximum likelihood is computationally demanding due to the complexity of integrals involved. To address this challenge, stochastic optimisation, which combines stochastic approximation and sampling techniques, has been shown to be effective. This method iterates between two steps -- (1) sampling the latent variables from their posterior distribution based on the current parameter estimate, and (2) updating the fixed parameters using an approximate stochastic gradient constructed from the latent variable samples. In this paper, we propose a computationally more efficient stochastic optimisation algorithm. This improvement is achieved through the use of a minibatch of observations when sampling latent variables and constructing stochastic gradients, and an unadjusted Langevin sampler that utilises the gradient of the negative complete-data log-likelihood to sample latent variables. Theoretical results are established for the proposed algorithm, showing that the iterative parameter update converges to the marginal maximum likelihood estimate as the number of iterations goes to infinity. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is shown to scale well to high-dimensional settings through simulation studies and a personality test application with 30,000 respondents, 300 items, and 30 latent dimensions.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to informed MCMC sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09010</link>

Abstract: A Riemannian geometric framework for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is developed where using the Fisher-Rao metric on the manifold of probability density functions (pdfs) informed proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms are constructed. We exploit the square-root representation of pdfs under which the Fisher-Rao metric boils down to the standard $L^2$ metric on the positive orthant of the unit hypersphere. The square-root representation allows us to easily compute the geodesic distance between densities, resulting in a straightforward implementation of the proposed geometric MCMC methodology. Unlike the random walk MH that blindly proposes a candidate state using no information about the target, the geometric MH algorithms effectively move an uninformed base density (e.g., a random walk proposal density) towards different global/local approximations of the target density. We compare the proposed geometric MH algorithm with other MCMC algorithms for various Markov chain orderings, namely the covariance, efficiency, Peskun, and spectral gap orderings. The superior performance of the geometric algorithms over other MH algorithms like the random walk Metropolis, independent MH and variants of Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms is demonstrated in the context of various multimodal, nonlinear and high dimensional examples. In particular, we use extensive simulation and real data applications to compare these algorithms for analyzing mixture models, logistic regression models and ultra-high dimensional Bayesian variable selection models. A publicly available R package accompanies the article.</description>

      <title>When Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived - somewhat naively - as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands.
  Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics - that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases - with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests.
  Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by a class of weighted linear statistics.</description>

      <title>Oblivious subspace embeddings for compressed Tucker decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emphasis in the tensor literature on random embeddings (tools for low-distortion dimension reduction) for the canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition has left analogous results for the more expressive Tucker decomposition comparatively lacking. This work establishes general Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) type guarantees for the estimation of Tucker decompositions when an oblivious random embedding is applied along each mode. When these embeddings are drawn from a JL-optimal family, the decomposition can be estimated within $\varepsilon$ relative error under restrictions on the embedding dimension that are in line with recent CP results. We implement a higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) decomposition algorithm with random embeddings to demonstrate the practical benefits of this approach and its potential to improve the accessibility of otherwise prohibitive tensor analyses. On moderately large face image and fMRI neuroimaging datasets, empirical results show that substantial dimension reduction is possible with minimal increase in reconstruction error relative to traditional HOOI ($\leq$5% larger error, 50%-60% lower computation time for large models with 50% dimension reduction along each mode). Especially for large tensors, our method outperforms traditional higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and recently proposed TensorSketch methods.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: I. Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the most fundamental problem in statistics, robust location estimation has many prominent solutions, such as the trimmed mean, Winsorized mean, Hodges Lehmann estimator, Huber M estimator, and median of means. Recent studies suggest that their maximum biases concerning the mean can be quite different, but the underlying mechanisms largely remain unclear. This study exploited a semiparametric method to classify distributions by the asymptotic orderliness of quantile combinations with varying breakdown points, showing their interrelations and connections to parametric distributions. Further deductions explain why the Winsorized mean typically has smaller biases compared to the trimmed mean; two sequences of semiparametric robust mean estimators emerge, particularly highlighting the superiority of the median Hodges Lehmann mean. This article sheds light on the understanding of the common nature of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: V. Non-asymptotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the complexity of order statistics, the finite sample behaviour of robust statistics is generally not analytically solvable. While the Monte Carlo method can provide approximate solutions, its convergence rate is typically very slow, making the computational cost to achieve the desired accuracy unaffordable for ordinary users. In this paper, we propose an approach analogous to the Fourier transformation to decompose the finite sample structure of the uniform distribution. By obtaining sets of sequences that are consistent with parametric distributions for the first four sample moments, we can approximate the finite sample behavior of other estimators with significantly reduced computational costs. This article reveals the underlying structure of randomness and presents a novel approach to integrate multiple assumptions.</description>
