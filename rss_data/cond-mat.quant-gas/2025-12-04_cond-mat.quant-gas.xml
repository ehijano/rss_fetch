      <title>Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold fermions in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold neutral atoms in optical lattices are a promising platform for simulating the behavior of complex materials and implementing quantum gates. We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant. We obtain high-fidelity gates based on a one-dimensional confinement simulation. Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately.</description>

      <title>Progress in quantum metrology and applications for optical atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement offers powerful opportunities for enhancing measurement sensitivity beyond classical limits, with optical atomic clocks serving as a leading platform for such advances. This chapter introduces the principles of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology and explores their applications to timekeeping. We review the theoretical framework of quantum phase estimation, comparing frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and discuss paradigmatic entangled states such as spin-squeezed and GHZ states. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges posed by decoherence, which constrain the practical advantages that can be realized in large-scale devices. The discussion then turns to frequency estimation in atomic clocks, highlighting how experimental constraints shape the translation of abstract quantum limits into real performance gains. Finally, we outline emerging directions of contemporary quantum metrology. Together, these developments underscore the increasingly close interplay between quantum information processing and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>More is uncorrelated: Tuning the local correlations of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems via controlled symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.
  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.
  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Ballistic particle transport and Drude weight in gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to the fact that the particle current operator in non-relativistic gases is proportional to the total momentum operator, the particle transport in such systems is always ballistic and fully characterized by a Drude weight $\Delta$. The Drude weight can be calculated within linear response theory. It is given by the formula $\Delta = 2 \pi D$, where $D$ is the density of the gas. This holds in any dimension and for every equilibrium ensemble, in particular for generalized Gibbs ensembles that describe possible equilibrium states of isolated integrable quantum systems. In the canonical ensemble case, the Drude weight can be equivalently obtained from a generalized susceptibility related to the fluctuations of the conserved particle current. Such susceptibility can be rigorously calculated for the integrable Lieb-Liniger Bose gas in any generalized Gibbs ensemble using a generalized Yang-Yang thermodynamic formalism. The resulting expression agrees with a prediction made within the context of generalized hydrodynamics. It also allows us to see explicitly that, within truly generalized Gibbs ensembles, the conductivity related with the particle current is not determined by the corresponding current-current auto-correlation function.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $T$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $T$ and some other symmetry operation $O$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $O$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Observation of a supersolid phase in a spin-orbit coupled exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), spin-orbit coupling (SOC) produces supersolidity. It is a peculiar state of matter, which, in addition to the superfluid behaviour shows periodic density modulation typical for crystals. Here, we report the fabrication of a new type of optical microcavity allowing to achieve room-temperature supersolidity for a quantum fluid of light. The microcavity is filled with a nematic liquid crystal (LC) and two layers of the organic polymer MeLPPP hosting exciton resonances. We demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in the two distinct degenerate minima of the dispersion created by the LC induced Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) SOC. The condensate real-space distribution shows density stripes located randomly from one condensate realization to another despite the presence of a random disorder potential. This demonstrates the immunity of stripes against disorder (that is, superfluidity) and the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance. We also report the random appearance of vortices via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, another smoking gun of superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Resonant dynamics of spin cluster in a periodically driven one-dimensional Rydberg lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic constraints, leading to ballistic and nonergodic behavior at different detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation.</description>
