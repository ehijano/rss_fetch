      <title>Embedding Signature-Changing Manifolds: A Braneworld and Kaluza-Klein Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08662v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of semi-Riemannian manifolds characterized by smooth metric signature changes with a transverse radical, This class includes spacetimes relevant to cosmological models such as the Hartle-Hawking "no boundary" proposal, where a Riemannian manifold transitions smoothly into a Lorentzian spacetime without boundaries or singularities. For this class, we prove the existence of global isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces. We then strengthen this result by demonstrating that a specific type of global isometric embedding, which we term an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding, also exists into both Minkowski space and Misner space. For the canonical $n$-dimensional signature-changing model, we explicitly construct a full global isometric embedding into $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski and Misner spaces, a significantly stronger result than an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding for this specific case. This embedding framework provides new geometric tools for studying signature change and braneworlds through the geometry of submanifolds embedded in a bulk, thus presenting a mathematically well-defined approach to these phenomena.</description>

      <title>The volume comparison of symmetric spaces of non-compact type of rank 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Schoen's conjecture on the volume functional for closed hyperbolic manifolds, we generalize the volume comparison theorem of Hu-Ji-Shi and establish an volume comparison result for symmetric spaces of non-compact type of rank 1 under a scalar curvature condition. Furthermore, we establish a rigidity result. Our proof utilizes the normalized Ricci-DeTurck flow to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the volume functional and derive monotonicity properties. This result extends the classical volume comparison framework to non-compact symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>A Non-Trivial $(\mathbf{R},+)$ Principal Bundle over a Contractible Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit example of a non-trivial $(\mathbf{R},+)$ principal bundle $\pi: \mathrm{W}_\alpha \to \mathrm{D}_\alpha$ within the framework of diffeology, where the base space $\mathrm{D}_\alpha$ is smoothly contractible. This stands in stark contrast to classical bundle theory over manifolds, where such bundles are always trivial, as well as principal fiber bundles with contractible fiber. The non-triviality is shown to stem from a fundamental obstruction to the existence of a smooth connection, in the broad sense of diffeology, a property universally available in the classical setting. We provide a direct proof of this obstruction, demonstrating why homotopy is an insufficient tool for classifying diffeological bundles.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of weak almost ${\mathcal S}$-manifolds with curvature properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interest of geometers in $f$-structures is motivated by the study of the dynamics of contact foliations, as well as their applications in physics. A weak $f$-structure on a smooth manifold, introduced by V. Rovenski and R. Wolak (2022), generalizes K. Yano's (1961) $f$-structure. This generalization allows us to revisit classical theory and discover new applications related to Killing vector fields, totally geodesic foliations, Ricci-type solitons, and Einstein-type metrics. In this paper, we investigate some fundamental curvature properties of weak almost $\mathcal{S}$-manifolds and examine those satisfying the condition ``the curvature tensor in the directions of the Reeb vector fields is zero", as well as its generalization, the $(\kappa, \mu)$-nullity condition. We~find when a weak almost ${\mathcal S}$-manifold satisfying this curvature tensor condition admits two complementary orthogo\-nal foliations, both of which are totally geodesic, with one being flat (in the (2+s)-dimensional case, the manifold is flat). We also characterize weak almost ${\mathcal S}$-manifolds, which in the case of the $f$-$(1,\mu)$-nullity condition become ${\cal S}$-manifolds; this agrees with the results of B. Cappelletti Montano and L. Di Terlizzi (2007) on $f$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Stability of spinorial Sobolev inequalities on $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinorial Sobolev inequality on the unit sphere states \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq 0, \end{equation*} with equality if and only if $\psi \in {\mathcal M}$, the set of all $-\frac 12$-Killing spinors and their conformal transformations.
  Our main result in this paper is to refine this inequality by establishing a stability inequality
  \begin{equation*} \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq {\bf c}_S\inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{M}}\Big(\int| D(\psi-\phi)|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}.
  \end{equation*}
  As a by-product of our argument, we show that elements in set $\mathcal M$ are not optimizers of another spinorial Sobolev inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}} \geq C_S \Big(\int|\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n-1}}\Big)^{\frac{n-1}{n}},
  \end{equation*}
  unlike expected by experts. They have in fact index $n+1$ and nullity $2^{[\frac n2]+2}$.</description>

      <title>The stability index and Yau's conjecture for Carlotto-Schulz minimal hypertori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, for any n&gt;1, Carlotto and Schulz showed the existence of a minimal embedding in the 2n-dimensional unit sphere. In this paper, we show that the stability index of these embedded minimal hypersurfaces is at least 6n+3. We also show that Yau's conjecture holds for these examples if and only if the solution of the differential equation z''(t)+a_n(t)z'(t)+(2n-1)z(t)=0 with z(0)=1 and z'(0)=0 satisfies z'(T)&gt;0. Here,T and the T-periodic function a_n(t) are determined in terms of the functions defining the minimal immersion.</description>

      <title>Covariance as a commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The covariance between real finite variance random variables can be expressed as the commutator of taking expectations and multiplying, both viewed as operators extended to act jointly on pairs of functions. The efficient influence curve of the mean represents a centering operator which we demonstrate to interact with expectations and products through simple commutator identities. These expressions reveal an underlying Lie algebraic structure that endows the calculus of efficient influence curves with a natural differential geometric interpretation.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>Jiggling: an h-principle without homotopical assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jiggling lemma of Thurston shows that any triangulation can be jiggled (read: subdivided and then perturbed) to be in general position with respect to a distribution. Our main result is a generalization of Thurston's lemma. It states that piecewise smooth solutions of a given open and fiberwise dense differential relation $\mathcal{R} \subset J^1(E)$ of first order can be constructed by jiggling arbitrary sections of $E$. Our statement also holds in parametric and relative form. We understand this as an h-principle without homotopical assumptions for piecewise smooth solutions of $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

      <title>Graph discretization of Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds with bounds on Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the approximation of eigenvalues for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on closed Riemannian manifolds in the class $\MMM$, characterized by bounded Ricci curvature, a lower bound on the injectivity radius, and an upper bound on the diameter. We use an $(\epsilon,\rho)$-approximation of the manifold by a weighted graph, as introduced by Burago et al. By adapting their methods, we prove that as the parameters $\epsilon, \rho$ and the ratio $\frac{\epsilon}{\rho}$ approach zero, the $k$-th eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian converges uniformly to the $k$-th eigenvalue of the manifold's Laplacian for each $k$.</description>

      <title>Nearly geodesic surfaces are filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold. A homotopy class $[S]$ of surfaces in $M$ is filling if any representative cuts $M$ into components contractible in $M$. We prove that there exist $\epsilon_0, g_0&gt;0$ such that every homotopy class of $(1+\epsilon)$-quasi-Fuchsian surfaces with $0&lt;\epsilon\leq \epsilon_0$ or totally geodesic surfaces of genus $\geq g_0$ in $M$ is filling. As a corollary, except for at most finitely many totally geodesic surfaces, embedded incompressible quasi-Fuchsian surfaces in $M$ have constants bounded below by $1+\epsilon_0$. This also gives a gap theorem for embedded minimal surfaces. Each of these surfaces separates any pair of distinct points at the sphere of infinity. Crucial tools include the rigidity results of Mozes-Shah, Ratner, and Shah. This work is inspired by a question of Wu and Xue whether random geodesics on random hyperbolic surfaces are filling.</description>
