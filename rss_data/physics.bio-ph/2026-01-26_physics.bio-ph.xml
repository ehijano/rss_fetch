      <title>Magnetic Nanoparticles as Label-Free Dual-Function Nanoheaters and Nanothermometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat generation and temperature reading at the nanoscale have attracted increasing attention due to their direct relevance in thermal therapeutic approaches. Consequently, huge progress has been made toward the design of dual-function nanoplatforms that integrate heating and thermometry capabilities at the nanoscale. However, in most cases, dual nanoheater nanothermometer platforms rely either on specifically engineered materials or on complex readout schemes, which limits translational potential due to complex implementation procedures. To overcome these challenges, we present a methodology for directly extracting temperature information based on dynamical magnetization measurements of cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoflowers. We demonstrate that these nanocrystals monitor temperature changes through variations in their magnetization cycles measured under alternating magnetic fields. Importantly, this thermometric functionality is preserved after surface functionalization and under chemical variations in the nanoparticle environment. Interestingly, we show that we can simultaneously generate heat and report temperature changes within the same agent. This is thanks to the photothermal conversion of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles subjected to near infrared irradiation and the tight reported relationship between magnetization dynamics and Brownian relaxation. Together, these results establish cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoparticles as a label-free platform for simultaneous heat generation and intrinsic temperature readout, enabling real-time nanoscale thermal control.</description>

      <title>Negative Pressure and Cavitation Dynamics in Plant-like Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a solid (e.g. wood or rubber) can be put under tensile stress by pulling on it. Once a critical stress is overcome, the solid breaks, leaving an empty space. Similarly, due to internal cohesion, a liquid can withstand tension (i.e. negative pressure), up to a critical point where a large bubble spontaneously forms, releasing the tension and leaving a void (the bubble). This process is known as cavitation. While water at negative pressure is metastable, such a state can be long-lived. In fact, water under tension is found routinely in the plant kingdom, as a direct effect of dehydration, e.g. by evaporation. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of occurrences of water stress and cavitation in plants, then use a simple thermodynamic and fluid mechanical framework to describe the basic physics of water stress and cavitation. We focus specifically on situations close to those in plants, that is water at negative pressure nested within a structure that is solid, but porous and potentially deformable. We also discuss insights from these simple models as well as from experiments with artificial structures mimicking some essential aspects of the structures found within plants.</description>

Abstract: We present a rapid, large-field bimodal imaging platform that integrates conventional brightfield microscopy with a lensless IR imaging scanner, enabling whole-slide IR image stack acquisition in minutes. Using a dedicated deep learning model, we implement an optical HE staining strategy based on subcellular morpho-spectral fingerprinting.</description>

      <title>Optimizing information transmission in optogenetic Wnt signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Populations of cells regulate gene expression in response to external signals, but their ability to make reliable collective decisions is limited by both intrinsic noise in molecular signaling and variability between individual cells. In this work, we use optogenetic control of the canonical Wnt pathway as an example to study how reliably information about an external signal is transmitted to a population of cells, and determine an optimal encoding strategy to maximize information transmission from Wnt signals to gene expression. We find that it is possible to reach an information capacity beyond 1 bit only through an appropriate, discrete encoding of signals: using either no Wnt, a short Wnt pulse, or a sustained Wnt signal. By averaging over an increasing number of outputs, we systematically vary the effective noise in the pathway. As the effective noise decreases, the optimal encoding comprises more discrete input signals. These signals do not need to be fine-tuned to achieve near-optimal information transmission. The optimal code transitions into a continuous code in the small-noise limit, which can be shown to be consistent with the Jeffreys prior. We visualize the performance of different signal encodings using decoding maps. Our results suggest optogenetic Wnt signaling allows for regulatory control beyond a simple binary switch, and provides a framework to apply ideas from information processing to single-cell in vitro experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability and kinetic control of capsid morphologies in hepatitis B virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymorphism has been observed in viral capsid assembly, demonstrating the ability of identical protein dimers to adopt multiple geometries under the same solution conditions. A well-studied example is the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which forms two stable capsid morphologies both in vivo and in vitro. These capsids differ in diameter, containing either 90 or 120 protein dimers. Experiments have shown that their relative prevalence depends on the ionic conditions of the solution during assembly. We developed a model that incorporates salt effects by altering the intermolecular binding free energy between capsid proteins, thereby shifting the relative thermodynamic stability of the two morphologies. This model reproduces experimental results on the prevalence ratios of the large and small HBV capsids. We also constructed a kinetic model that captures the time-dependent ratio of the two morphologies under subcritical capsid concentrations, consistent with experimental data.</description>
