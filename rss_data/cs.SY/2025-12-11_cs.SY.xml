      <title>Kinematics Control of Electromagnetic Formation Flight Using Angular-Momentum Conservation Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) uses the electromagnetic force to control the relative positions of multiple satellites without using conventional fuel-based propulsion. To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes non-uniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control $n$ satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Human Feedback-Based Control in Naturalistic Driving Interactions via Gaussian Process Regression with Linear Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding driver interactions is critical to designing autonomous vehicles to interoperate safely with human-driven cars. We consider the impact of these interactions on the policies drivers employ when navigating unsigned intersections in a driving simulator. The simulator allows the collection of naturalistic decision-making and behavior data in a controlled environment. Using these data, we model the human driver responses as state-based feedback controllers learned via Gaussian Process regression methods. We compute the feedback gain of the controller using a weighted combination of linear and nonlinear priors. We then analyze how the individual gains are reflected in driver behavior. We also assess differences in these controllers across populations of drivers. Our work in data-driven analyses of how drivers determine their policies can facilitate future work in the design of socially responsive autonomy for vehicles.</description>

      <title>MPC for momentum counter-balanced and zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In on-orbit robotics, a servicer satellite's ability to make contact with a free-spinning target satellite is essential to completing most on-orbit servicing (OOS) tasks. This manuscript develops a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that generates feasible controls for a servicer satellite to achieve zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning target satellite. The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise.</description>

      <title>Electric Arc Furnaces Scheduling under Electricity Price Volatility with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework for optimizing the operation of electric arc furnaces (EAFs) under volatile electricity prices. We formulate the deterministic version of the EAF scheduling problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and then develop a Q-learning algorithm to perform real-time control of multiple EAF units under real-time price volatility and shared feeding capacity constraints. We design a custom reward function for the Q-learning algorithm to smooth the start-up penalties of the EAFs. Using real data from EAF designs and electricity prices in New York State, we benchmark our algorithm against a baseline rule-based controller and a MILP benchmark, assuming perfect price forecasts. The results show that our reinforcement learning algorithm achieves around 90% of the profit compared to the perfect MILP benchmark in various single-unit and multi-unit cases under a non-anticipatory control setting.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Frequency and Voltage Strength in Power Electronics-Dominated Power Systems Based on Eigen-subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has deteriorated the frequency/voltage (F/V) responses of power systems, leading to a higher risk of instability. Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Resilience Testing for Decision-Making Agents with Dual-Mode Surrogate Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing and evaluating decision-making agents remains challenging due to unknown system architectures, limited access to internal states, and the vastness of high-dimensional scenario spaces. Existing testing approaches often rely on surrogate models of decision-making agents to generate large-scale scenario libraries; however, discrepancies between surrogate models and real decision-making agents significantly limit their generalizability and practical applicability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes intelligent resilience testing (IRTest), a unified online adaptive testing framework designed to rapidly adjust to diverse decision-making agents. IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents.</description>

      <title>Time-Discretized Simulation of Vehicle Platoons for Safety Analysis with Guaranteed Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication is essential to achieve coordinated control in vehicle platoons. However, packet losses in wireless communication can cause critical safety issues when they occur in conjunction with sudden brakes. In this paper, we propose simulation-based methods that allow the study of such safety issues by determining the absolute minimum distance between vehicles over time for various control parameters that guarantee string stability. For our proposed time-discretized simulations, we provide two methods for selecting different time-step intervals to ensure that the error in distance approximation remains within specified bounds at all times. Through numerical examples we demonstrate that among control parameters that guarantee string stability some perform better than others under simultaneously occurring packet losses and sudden brakes.</description>

      <title>Power Control of Multi-Layer Repeater Networks (POLARNet)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we introduce POLARNet -- power control of multi-layer repeater networks -- for local optimization of SNR given different repeater power constraints. We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers.</description>

      <title>Personalized Building Climate Control with Contextual Preferential Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient tuning of building climate controllers to optimize occupant utility is essential for ensuring overall comfort and satisfaction. However, this is a challenging task since the latent utility are difficult to measure directly. Time-varying contextual factors, such as outdoor temperature, further complicate the problem. To address these challenges, we propose a contextual preferential Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages binary preference feedback together with contextual information to enable efficient real-time controller tuning. We validate the approach by tuning an economic MPC controller on BOPTEST, a high-fidelity building simulation platform. Over a two-month simulation period, our method outperforms the baseline controller and achieves an improvement of up to 23% in utility. Moreover, for different occupant types, we demonstrate that the algorithm automatically adapts to individual preferences, enabling personalized controller tuning.</description>

Abstract: This letter seeks to clarify the different existing definitions of both instantaneous complex phase and frequency as well as their equivalence when specific hypotheses hold. To achieve this, the two fundamental definitions, i.e., those based on either the use of (i) analytic signals or (ii) space vectors, together with the premises used for their formulation, are presented and their relationship shown. Lastly, an unified notation and terminology to avoid confusion is proposed.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Non-Smooth MPC for Switching Systems: Application to a Three-Tank Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time model predictive control of non-smooth switching systems remains challenging due to discontinuities and the presence of discrete modes, which complicate numerical integration and optimization. This paper presents a real-time feasible non-smooth model predictive control scheme for a physical three-tank process, implemented without mixed-integer formulations. The approach combines Filippov system modeling with finite elements and switch detection for time discretization, leading to a finite-dimensional optimal control problem formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. The mathematical program is solved via a homotopy of smooth nonlinear programs. We introduce modeling adjustments that make the three-tank dynamics numerically tractable, including additional modes to avoid non-Lipschitz points and undefined function values. Hardware experiments demonstrate efficient handling of switching events, mode-consistent tracking across reference changes, correct boundary handling, and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of model mismatch and show that the tracking performance and computation times remain within real-time limits for the chosen sampling time. The complete controller is implemented using the non-smooth optimal control framework NOSNOC</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Coordinated Multi-Point ISAC for Low-Altitude Sensing Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) has emerged and developed in various fields, which has gained considerable interest. To ensure the security of LAE, it is essential to establish a proper sensing coverage scheme for monitoring the unauthorized targets. Introducing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) into cellular networks is a promising solution that enables coordinated multiple base stations (BSs) to significantly enhance sensing performance and extend coverage. Meanwhile, deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can mitigate signal blockages between BSs and low-altitude targets in urban areas. Therefore, this paper focuses on the low-altitude sensing coverage problem in RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point ISAC networks, where a RIS is employed to enable multiple BSs to sense a prescribed region while serving multiple communication users. A joint beamforming and phase shifts design is proposed to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing sensing signal-to-noise ratio and communication spectral efficiency. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by using the alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation techniques. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over the baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Optimal Control for Avatar-Guided Motor Rehabilitation in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control-theoretic framework for autonomous avatar-guided rehabilitation in virtual reality, based on interpretable, adaptive motor guidance through optimal control, is presented. The framework faces critical challenges in motor rehabilitation due to accessibility, cost, and continuity of care, with over 50% of patients inability to attend regular clinic sessions. The system enables post-stroke patients to undergo personalized therapy in immersive virtual reality at home, while being monitored by clinicians. The core is a nonlinear, human-in-the-loop control strategy, where the avatar adapts in real time to the patient's performance. Balance between following the patient's movements and guiding them to ideal kinematic profiles based on the Hogan minimum-jerk model is achieved through multi-objective optimal control. A data-driven "ability index" uses smoothness metrics to dynamically adjust control gains according to the patient's progress. The system was validated through simulations and preliminary trials, and shows potential for delivering adaptive, engaging and scalable remote physiotherapy guided by interpretable control-theoretic principles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a conceptual study on the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for decentralized control of unmanned aerial vehicles to relay a critical data package to a known position. For this purpose, a family of deterministic games is introduced, designed for scaling studies for MARL. A robust baseline policy is proposed, which is based on restricting agent motion envelopes and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. Experimental results show that two off-the-shelf MARL algorithms perform competitively with the baseline for a small number of agents, but scalability issues arise as the number of agents increase.</description>

      <title>Resilient Neural-Variable-Structure Consensus Control for Nonlinear MASs with Singular Input Gain Under DoS Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reliable learning-based adaptive control framework for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and singular control gains, two critical challenges in cyber-physical systems. A neural-variable-structure adaptive controller is developed to achieve leader-follower consensus while ensuring robustness to external disturbances and adaptability to unknown nonlinear dynamics. A reliability-assessment rule is introduced to detect communication loss during DoS attacks, upon which a switched control mechanism is activated to preserve closed-loop stability and performance. Unlike existing resilient MAS control methods, the proposed strategy explicitly accommodates singular control gains and does not rely on restrictive assumptions such as Lipschitz continuity or prior bounds on nonlinearities. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to integrate neural learning, variable-structure robustness, and reliability-based switching into a unified consensus-tracking control architecture for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs with singular input gains under DoS attacks. Lyapunov-based analysis establishes uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals, and Matlab/Simulink simulations on a connected automated vehicle platoon demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resilience.</description>

      <title>Cyqlone: A Parallel, High-Performance Linear Solver for Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Cyqlone, a solver for linear systems with a stage-wise optimal control structure that fully exploits the various levels of parallelism available in modern hardware. Cyqlone unifies algorithms based on the sequential Riccati recursion, parallel Schur complement methods, and cyclic reduction methods, thereby minimizing the required number of floating-point operations, while allowing parallelization across a user-configurable number of processors. Given sufficient parallelism, the solver run time scales with the logarithm of the horizon length (in contrast to the linear scaling of sequential Riccati-based methods), enabling real-time solution of long-horizon problems. Beyond multithreading on multi-core processors, implementations of Cyqlone can also leverage vectorization using batched linear algebra routines. Such batched routines exploit data parallelism using single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations, and expose a higher degree of instruction-level parallelism than their non-batched counterparts. This enables them to significantly outperform BLAS and BLASFEO for the small matrices that arise in optimal control. Building on this high-performance linear solver, we develop CyQPALM, a parallel and optimal-control-specific variant of the QPALM quadratic programming solver. It combines the parallel and vectorized linear algebra operations from Cyqlone with a parallel line search and parallel factorization updates, resulting in order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HPIPM solver. Open-source C++ implementations of Cyqlone and CyQPALM are available at https://github.com/kul-optec/cyqlone</description>

      <title>A tensor phase theory with applications in multilinear control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to initiate a phase theory for tensors under the Einstein product, and explore its applications in multilinear control systems. Firstly, the sectorial tensor decomposition for sectorial tensors is derived, which allows us to define phases for sectorial tensors. A numerical procedure for computing phases of a sectorial tensor is also proposed. Secondly, the maximin and minimax expressions for tensor phases are given, which are used to quantify how close the phases of a sectorial tensor are to those of its compressions. Thirdly, the compound spectrum, compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of two sectorial tensors $A,B$ are defined and characterized in terms of the compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of the sectorial tensors $A,B$. Fourthly, it is shown that the angles of eigenvalues of the product of two sectorial tensors are upper bounded by the sum of their individual phases. Finally, based on the tensor phase theory developed above, a tensor version of the small phase theorem is presented, which can be regarded as a natural generalization of the matrix case, recently proposed in Ref. [10]. The results offer powerful new tools for the stability and robustness analysis of multilinear feedback control systems.</description>

      <title>An Automated Tip-and-Cue Framework for Optimized Satellite Tasking and Visual Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of satellite constellations, coupled with reduced tasking latency and diverse sensor capabilities, has expanded the opportunities for automated Earth observation. This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical.</description>

      <title>Visual Heading Prediction for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is increasingly central to the development of intelligent autonomous systems for applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics. However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506{\deg} and a root mean squared error of 0.1957{\deg}, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions. A demonstration video showcasing the system's real-time performance, including UGV detection, heading angle prediction, and UAV alignment under dynamic conditions, is available at: https://github.com/Kooroshraf/UAV-UGV-Integration</description>

      <title>Link-Sharing Backpressure Routing In Wireless Multi-Hop Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is an established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, noted for its fully distributed operation and maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walks, yet exclusive link-level commodity selection still causes last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. By revisiting the Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP, we show that the legacy exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and propose a Maximum Utility (MaxU) link-sharing method to expand its performance envelope without increasing control message overhead. Numerical results show that MaxU SP-BP substantially mitigates the last-packet problem and slightly expands the network capacity region.</description>

      <title>Control Node Placement and Structural Controllability of Water Quality Dynamics in Drinking Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant, needs to be adequately distributed in water distribution networks (WDNs) to maintain consistent residual levels and ensure safe water. This is performed through control node injections at the treatment plant via booster stations distributed across the WDNs. While previous studies have applied various optimization-based approaches for booster station placement, many have failed to consider the coverage of the station injections and the dynamic nature of WDNs. In particular, variations in hydraulics and demand significantly impact the reachability and efficacy of chlorine injections which then impact optimal placement of booster stations. This study introduces a novel formulation that combines control- and graph-theoretic approaches to solve the booster station placement problem. Unlike traditional methods, our approach emphasizes maximizing the system's ability to control disinfectant levels with minimal control energy, taking into account the time-varying hydraulic profiles that lead to different optimal station placements. We propose a simple weighting technique to determine the placements by assessing the structural controllability of each configuration, based on the network's topology, independent of specific parameters like decay rates or pipe roughness. This method ensures effective chlorine coverage across the network. Our approach is validated on different networks, demonstrating its operational effectiveness, scalability, and practicality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a system identification algorithm for systems with multi-rate sensors in a discrete-time framework. It is challenging to obtain an accurate mathematical model when the ratios of inputs and outputs are different in the system. A cyclic reformulation-based model for multi-rate systems is formulated, and the multi-rate system can be reduced to a linear time-invariant system to derive the model under the multi-rate sensing environment. The proposed algorithm integrates a cyclic reformulation with a state coordinate transformation of the cycled system to enable precise identification of systems under the multi-rate sensing environment. The effectiveness of the proposed system identification method is demonstrated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Learning in Stackelberg Games with an Application to Electric Ride-Hailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently learning to play single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg games when the leader lacks knowledge of the lower-level game. Such games arise in hierarchical decision-making problems involving self-interested agents. For example, in electric ride-hailing markets, a central authority aims to learn optimal charging prices to shape fleet distributions and charging patterns of ride-hailing companies. Existing works typically apply gradient-based methods to find the leader's optimal strategy. Such methods are impractical as they require that the followers share private utility information with the leader. Instead, we treat the lower-level game as a black box, assuming only that the followers' interactions approximate a Nash equilibrium while the leader observes the realized cost of the resulting approximation. Under kernel-based regularity assumptions on the leader's cost function, we develop a no-regret algorithm that converges to an $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium in $O(\sqrt{T})$ rounds. Finally, we validate our approach through a numerical case study on optimal pricing in electric ride-hailing markets.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Model Predictive Control with Online Learning of Koopman Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a problem of simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. Particularly, we provide an algorithm for systems with unknown residual dynamics that can be expressed by Koopman operators. Such residual dynamics can model external disturbances and modeling errors, such as wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal non-causal controller. Specifically, the algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown dynamics will adapt to its states and actions. To this end, we assume the algorithm is given Koopman observable functions such that the unknown dynamics can be approximated by a linear dynamical system. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown residual dynamics. This model is updated online using least squares in a self-supervised manner based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in physics-based simulations of a cart-pole system aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters.</description>

Abstract: Controllers designed with reinforcement learning can be sensitive to model mismatch. We demonstrate that designing such controllers in a virtual simulation environment with an inaccurate model is not suitable for deployment in a physical setup. Controllers designed using an accurate model is robust against disturbance and small mismatch between the physical setup and the mathematical model derived from first principles; while a poor model results in a controller that performs well in simulation but fails in physical experiments. Sensitivity analysis is used to justify these discrepancies and an empirical region of attraction estimation help us visualize their robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a model-free adaptive control approach to suppress vibrations in a cantilevered beam excited by an unknown disturbance. The cantilevered beam under harmonic excitation is modeled using a lumped parameter approach. Based on retrospective cost optimization, a sampled-data adaptive controller is developed to suppress vibrations caused by external disturbances. Both displacement and acceleration measurements are considered for feedback. Since acceleration measurements are more sensitive to spillover, which excites higher frequency modes, a filter is developed to extract key displacement information from the acceleration data and enhance suppression performance. The vibration suppression performance is compared using both displacement and acceleration measurements.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance.
  This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations.
  Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor (CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a noise-centric formulation of the distributionally robust Kalman filter (DRKF) for discrete-time linear stochastic systems with uncertain noise statistics. By placing Wasserstein ambiguity sets directly on the process and measurement noise distributions, the proposed DRKF preserves the analytical structure of the classical Kalman filter while providing a priori spectral bounds on all feasible covariances. In the time-invariant setting, we derive a steady-state DRKF from a single stationary semidefinite program, yielding a constant-gain estimator with the same per-step computational complexity as the standard Kalman filter. We establish conditions guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of this steady-state solution, and we prove its asymptotic minimax optimality with respect to the worst-case mean-square error. Numerical experiments validate the theory and demonstrate that the proposed DRKF improves estimation accuracy under unknown or uncertain noise models while offering computational advantages over existing robust and distributionally robust filters.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents CARTOS, a charging-aware real-time operating system designed to enhance the functionality of intermittently-powered batteryless devices (IPDs) for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. While IPDs offer significant advantages such as extended lifespan and operability in extreme environments, they pose unique challenges, including the need to ensure forward progress of program execution amidst variable energy availability and maintaining reliable real-time time behavior during power disruptions. To address these challenges, CARTOS introduces a mixed-preemption scheduling model that classifies tasks into computational and peripheral tasks, and ensures their efficient and timely execution by adopting just-in-time checkpointing for divisible computation tasks and uninterrupted execution for indivisible peripheral tasks. CARTOS also supports processing chains of tasks with precedence constraints and adapts its scheduling in response to environmental changes to offer continuous execution under diverse conditions. CARTOS is implemented with new APIs and components added to FreeRTOS but is designed for portability to other embedded RTOSs. Through real hardware experiments and simulations, CARTOS exhibits superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that it can serve as a practical platform for developing resilient, real-time sensing applications on IPDs.</description>

      <title>C*: A Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments using Rapidly Covering Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13782</link>

Abstract: The paper presents a novel sample-based algorithm, called C*, for real-time coverage path planning (CPP) of unknown environments. C* is built upon the concept of a Rapidly Covering Graph (RCG), which is incrementally constructed during robot navigation via progressive sampling of the search space. By using efficient sampling and pruning techniques, the RCG is constructed to be a minimum-sufficient graph, where its nodes and edges form the potential waypoints and segments of the coverage trajectory, respectively. The RCG tracks the coverage progress, generates the coverage trajectory and helps the robot to escape from the dead-end situations. To minimize coverage time, C* produces the desired back-and-forth coverage pattern, while adapting to the TSP-based optimal coverage of local isolated regions, called coverage holes, which are surrounded by obstacles and covered regions. It is analytically proven that C* provides complete coverage of unknown environments. The algorithmic simplicity and low computational complexity of C* make it easy to implement and suitable for real-time on-board applications. The performance of C* is validated by 1) extensive high-fidelity simulations and 2) laboratory experiments using an autonomous robot. C* yields near optimal trajectories, and a comparative evaluation with seven existing CPP methods demonstrates significant improvements in performance in terms of coverage time, number of turns, trajectory length, and overlap ratio, while preventing the formation of coverage holes. Finally, C* is comparatively evaluated on two different CPP applications using 1) energy-constrained robots and 2) multi-robot teams.</description>

      <title>Hybrid A* Path Planning with Multi-Modal Motion Extension for Four-Wheel Steering Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of 4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A* framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex environments.</description>
