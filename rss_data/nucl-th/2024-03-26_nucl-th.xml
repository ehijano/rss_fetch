      <title>Exploring the Big Bang with femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the fundamental constituents of the matter around us and in the Universe, as well as their interactions, is among the premier goals of physics. Investigating ultrarelativistic collisions in particle accelerators has delivered answers to these questions many times in the past decades. In this paper we focus on the research aimed at recreating the matter that filled the Universe in the first microsecond after the Big Bang -- but this time in collisions of heavy ions. In particular we discuss the technique called femtoscopy, which provides us a tool to understand the space-time structure of particle creation in heavy-ion collisions. We utilize Levy-stable distributions to investigate this structure and explore its dependence on particle momentum and collision energy.</description>

      <title>Heaven and Earth: Nuclear Astrophysics after GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The historical detection of gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 is providing fundamental new insights into the astrophysical site for the creation of the heaviest elements in the cosmos and on the equation of state of neutron-rich matter. Shortly after this historical detection, electromagnetic observations of neutron stars together with measurements of the properties of neutron-rich nuclei at terrestrial facilities have placed additional constraints on the dynamics of neutron-rich matter. It is this unique synergy between heaven and earth that is the focus of this article.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Systematic Trends in Nuclear Data with Generative Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for studying systematic trends in nuclear reaction data using generative adversarial networks. Libraries of nuclear cross section evaluations exhibit intricate systematic trends across the nuclear landscape, and predictive models capable of reproducing and analyzing these trends are valuable for many applications. We have developed a predictive model using deep generative adversarial networks to learn trends from the inelastic neutron scattering channel of TENDL for even-even nuclei. The system predicts cross sections based on adding/subtracting particles to/from the target nucleus. It can thus help identify cross sections that break from expected trends and predict beyond the limit of current experiments. Our model can produce good predictions for cross section curves for many nuclides, and it is most robust near the line of stability. We also create an ensemble of predictions to leverage different correlations and estimate model uncertainty. This research marks an important first step in computer generation of nuclear cross-section libraries.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, encompassing light-flavor, strange-flavor, and light nuclei produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). By conducting a thermal analysis of hadron yields with and without the inclusion of light nuclei yields, we observe a discernible decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ when light nuclei yields are considered. This suggests that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage of the system evolution. Furthermore, the $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ associated with strange-flavor particles is found to be approximately $20-30$ MeV higher than that for light-flavor particles and light nuclei, hinting at the existence of multiple freeze-out hyper-surfaces for different hadron types in heavy-ion collisions. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and $\mu_B$ for four distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions. These formulas allow for the selection of appropriate parameters tailored to specific studies, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the freeze-out process.</description>

      <title>Limits on an improved action for contact effective field theory in two-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a possible resummation of subleading effects in two-body systems with a large scattering length as described by a short-range effective field theory (EFT). In particular, we investigate the consequences of a resummation of part of the range corrections. Explicit calculations of the two-body phase shifts and charge form factor indicate that, except for extreme choices, resummations do not alter the convergence of the EFT expansion and are often beneficial at lowest orders. We have considered the expansion when the regulator cutoff is removed as well as when it is finite, and find that the cutoff is not an important factor for resummations. Our results connect with other works where the partial resummation is induced by potentials with finite cutoffs or interaction ranges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an enhanced machine learning method to calculate the ground state of two-body systems. Compared to the original method [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)], the present method enables one to consider the spin and isospin degrees of freedom by employing a non-fully-connected deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The validity of this method is verified by calculating the unique bound state of deuteron.</description>

      <title>Tuned electron-nucleus resonance as a tool of producing the 229mTh isomer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of refining the energy of the 8.36-eV 229mTh nuclear isomer -- the most likely candidate for the role of a nuclear frequency standard -- by means of resonant optical pumping is discussed. Attention is focused on considering the broadening of the resonance in order to reduce scanning time. The two-photon method proposed exploits the radical broadening of the isomer line due to mixing with the electron transition. This is not burdened with the cross-section reduction, in contrast with internal-conversion-based resonance broadening or intended extra-broadening of the spectral line of a pumping laser. In the case under consideration, according to the calculations, it turns out to be two orders of magnitude more efficient. It is applicable to both ionized and neutral thorium atoms. Realization of the method supposes excitation of the both nucleus and electron shell in the final state.</description>

      <title>Scalar field with a time-independent classical source, not trivial after all: from vacuum decay to scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum, conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance dilaton production in a medium.</description>

      <title>From pole parameters to line shapes and branching ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonances are uniquely characterized by their complex pole locations and the corresponding residues. In practice, however, resonances are typically identified experimentally as structures in invariant mass distributions, with branching fractions of resonances determined as ratios of count rates. To make contact between these quantities it is necessary to connect line shapes and resonance parameters. In this work we propose such a connection and illustrate the formalism with detailed studies of the $\rho(770)$ and $f_0(500)$ resonances. Based on the line shapes inferred from the resonance parameters along these lines, expressions for partial widths and branching ratios are derived and compared to other approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium suppression from the three-loop QCD potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the suppression of bottomonium in the quark-gluon plasma using the three-loop QCD static potential. The potential describes the spin-averaged bottomonium spectrum below threshold with a less than 1% error. Within potential nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and an open quantum systems framework, we compute the evolution of the bottomonium density matrix. The values of the quarkonium transport coefficients are obtained from lattice QCD measurements of the bottomonium in-medium width and thermal mass shift; we additionally include for the first time a vacuum contribution to the dispersive coefficient ${\gamma}$. Using the three-loop potential and the values of the heavy quarkonium transport coefficients, we find that the resulting bottomonium nuclear modification factor is consistent with experimental observations, while at the same time reproducing the lattice measurements of the in-medium width.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics from quantum nonlinear projection operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics based on the method of quantum nonlinear projection operator. Morozov's nonlinear projection operator is a generalization of the well-known linear Mori-Zwanzig projection operator method, from which one can account for the nonlinear interaction between macroscopic modes. The quantum generalized Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations are also obtained using this formalism, which are fundamentally important in non-equilibrium statistical physics. As an application, the relativistic stochastic hydrodynamic equations with Gaussian noises are derived, which are applicable in studying anomalous transport phenomena near critical points. The possible extension to include multiplicative noises is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint to explain the experimental data of neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for all those experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis Force on Electrical Conductivity Tensor for Rotating Hadron Resonance Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the influence of the Coriolis force on the electrical conductivity of hadronic matter formed in relativistic nuclear collisions, employing the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model. A rotating matter in the peripheral heavy ion collisions can be expected from the initial stage of quark matter to late-stage hadronic matter. Present work is focused on rotating hadronic matter, whose medium constituents - hadron resonances can face a non-zero Coriolis force, which can influence the hadronic flow or conductivity. We estimate this conductivity tensor by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation. In the absence of Coriolis force, an isotropic conductivity tensor for hadronic matter is expected. However, our study finds that the presence of Coriolis force can generate an anisotropic conductivity tensor with three main conductivity components - parallel, perpendicular, and Hall, similar to the effect of Lorentz force at a finite magnetic field. Our study has indicated that a noticeable anisotropy of conductivity tensor can be found within the phenomenological range of angular velocity $\Omega= 0.001-0.02$ GeV and hadronic scattering radius $a=0.2-2$ fm.</description>

      <title>A novel quark pairing in sQGP induced by the non-Abelian feature of the interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for quark propagator and quark gluon vertex in the Nambu-Gorkov basis which is widely applied to study the color superconductivity. After considering the non-Abelian feature in the off-diagonal part of quark gluon vertex, we acquire a quark pairing gap in chiral limit above the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$. The gap persists up to $2-3\,T_c$ and vanishes at higher temperature. Such a quark pairing characterizes the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma phase as a new phase and distinct from the phase with quasi quarks and gluons. Its new features can be disclosed in the heavy ion collision experiments.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic fluctuations and topological susceptibility in chiral magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnetohydrodynamics is devoted to understanding the late-time and long-distance behavior of a system with an Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly at finite temperatures. The non-conservation of the axial charge is determined by the topological density $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$; in a classical hydrodynamic description this decay rate can be suppressed by tuning the background magnetic field to zero. However it is in principle possible for thermal fluctuations of $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$ to result in a non-conservation of the charge even at vanishing $B$-field; this would invalidate the classical hydrodynamic effective theory. We investigate this by computing the real-time susceptibility of the topological density at one-loop level in magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations, relating its low-frequency limit to the decay rate of the axial charge. We find that the frequency-dependence of this susceptibility is sufficiently soft as to leave the axial decay rate unaffected, validating the classical hydrodynamic description. We show that the susceptibility contains non-analytic frequency-dependence which is universally determined by hydrodynamic data. We comment briefly on possible connections to the recent formulation of the ABJ anomaly in terms of non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis force on the shear viscosity of quark matter: A nonrelativistic description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shear viscosity becomes anisotropic in a rotating medium. It is discovered here that for rotating thermalized quantum systems such as those created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the coeffficient of shear viscosity breaks up into five independent components. Similar phenomena were also discovered for quark-gluon plasma in the presence of the magnetic field. Like the Lorentz force at a finite magnetic field, the Coriolis force also creates anisotropic viscosity at nonzero rotation. As a first approach, for simplicity, the calculations are done in the nonrelativistic prescription, with a future proposal to extend it toward a relativistic description. Introducing the Coriolis force term in relaxation time approximated Boltzmann transport equation, we have found different effective relaxation times along the parallel, perpendicular, and Hall directions in terms of actual relaxation time and rotating time period. Comparing the present formalism with the finite magnetic field picture, we have shown the equivalence of roles between the rotating and cyclotron time periods, where the rotating time period is inverse of twice the angular velocity.</description>

      <title>Towards $\it{ab}$-$\it{initio}$ nuclear theory calculations of $\delta_\mathrm{C}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new theory framework to study the isospin-symmetry breaking correction $\delta_\text{C}$ in superallowed nuclear beta decays, crucial for the precise determination of $|V_{ud}|$. Based on a general assumptions of the isovector dominance in ISB interactions, we construct a set of functions $F_{T_z}$ which involve nuclear matrix elements of isovector monopole operators and the nuclear Green's function. Via the functions $F_{T_z}$, a connection of $\delta_\text{C}$ to measurable electroweak nuclear radii is established, providing an experimental gauge of the theory accuracy of $\delta_\text{C}$. We outline a strategy to perform ab-initio calculations of $F_{T_z}$ based on the Lanczos algorithm, and discuss its similarity with other nuclear-structure-dependent inputs in nuclear beta decays.</description>

      <title>Thermal phonon fluctuations and stability of the magnetic dual chiral density wave phase in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability against thermal phonon fluctuations of the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase, an inhomogeneous phase arising in cold dense QCD in a magnetic field. Following a recent study that demonstrated the absence of the Landau-Peierls (LP) instability from this phase, we calculate the (threshold) temperature at which the phonon fluctuations wash out the long-range order over a range of magnetic fields and densities relevant to astrophysical applications. Using a high-order Ginzburg-Landau expansion, we find that the threshold temperature is very near the critical temperature for fields of order $10^{18}$ G, and still a sizable fraction of the critical temperature for fields of order $10^{17}$ G. Therefore, at sufficiently large magnetic fields, the long-range order of the MDCDW phase is preserved over most of the parameter space where it is energetically favored; at smaller magnetic fields, the long-range order is still preserved over a considerable region of parameter space relevant to compact stars. We provide general symmetry arguments to explain why a magnetic field alone is not enough to eliminate the LP instability that characterizes single-modulated phases in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Impact of choices for center-of-mass correction energy on the surface energy of Skyrme energy density functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of nuclear energy density functional (EDF) methods, many nuclear phenomena can be related to the deformation of intrinsic states. Their accurate modeling relies on the correct description of the change of nuclear binding energy with deformation. The two most important contributions to the deformation energy have their origin in shell effects and the surface energy coefficient of nuclear matter.
  In a first step, we build nine series of parametrizations with a systematically varied surface-energy coefficient a_surf for three frequently-used options for the CM correction (none, one-body term only, full one-body and two-body contributions) combined with three values for the isoscalar effective mass m^*_0/m (0.7, 0.8, 0.85) and analyse how well each of these parametrizations can be adjusted to the properties of spherical nuclei and infinite nuclear matter. In a second step, we performed additional fits without the constraint on surface energy, adding one ``best-fit" parametrization to each of the nine series. We then benchmark these parametrizations to the deformation properties of heavy nuclei by means of three-dimensional Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations that allow for non-axial and/or non-reflection symmetric configurations.
  We perform a detailed correlation analysis between surface and volume properties of nuclear matter using the nine series of parametrizations. The best fits out of each series are then benchmarked on the fission barriers of Pu240 and Hg180, as well as on the properties of deformed states at normal and superdeformation for actinides and nuclei in the neutron-deficient Hg region.

      <title>Which first order phase transitions to quark matter are possible in neutron stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine which first order phase transitions are consistent with today's astrophysical constraints. In particular, we explore how a well-constrained mass-radius data point would restrict the admissible parameter space and to this end, we employ the most likely candidates of the recent NICER limits of PSR J0030+0451. To systematically vary the stiffness of the equation of state, we employ a parameterizable relativistic mean field equation of state, which is in compliance with results from chiral effective field theory. We model phase transitions via Maxwell constructions and parameterize them by means of the transitional pressure $p_{\rm trans}$ and the jump in energy density $\Delta\epsilon$. This provides us with a generic setup that allows for rather general conclusions to be drawn. We outline some regions in the $p_{\rm trans}$-$\Delta\epsilon$ parameter space that may allow for a phase transition identification in the near future. We also find that a strongly constrained data point, at either exceptionally large or small radii, would reduce the parameter space to such an extent that mass and radius become insufficient indicators of a phase transition.</description>

      <title>Frame transformation and stable-causal hydrodynamic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing hydrodynamic formalisms, which in order to be causal and stable, (i) either requires to promote the `non-fluid' variables as the new degrees of freedom apart from the velocity and temperature, or (ii) needs to be in a general hydrodynamic frame other than the ones given by Landau and Eckart. We have rewritten the BDNK stress tensor (originally in the general frame) into the Landau frame by redefining the fluid variables such as velocity ($u^{\mu}$) and temperature ($T$) via a hydrodynamic frame transformation. This `fluid frame' transformation includes shift variables $\delta u^{\mu}$ and $\delta T$, which are small enough to be treated linearly but encompass all orders of gradient corrections. The redefinition indicates that though the BDNK formalism has a finite number of derivatives, in the Landau frame, it will either have an infinite number of derivatives or one has to resum them by introducing new `non-fluid' variables much like the MIS theory. The infinite derivative series are summed in two different ways that lead to two different methods of `integrating in' new `non-fluid' variables, showing the non-uniqueness of the process of `integrating in' new variables. Finally, the dispersion relations and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity and shear viscosity of a pion gas in a thermo-magnetic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the electrical conductivity and shear viscosity of a interacting pion gas in a thermo-magnetic medium using the kinetic theory. The collision term of the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in presence of background magnetic field is solved using the relaxation time approximation. The medium modified relaxation time is obtained from the corresponding in-medium $\pi\pi\rightarrow \pi\pi$ scattering cross-section calculated using the thermo-magnetic $\rho$ propagator. It is observed that the average relaxation time shows a $1/T^4$ variation with temperature for a fixed value of magnetic field. The relaxation time shows a mild oscillatory variation with respect to the magnetic field. It is also observed that the medium dependent scattering cross-section causes a considerable amount of influence on the electrical conductivity and shear viscosity compared to its vacuum counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the coupling between fermion spin and background electromagnetic fields using form factors. We show that the vacuum form factors at tree level reproduce the spin polarization effects found in chiral kinetic theory. The vacuum form factors corresponding to spin couplings to perpendicular electric field, parallel and perpendicular magnetic field are degenerate. The degeneracy is expected to be lifted in medium. As an example, we calculate the in-medium QCD radiative correction to the form factors at one-loop order, where we find partial lift of the degeneracy: the spin couplings to parallel and perpendicular magnetic field are different, but the spin couplings to perpendicular electric and parallel magnetic field remain the same.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Generalized Parton Distributions Through Lorentz Symmetry and Partial DGLAP Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relying on the polynomiality property of generalized parton distributions, which roots on Lorentz covariance, we prove that it is enough to know them at vanishing- and low-skewness within the DGLAP region to obtain a unique extension to their entire support up to a D-term. We put this idea in practice using two methods: Reconstruction using artificial neural networks and finite-elements methods. We benchmark our results against standard models for generalized parton distributions. In agreement with the formal expectation, we obtain a very accurate reconstructions for a maximal value of the skewness as low as 20% of the longitudinal momentum fraction. This result might be relevant for reconstruction of generalized parton distribution from experimental and lattice QCD data, where computations are for now, restricted in skewness.</description>

      <title>Role of Coulomb interaction in elastic pion-proton scattering from holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential cross sections of the elastic pion-proton scattering are investigated at very small momentum transfer in a holographic QCD model, considering both the strong and Coulomb interaction in the Regge regime. The strong interaction is described by the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, and the Coulomb interaction is characterized by the one photon exchange. The two interactions are linked through an interference term and we only need to determine a single adjustable parameter involved in this term. As to the parameters for the strong interaction, we can utilize the values determined in the previous studies. The differential cross sections can be predicted without any additional parameters, and it is shown that our predictions are consistent with the experimental data. We explicitly show the momentum transfer dependence for the interference effect. The energy dependence of the contribution ratios for each component is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Knudsen number, elliptic flow, specific heat at constant pressure, specific heat at constant volume, trace anomaly, thermal diffusion constant and isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Mixed Species Charge and Baryon Balance Functions Studies with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed species charge and baryon balance functions are computed based on proton--proton (pp) collisions simulated with the PYTHIA8 model. Simulations are performed with selected values of the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the Monash tune and the Ropes and Shoving modes of PYTHIA8 to explore whether such measurements provide useful new information and constraints on mechanisms of particle production in pp collisions. Charge balance functions are studied based on mixed pairs of pions, kaons, and protons, whereas baryon balance functions are computed for mixed low mass strange and non-strange baryons. Both charge and baryon balance functions of mixed particle pairs feature shapes and amplitudes that sensitively depend on the particle considered owing largely to the particle production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA. The evolution of balance functions integrals with the longitudinal width of the acceptance are presented and one finds that sums of such integrals for a given reference particle obey expected sum rules for both charge and baryon balance functions. Additionally, both types of balance functions are found to evolve in shape and amplitude with increasing collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the PYTHIA tunes considered.</description>
