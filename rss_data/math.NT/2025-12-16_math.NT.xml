      <title>Irregular Stanley sequences plausibly do not have growth $\Theta(n^2/\log n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stanley sequences starting from the set $\{0, n\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer have long been conjectured to be divided into two types: the "regular" type where the growth rate is $\Theta(n^{\log_2(3)})$, and the "irregular" type where the growth rate is thought to be $\Theta(n^2/\log n)$. A paradigmatic case of a candidate irregular type is $n=4$, although to date no value of $n$ has been proven to have such a growth rate. Here, we provide strong numerical evidence against this conjectured growth rate for $n=4$. Specifically, for $n=4$, it seems plausible that the upper bound is $O(n^2/\log n)$ but that the lower bound is in fact $\Omega(n^{2-\delta})$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$. This appears to be because the sequence is not totally "random" as has been assumed. Limitations of the numerical method here is discussed.</description>

      <title>Isolated points on modular curves of prime-power level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolated point on an algebraic curve is a closed point not belonging to a collection of points of the same degree parametrized by $\mathbf{P}^1$ or a positive rank abelian subvariety of the curve's Jacobian. We study the sets of $j$-invariants, in extensions of bounded degree, that arise as the $j$-invariant of an isolated point on a modular curve. We obtain finiteness results on these sets for families of modular curves with prime-power level. This is related to recent work of Bourdon and Ejder, who classified rational $j$-invariants of isolated points on the families $X_1(n)$ and $X_0(n)$, for $n$ a prime power.</description>

      <title>Expository notes on Spectral Reciprocity with Explicit Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assemble three basic analytic inputs -- the Kuznetsov trace formula on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ with explicit continuous spectrum, the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ Voronoi formula, and $t$-aspect second-moment bounds for $L(1/2+it,\varphi)$ -- into a single framework for a smoothed $\mathrm{GL}_3$ spectral average. For a fixed Hecke-Maass cusp form $\varphi$ on $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)$, we evaluate a weight-$0$ spectral average of $L(1/2,\varphi\times f_j)$ over the $\mathrm{GL}_2$ Maass spectrum. In the Kuznetsov normalization where the diagonal transform has density $t\tanh(\pi t)$, the diagonal contributes exactly $2\mathcal H_0[h]$; the off-diagonal and the continuous spectrum are bounded with power savings consistent with the currently best unconditional second-moment bounds in the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ $t$-aspect. The argument is organized into a sequence of steps: normalizations and approximate functional equations, insertion into Kuznetsov, Voronoi summation on $\mathrm{GL}_3$, a bilinear estimate for the off-diagonal, evaluation of the diagonal and the Eisenstein contribution, moment refinements and parameter optimization, and finally plateau-smooth spectral windows and standard generalizations.</description>

      <title>Hodge filtration and crystalline representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, $n$ an integer $\geq 2$ and $\rho$ an $n$-dimensional automorphic $p$-adic Galois representation (for a compact unitary group) such that $r:=\rho\vert_{\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}_p}/\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ is crystalline. Under a mild assumption on the Frobenius eigenvalues of $D:=D_{\mathrm{cris}}(r)$ and under the usual Taylor-Wiles conditions, we show that the locally analytic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ associated to $\rho$ in the corresponding Hecke eigenspace of the completed $H^0$ contains an explicit finite length subrepresentation which determines and only depends on $r$. This generalizes previous results of the second author which assumed that the Hodge filtration on $D$ was as generic as possible. Our approach provides a much more explicit link to this Hodge filtration (in all cases), which allows to study the internal structure of this finite length locally analytic subrepresentation.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic incomplete Mellin transforms and $p$-adic incomplete gamma-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $r$ be a non-zero rational number. In \cite{o'desky-richman:incomplete-gamma}, a construction was given of a $p$-adic incomplete gamma-function $\Gamma_p(\cdot,r)$ for each prime $p$ for which $|r - 1|_p &lt; 1$. Except in the special case where $r = 1$, only finitely many primes satisfy that condition for a given $r$. In the present paper, we give a construction that works under the much weaker condition that $|r|_p = 1$ using a $p$-adic integral transform we introduced in \cite{buckingham:factorial}. For any given $r$, this weaker condition holds for all except finitely many primes $p$.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Euler-Seidel Matrix Method and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a degenerate version of the Euler-Seidel matrix method by incorporating a parameter lambda into the classical recurrence relation. The standard Euler-Seidel method relates the generating functions of an initial sequence and its final sequence via Seidel's formula, Our generalized method establishes transformation formulas using lambda-generalized binomial identities and yields a degenerate Seidel's formula for the exponential generating functions. The results are applied to study and derive new combinatorial identities for sequences like the degenerate Bell and Fubini numbers and polynomials.</description>

      <title>Problems Regarding a Pair of Diophantine Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two relatively prime positive integers $a, b\in \mathbb{N}$, it is known that exactly one of the two Diophantine equations $$ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}\ \mbox{ and }\ 1 + ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}$$ has a nonnegative integral solution $(x, y)$. Furthermore, the solution is unique. In this note, we summarize recent results and some new ones on the solution of the two equations and provide an overview of problems for future investigation, some of which were presented at the 2025 International Conference on Class Groups of Number Fields and Related Topics.</description>

      <title>The leading constant in Malle's conjecture over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the analogue of Malle's conjecture for the global function field $\F_q(t)$ with $q$ sufficiently large, including a precise formula for the leading constant. The main ingredients are the recent breakthrough of Landesman--Levy on the stable homology of Hurwitz spaces, a novel interpretation of the Frobenius fixed components of Hurwitz spaces in terms of the Brauer group of the stack $BG$ and an interpretation of the number of $\F_q$ points of configuration spaces as a certain Tamagawa volume.</description>

      <title>Further Extensions of Sury's Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation commonly known as Sury's identity is a deceptively simple summation formula that connects the Lucas numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and powers of two. Many authors have given extensions and generalizations over the years; in this paper, we take a different approach that allows us to produce a good number of new summation formulas, all from elementary (but non-trivial) methods.</description>

      <title>Multiple Legendre polynomials in Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of multiple Legendre polynomials and prove that they satisfy an Ap\'ery-like recurrence. We give new upper bounds of the approximation measures of logarithms of rational numbers by algebraic numbers of bounded degree. We prove e.g. that the nonquadraticity exponent of $\log 2$ is bounded from above by $12.841618...$, thus improving upon a recent result of the author. Our construction also yields some other known results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present methods to compute Selmer groups associated to mod p Galois representations rho over a number field K, with a particular focus on comparing their ranks with periods coming from cohomology classes associated to rho by Serre's conjecture. This provides evidence for a loose version of a "mod p Bloch-Kato conjecture", where the vanishing of a period is predicted to capture the presence of rank in a Selmer group. Our methods are explicit, and implemented in Magma.</description>

      <title>On a generating function of Niebur-Poincar\'e series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\subset PSL_2(\mathbb{R})$ be a Fuchsian group of the first kind which has a cusp $i\infty$ of width one. In this paper, we first consider a generating function formed with the Niebur--Poincar\'e series $\{F_{m,s}(\tau)\}_{m\ge 1}$ associated to $i\infty$. We prove a relation between the continuation of this generating function to $s=1$ with the resolvent kernel associated to the hyperbolic Laplacian and the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series associated to $i\infty$, also at $s=1$. Secondly, we show that, for any $s\in \mathbb{N}$, the generating function equals Poincar\'e type series involving polylogarithms. We also consider a generating function formed with derivatives in $s$ of the Niebur--Poincar\'e series and prove that the continuation of the generating function at $s=1$ can be expressed in terms of $\Gamma$-periodization of a point-pair invariant involving the Rogers dilogarithm and the Kronecker limit function associated to the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series.</description>

      <title>Numeration systems without a dominant root and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional numeration systems are a large family of numeration systems used to represent natural numbers. Whether the set of all representations forms a regular language or not is one of the most important questions that can be asked of such a system. This question was investigated in a 1998 article by Hollander. Central to his analysis is a property linking positional numeration systems and R\'{e}nyi numeration systems, which use a real base to represent real numbers. However, this link only exists when the initial numeration system has a dominant root, which is not a necessary condition for regularity. In this article, we show a more general link between positional numeration systems and alternate base numeration systems, a family generalizing R\'{e}nyi systems. We then take advantage of this link to provide a full characterization of those numeration systems that generate a regular language. We also discuss the effectiveness of our method, and comment Hollander's results and conjecture in the light of ours.</description>

      <title>Open Homomorphisms between $m$-step Solvable Galois Groups Compatible with the Cyclotomic Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Ho3}, Hoshi proved that open homomorphisms between solvably closed Galois groups of number fields which are compatible with the cyclotomic characters arise from field embeddings. In this paper, we will prove an $m$-step solvable version of Hoshi's result. More precisely, if $K$ and $L$ are number fields, we will prove that given an open homomorphism between the maximal $m+3$-step solvable Galois groups of $K$ and $L$, where $m \geq 2$, and the induced open homomorphism between the corresponding maximal $m$-step solvable Galois groups, then the latter arises from a field embedding if and only if the open homomorphism between the $m+3$-step solvable (and hence also the $m$-step solvable) Galois groups is compatible with the cyclotomic characters of $K$ and $L$.</description>

      <title>Poisson--Dirichlet approximation for counting integers with divisors in an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple inequality that compares the laws of two random variables taking values in a convex set of any normed vector space. By combining it with Arratia's coupling, recently refined by Koukoulopoulos and the author, we present a general strategy to reduce the problem of finding an asymptotic formula for the number of integers whose prime factorization falls into any given subset of $\ell^1(\mathbb R)$, to finding upper bounds for two key probabilities measuring proximity to the boundary of the subset in question.
  We apply this strategy to give an asymptotic formula for counting integers in $[1, x]$ that have a divisor in an interval $(y, z)$ with $z/y \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Jacobians of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a generalized Jacobian $\mathrm{J}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ and a generalized Picard group $\mathrm{P}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ of a graph $\mathit{Gr}$ with respect to a modulus $ \mathfrak{m}=\sum_{i=1}^s m_iw_i$ with $w_i$ vertices of $\mathit{Gr}$ and $m_i\geq 1$. These groups occur as the component groups of N\'{e}ron models of generalized Jacobians. We prove a universal mapping property for $\mathrm{J}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ and show that an Abel-Jacobi map in this context induces an isomorphism from $\mathrm{P}_\frak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ to $\mathrm{J}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$. We also reinterpret $\mathrm{P}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ in terms of sheaves on the geometric realization $\left| \mathit{Gr}\right|$ of $\mathit{Gr}$, making a connection with tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>On Glaisher's Partition Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12346v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glaisher's theorem states that the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which repeat at most $m-1$ times is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which are not divisible by $m$. The $m=2$ case is Euler's famous partition theorem. Recently, Andrews, Kumar, and Yee gave two new partition functions $C(n)$ and $D(n)$ related to Euler's theorem. Lin and Zhang extended their result to Glaisher's theorem by generalizing $C(n)$. We generalize $D(n)$, prove an analogous partition identity for the $m=3$ case, and show that the general case is an example of an almost partition identity. We also provide a new series equal to Glaisher's product both in the finite and infinite cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carlitz considered integer compositions in which adjacent parts must be unequal. Arndt recently initiated the study of restricted compositions based on conditions applied to certain pairs of parts rather than to individual parts. Here, we combine and generalize these notions, establishing enumeration results using both combinatorial proofs and generating functions. Motivations for our generalizations include the gap-free compositions studied by Hitczenko and Knopfmacher and the Rogers-Ramanujan integer partitions.</description>

      <title>A Conjecture on Almost Flat SIC-POVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well supported conjecture states that SIC-POVMs -- maximal sets of complex equiangular lines -- with anti-unitary symmetry give rise to an identity expressing some of its overlaps as squares of the (rescaled) components of a suitably chosen fiducial vector. In number theoretical terms the identity essentially expresses Stark units as sums of products of pairs of square roots of Stark units. We investigate whether the identity is enough to determine these Stark units. The answer is no, but the failure might be quite mild.</description>

      <title>The motivic Galois group for a double zeta value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multiple zeta values, which are periods of mixed Tate motives over $\mathbb Z$. For a given multiple zeta value $\zeta$, there exists a unique minimal motive $M(\zeta)$ such that $\zeta$ is a period of $M(\zeta)$. In general, the motive $M(\zeta)$ is difficult to compute. In this article, we compute the minimal motive $M(a,b)$ associated to a given double zeta value $\zeta(a,b)$. We also compute the motivic Galois group $G(a,b)$ associated to $\zeta(a,b)$ and discuss its dimension. Moreover, we give a period matrix of $M(a,b)$. The period conjecture predicts that the dimension of $G(a,b)$ equals the transcendence degree of the algebra of periods of $M(a,b)$. Hence our results lead to conjectures about algebraic relations between single and double zeta values.</description>

      <title>Signatures in TQFT : Asymptotics and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the signature $\sigma_g(\frac q p)$ of $\mathrm{SU}_2$-TQFT vector spaces associated to surfaces of genus $g$, as a function of the defining root of unity $\zeta=e^{i\pi q/p}$. We prove that $\frac{1}{p^2}\sigma_2(\frac{q}{p})$ converges to $\Lambda(\theta)=\frac{16}{\pi^3}\sum\limits_{n\ge 1, \textrm{ odd}}\frac{1}{n^3\sin(n\pi\theta)}$ when $\frac{q}{p}$ goes to an irrational number $\theta\in [0,1]$ under certain conditions. We also observe that the function $\Lambda(\theta)$ is the boundary value of an Eichler integral of a level $2$ modular form of weight $4$, and use this to propose a conjectural transformation law for the signature function in genus 2 similar to the reciprocity formula for classical Dedekind sums.</description>

      <title>On the centralizers of endomorphisms of the projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a dominant endomorphism of the projective line, which is not conjugate to a power map $z\mapsto z^{\pm d}$. We consider the centralizers of the iterates of $f$, $C(f^{n}):=\{\textrm{dominant}\;g:\mathbb{P}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{1}\;|\; g\circ f^{n}=f^{n}\circ g\}$, $n\geq1$, and prove that their union is equal to $C(f^{N})$ for some $N\geq1$. This solves a conjecture of F. Pakovich. As an application, we obtain a Tits alternative for cancellative semigroups of endomorphisms of the projective line, without an assumption of finite generation, extending the results of J.P. Bell, K. Huang, W. Peng and T.J. Tucker.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integral models of meta-unitary Shimura varieties through the lens of Scholze's fiber product conjecture. Reformulating Bultel's original construction in terms of moduli stacks of Shtukas and Igusa stacks, we prove the validity of the fiber product formula for this class of non-abelian type Shimura varieties, thereby generalizing the works of Zhang and Daniels, Van Hoften, Kim, and Zhang. We utilize this geometric description to derive local-global compatibility results and, adapting the strategy of Zhu and Yang, apply the unipotent categorical local Langlands correspondence to prove a general vanishing theorem for the generic part of the cohomology of meta-unitary Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>When is a cut and project set substitutional?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cut and project sets are obtained by projecting an irrational slice through a lattice to a lower dimensional subspace. Under standard conditions, the resulting pattern has no translational periods even though it retains some regularity of the lattice. Cut and project sets are one of the archetypical examples of patterns featuring aperiodic order, the other construction methods being by substitution and matching rules. Many early examples of aperiodic tilings, including the famous Penrose and Ammann--Beenker tilings, have a description from all of these methods. In this article we answer the following question, in the case of a Euclidean total space: what property of the cut and project data characterises when the resulting cut and project sets may also be defined by a substitution rule?</description>

      <title>Stratification and averaging for exponential sums: bilinear forms with generalized Kloosterman sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.09849v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove non-trivial bounds for bilinear forms with hyper-Kloosterman sums with characters modulo a prime $q$ which, for both variables of length $M$, are non-trivial as soon as $M\geq q^{3/8+\delta}$ for any $\delta&gt;0$. This range, which matches Burgess's range, is identical with the best results previously known only for simpler exponentials of monomials. The proof combines refinements of the analytic tools from our previous paper and new geometric methods. The key geometric idea is a comparison statement that shows that even when the "sum-product" sheaves that appear in the analysis fail to be irreducible, their decomposition reflects that of the "input" sheaves, except for parameters in a high-codimension subset. This property is proved by a subtle interplay between \'etale cohomology in its algebraic and diophantine incarnations. We prove a first application concerning the first moment of a family of $L$-functions of degree $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic not equal to 2. In this paper, we prove the local converse theorem for quasi-split $\O_{2n}(F)$ and $\SO_{2n}(F)$, via the description of the local theta correspondence between $\O_{2n}(F)$ and $\Sp_{2n}(F)$. More precisely, as a main step, we explicitly describe the precise behavior of the $\gamma$-factors under the correspondence. Furthermore, we apply our results to prove the weak rigidity theorems for irreducible generic cuspidal automorphic representations of $\O_{2n}(\A)$ and $\SO_{2n}(\mathbb{A})$, respectively, where $\A$ is a ring of adele of a global number field $L$.</description>

The Ankeny-Artin-Chowla-Conjecture states that $p$ is not a divisor of $y$. In this note, we provide and discuss a counterexample to this conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the average shifted convolution sum $$ B(H,N):= \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h \sim H} \sum_{n \sim N} A_{\pi_1}(n)\, A_{\pi_2}(n+h), $$ where $A_{\pi_i}(n)$ denotes the Fourier coefficients of a Hecke--Maass cusp form $\pi_i$ for $\mathrm{SL}(d_i,\mathbb{Z})$ with $d_i\ge 4$, $i=1,2$. We establish a nontrivial power-saving bound of $B(H,N)$ for the range of the shift $H\ge N^{1-\frac{4}{d_1+d_2}+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. For the cases $d_1 = d_2 + 1$ and $d_1 = d_2$, our result extends a result that can be derived from a theorem of Friedlander and Iwaniec. In particular, when $d_1 = d_2$, we reach the critical threshold $H\ge N^{1-2/d+\varepsilon}$ such that any further improvement in this range yields a subconvexity bound for the corresponding standard $L$-function in the $t$-aspect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.11034v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flach and Morin constructed in (Doc. Math. 23 (2018), 1425--1560) Weil-\'etale cohomology $H^i_\text{W,c} (X, \mathbb{Z} (n))$ for a proper, regular arithmetic scheme $X$ (i.e. separated and of finite type over $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$) and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. In the case when $n &lt; 0$, we generalize their construction to an arbitrary arithmetic scheme $X$, thus removing the proper and regular assumption. The construction uses \'etale motivic cohomology groups $H^i(X_\text{\'et}, \mathbb{Z}^c(n))$, as studied by Geisser (Ann. of Math. (2) 172 (2010), 1095--1126), and assumes their finite generation for $n &lt; 0$. We give a class of X for which finite generation is known, and hence $H^i_\text{W,c} (X, \mathbb{Z} (n))$ is defined unconditionally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a collection of articles, written as sections, on arithmetic properties of differential equations, holomorphic foliations, Gauss-Manin connections and Hodge loci. Each section is independent from the others and it has its own abstract and introduction and the reader might get an insight to the text by reading the introduction of each section. The main connection between them is through comments in footnotes. Our major aim is to develop a theory of leaf schemes over finitely generated subrings of complex numbers, such that the leaves are also equipped with a scheme structure. We also aim to formulate a local-global conjecture for leaf schemes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a $p$-adic path integral via $p$-adic multiple integrals. This integral describes the evolution of a wave function $\Psi(x)$, which is defined as a map from a domain in $\mathbb{C}_{p}$ to $\mathbb{C}_{p}$. We also compute the Feynman propagator for free particles, demonstrating that the result obtained is similar to the classical counterparts.</description>
