      <title>Interpolation in Proof Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of proof-theoretic methods for establishing interpolation properties across a range of logics, including classical, intuitionistic, modal, and substructural logics. Central to the discussion are two foundational techniques: Maehara's method for Craig interpolation and Pitts' method for uniform interpolation. The chapter demonstrates how these methods lead to results on the existence of well-behaved proof systems in the contemporary framework of universal proof theory and how they provide a road map for constructing interpolation proofs using modern proof formalisms. The emphasis of the chapter is on constructive, modular, and syntax-driven techniques that illuminate deeper connections between interpolation properties and proof systems.</description>

      <title>Case Study: Saturations as Explicit Models in Equational Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated theorem provers (ATPs) can disprove conjectures by saturating a set of clauses, but the resulting saturated sets are opaque certificates. In the unit equational fragment, a saturated set can in fact be read as a convergent rewrite system defining an explicit, possibly infinite, model -- but this is not widely known, even amongst frequent users of ATPs. Moreover, ATPs do not emit these explicit certificates for infinite (counter-)models. We present such a certificate construction in full, implement it in Vampire and E, and apply it to the recent Equational Theories Project, where hundreds of implications do not admit finite countermodels. The resulting rewrite systems can be checked for confluence and termination by existing certified tools, yielding trustworthy countermodels.</description>

      <title>Inductive Satisfiability Certification for Universal Quantifiers and Uninterpreted Function Symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of uninterpreted function symbols and universal quantification occurs in many applications of automated reasoning, for example, due to their ability to reason about arrays. Yet the satisfiability of such formulas is, in general, undecidable. In practice, SMT solvers are often successful in the unsatisfiable case, using heuristics. However, in the satisfiable case, they rely on explicit model construction, which fails for formulas whose smallest model is not small enough. We introduce an alternative approach that certifies satisfiability using induction arguments, and apply it to the case of linear integer arithmetic. The resulting algorithm is able to prove satisfiability of formulas that are out of reach for current SMT solvers.</description>

      <title>Reintroducing the Second Player in EPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem of sub-fragments of the Bernays-Schoenfinkel class of first-order logic, also known as EPR (Effectively Propositional). While Bernays-Schoenfinkel is NEXPTIME-complete, we already can obtain fragments that are PSPACE-complete by restricting our clauses to DET-HORN or KROM. However such restrictions yield very different formulas to the canonical PSPACE-complete language of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). This is despite Bernays-Schoenfinkel having a natural connection to an extension of QBF known as Dependency QBF. Our main contribution is the definition of a PSPACE-complete sub-fragment of Bernays-Schoenfinkel that extends from a translation of QBF, retains a similar two-player game evaluation for its semantics and can be restricted in various ways to obtain other complete problems, particularly those at different levels in the polynomial hierarchy. We use this definition to identify problems in the TPTP library that fall into this fragment and their level in the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Pitts and Intuitionistic Multi-Succedent: Uniform Interpolation for KM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pitts' proof-theoretic technique for uniform interpolation, which generates uniform interpolants from terminating sequent calculi, has only been applied to logics on an intuitionistic basis through single-succedent sequent calculi. We adapt the technique to the intuitionistic multi-succedent setting by focusing on the intuitionistic modal logic KM. To do this, we design a novel multi-succedent sequent calculus for this logic which terminates, eliminates cut, and provides a decidability argument for KM. Then, we adapt Pitts' technique to our calculus to construct uniform interpolants for KM, while highlighting the hurdles we overcame. Finally, by (re)proving the algebraisability of KM, we deduce the coherence of the class of KM-algebras. All our results are fully mechanised in the Rocq proof assistant, ensuring correctness and enabling effective computation of interpolants.</description>

      <title>Disproving (Positive) Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Term Rewriting via Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous techniques were developed to automatically prove termination of different kinds of probabilistic programs. However, there are only few automated methods to disprove their termination. In this paper, we present the first techniques to automatically disprove (positive) almost-sure termination of probabilistic term rewrite systems. Disproving termination of non-probabilistic systems requires finding a finite representation of an infinite computation, e.g., a loop of the rewrite system. We extend such qualitative techniques to probabilistic term rewriting, where a quantitative analysis is required. In addition to the existence of a loop, we have to count the number of such loops in order to embed suitable random walks into a computation, thereby disproving termination. To evaluate their power, we implemented all our techniques in the tool AProVE.</description>

      <title>MerLean: An Agentic Framework for Autoformalization in Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MerLean, a fully automated agentic framework for autoformalization in quantum computation. MerLean extracts mathematical statements from \LaTeX{} source files, formalizes them into verified Lean~4 code built on Mathlib, and translates the result back into human-readable \LaTeX{} for semantic review. We evaluate MerLean on three theoretical quantum computing papers producing 2,050 Lean declarations from 114 statements in total. MerLean achieves end-to-end formalization on all three papers, reducing the verification burden to only the newly introduced definitions and axioms. Our results demonstrate that agentic autoformalization can scale to frontier research, offering both a practical tool for machine-verified peer review and a scalable engine for mining high-quality synthetic data to train future reasoning models. Our approach can also be generalized to any other rigorous research in mathematics and theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Causal and Compositional Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstracting from a low level to a more explanatory high level of description, and ideally while preserving causal structure, is fundamental to scientific practice, to causal inference problems, and to robust, efficient and interpretable AI. We present a general account of abstractions between low and high level models as natural transformations, focusing on the case of causal models. This provides a new formalisation of causal abstraction, unifying several notions in the literature, including constructive causal abstraction, Q-$\tau$ consistency, abstractions based on interchange interventions, and `distributed' causal abstractions. Our approach is formalised in terms of category theory, and uses the general notion of a compositional model with a given set of queries and semantics in a monoidal, cd- or Markov category; causal models and their queries such as interventions being special cases. We identify two basic notions of abstraction: downward abstractions mapping queries from high to low level; and upward abstractions, mapping concrete queries such as Do-interventions from low to high. Although usually presented as the latter, we show how common causal abstractions may, more fundamentally, be understood in terms of the former. Our approach also leads us to consider a new stronger notion of `component-level' abstraction, applying to the individual components of a model. In particular, this yields a novel, strengthened form of constructive causal abstraction at the mechanism-level, for which we prove characterisation results. Finally, we show that abstraction can be generalised to further compositional models, including those with a quantum semantics implemented by quantum circuits, and we take first steps in exploring abstractions between quantum compositional circuit models and high-level classical causal models as a means to explainable quantum AI.</description>

      <title>ScenicRules: An Autonomous Driving Benchmark with Multi-Objective Specifications and Abstract Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing autonomous driving systems for complex traffic environments requires balancing multiple objectives, such as avoiding collisions, obeying traffic rules, and making efficient progress. In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives. Our benchmark can be accessed at https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/ScenicRules/.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Verification of Transformer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: C-RASP is a simple programming language that was recently shown to capture concepts expressible by transformers. In this paper, we develop new algorithmic techniques for automatically verifying C-RASPs. To this end, we establish a connection to the verification of synchronous dataflow programs in Lustre, which enables us to exploit state-of-the-art model checkers utilizing highly optimized SMT-solvers. Our second contribution addresses learning a C-RASP program in the first place. To this end, we provide a new algorithm for learning a C-RASP from examples using local search. We demonstrate efficacy of our implementation for benchmarks of C-RASPs in the literature, in particular in connection to the following applications: (1) transformer program optimization, and (2) constrained learning of transformer programs (based on a partial specification).</description>

      <title>A type theory for invertibility in weak $\omega$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a conservative extension ICaTT of the dependent type theory CaTT for weak $\omega$-categories with a type witnessing coinductive invertibility of cells. This extension allows for a concise description of the "walking equivalence" as a context, and of a set of maps characterising $\omega$-equifibrations as substitutions. We provide an implementation of our theory, which we use to formalise basic properties of invertible cells. These properties allow us to give semantics of ICaTT in marked weak $\omega$-categories, building a fibrant marked $\omega$-category out of every model of ICaTT.</description>

      <title>Bounded Model Checking for Unbounded Client Server Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bounded model checking (BMC) is an efficient formal verification technique which allows for desired properties of a software system to be checked on bounded runs of an abstract model of the system. The properties are frequently described in some temporal logic and the system is modeled as a state transition system. In this paper we propose a novel counting logic, $\mathcal{L}_{C}$, to describe the temporal properties of client-server systems with an unbounded number of clients. We also propose two dimensional bounded model checking ($2D$-BMC) strategy that uses two distinguishable parameters, one for execution steps and another for the number of tokens in the net representing a client-server system, and these two evolve separately, which is different from the standard BMC techniques in the Petri Nets formalism. This $2D$-BMC strategy is implemented in a tool called DCModelChecker which leverages the $2D$-BMC technique with a state-of-the-art satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver Z3. The system is given as a Petri Net and properties specified using $\mathcal{L}_{C}$ are encoded into formulas that are checked by the solver. Our tool can also work on industrial benchmarks from the Model Checking Contest (MCC). We report on these experiments to illustrate the applicability of the $2D$-BMC strategy.</description>

Abstract: Reachability in pushdown vector addition systems with states (PVASS) is among the longest standing open problems in Theoretical Computer Science. We show that the problem is decidable in full generality. Our decision procedure is similar in spirit to the KLMST algorithm for VASS reachability, but works over objects that support an elaborate form of procedure summarization as known from pushdown reachability.</description>

      <title>Expressive Power of Graph Transformers via Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers are the basis of modern large language models, but relatively little is known about their precise expressive power on graphs. We study the expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO), GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for floats).</description>
