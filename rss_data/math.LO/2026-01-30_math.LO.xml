      <title>Measuring the Complexity of Countable Presburger Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take two approaches to classifying the complexity of Presburger models: Scott analysis and degree spectra. In particular, we investigate the possible Scott sentence complexities and possible degree spectra of models of Presburger arithmetic. Many of our results will be achieved by showing how given a linear order $\mathcal{L}$, we can construct a Presburger group $P_\mathcal{L}$ that maintains much of the structure of $\mathcal{L}$.</description>

      <title>A categorical equivalence for monadic algebras of first-order substructural logics motivated by Kalman's construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The category $\mathbb{DRDL'}$, whose objects are c-differential residuated distributive lattices that satisfy the condition $\mathbf{CK}$, is the image of the category $\mathbb{RDL}$, whose objects are residuated distributive lattices, under the categorical equivalence (Kalman functor) $\mathbf{K}$. The main goal of this paper is to lift this equivalence $\mathbf{K}$ to the category $\mathbb{MRDL}$, whose objects are monadic residuated distributive lattices, and the category $\mathbb{MDRDL'}$, whose objects are pairs formed by an object of $\mathbb{DRDL'}$ and a center universal quantifier. Firstly, based on the variety of monadic FL$_\textrm{e}$-algebras, we introduce the concept of monadic residuated lattices and study some of their further algebraic properties, proving the classes of monadic residuated distributive lattices and monadic c-differential residuated distributive lattices are in one-to-one correspondence. Subsequently, based on this corresponding relation, we prove that there exists a categorical equivalence between the categories $\mathbb{MRDL}$ and $\mathbb{MDRDL'}$. The results of this paper not only generalizes the works of Sagastume and San Mart\'{i}n in [Mathematical Logic Quarterly, {\bf 60}(2014), 375--388], but also addresses and overcomes the limitations identified in the works of [Studia Logica, {\bf 111}(2023), 361--390]. Finally, this paper concludes with some applications regarding descriptions of a 2-contextual translation.</description>

      <title>The Leibniz adjunction in homotopy type theory, with an application to simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory and equips types with a notion of directed morphisms. A Segal type is defined to be a type in which these directed morphisms can be composed. We show that all higher coherences can be stated and derived if simplicial type theory is taken to be homotopy type theory with a postulated interval type. In technical terms, this means that if a type has unique fillers for $(2,1)$-horns, it has unique fillers for all inner $(n,k)$-horns. This generalizes a result of Riehl and Shulman for the case $n = 3, k \in \{1, 2\}$. Our main technical tool is the Leibniz adjunction: the pushout-product is left adjoint to the pullback-hom in the wild category of types. While this adjunction is well known for ordinary categories, it is much more involved for higher categories, and the fact that it can be proved for the wild category of types (a higher category without stated higher coherences) is non-trivial. We make profitable use of the equivalence between the wild category of maps and that of families. We have formalized the results in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Finite Borel Asymptotic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the set of locally finite Borel graphs with finite Borel asymptotic dimension is $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2$-complete. The result is based on a combinatorial characterization of finite Borel asymptotic dimension for graphs generated by a single Borel function. As an application of this characterization, we classify the complexities of digraph homomorphism problems for this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>On groups definable in geometric fields with generic derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study groups definable in existentially closed geometric fields with commuting derivations. Our main result is that such a group can be definably embedded in a group interpretable in the underlying geometric field. Compared to earlier work of the first two authors toguether with K. Peterzil, the novelty is that we also deal with infinite dimensional groups.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphisms of continua through projective Fra\"iss\'e limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homeomorphisms and the homeomorphism groups of compact metric spaces using the automorphism groups of projective Fra\"iss\'e limits. In our applications, we investigate the Polish group ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ of all homeomorphisms of the pseudoarc $P$ using the automorphism group ${\rm Aut}(\mathbb{P})$ of the pre-pseudoarc $\mathbb{P}$. Strengthening results from the literature, we show that the diagonal conjugacy action of ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ on ${\rm Homeo}(P)^{\mathbb{N}}$ has a dense orbit. In our second application, we show that there exists a homeomorphism of $P$ that is not conjugate in ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ to an element of ${\rm Aut}(\mathbb{P})$.</description>

      <title>Goldstern's Principle with respect to Hausdorff Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of the paper [Got25] and studies Goldstern's principle, a principle about unions of continuum many null sets, further. The main result is that the Hausdorff measure version of Goldstern's principle for $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$ sets fails in $L$, despite the fact that the Lebesgue measure version is true. Moreover, we show that this version holds provided that the measurable cardinal exists. Other various results regarding Goldstern's principle are established.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff measure due to Davies and Rogers and its cardinal invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Davies and Rogers constructed a Hausdorff measure satisfying the following property: every Borel subset of the space has measure either $\infty$ or $0$. In this paper, we examine cardinal invariants of their measure.</description>
