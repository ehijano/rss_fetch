      <title>Error norm estimates for the block conjugate gradient algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the book [Meurant and Tichy, SIAM, 2024] we discussed the estimation of error norms in the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm for solving linear systems $Ax=b$ with a symmetric positive definite matrix $A$, where $b$ and $x$ are vectors. In this paper, we generalize the most important formulas for estimating the $A$-norm of the error to the block case. First, we discuss in detail the derivation of various variants of the block CG (BCG) algorithm from the block Lanczos algorithm. We then consider BCG and derive the related block Gauss and block Gauss-Radau quadrature rules. We show how to obtain lower and upper bounds on the $A$-norm of the error of each system, both in terms of the quantities computed in BCG and in terms of the underlying block Lanczos algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the behavior of the bounds in practical computations.</description>

      <title>Exponentially accurate spectral Monte Carlo method for linear PDEs and their error estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a spectral Monte Carlo iterative method (SMC) for solving linear Poisson and parabolic equations driven by $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process with $\alpha\in (0,2)$, which was initially proposed and developed by Gobet and Maire in their pioneering works (Monte Carlo Methods Appl 10(3-4), 275--285, 2004, and SIAM J Numer Anal 43(3), 1256--1275, 2005) for the case $\alpha=2$. The novel method effectively integrates multiple computational techniques, including the interpolation based on generalized Jacobi functions (GJFs), space-time spectral methods, control variates techniques, and a novel walk-on-sphere method (WOS). The exponential convergence of the error bounds is rigorously established through finite iterations for both Poisson and parabolic equations involving the integral fractional Laplacian operator. Remarkably, the proposed space-time spectral Monte Carlo method (ST-SMC) for the parabolic equation is unified for both $\alpha\in(0,2)$ and $\alpha=2$. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the spectral accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, thereby validating the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Curvature Corrected Nonnegative Manifold Data Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data with underlying nonlinear structure are collected across numerous application domains, necessitating new data processing and analysis methods adapted to nonlinear domain structure. Riemannanian manifolds present a rich environment in which to develop such tools, as manifold-valued data arise in a variety of scientific settings, and Riemannian geometry provides a solid theoretical grounding for geometric data analysis. Low-rank approximations, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), are the foundation of many Euclidean data analysis methods, so adaptations of these factorizations for manifold-valued data are important building blocks for further development of manifold data analysis. In this work, we propose curvature corrected nonnegative manifold data factorization (CC-NMDF) as a geometry-aware method for extracting interpretable factors from manifold-valued data, analogous to nonnegative matrix factorization. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm for computing CC-NMDF and demonstrate our method on real-world diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging data.</description>

      <title>Effective Numerical Simulation of Fault Transient System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems, including synchronous generator systems, are typical systems that strive for stable operation. In this article, we numerically study the fault transient process of a synchronous generator system based on the first benchmark model. That is, we make it clear whether an originally stable generator system can restore its stability after a short time of unstable transient process. To achieve this, we construct a structure-preserving method and compare it with the existing and frequently-used predictor-corrector method. We newly establish a reductive form of the circuit system and accelerate the reduction process. Also a switching method between two stages in the fault transient process is given. Numerical results show the effectiveness and reliability of our method.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence analysis of fully discrete SAVs-FEM for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a fully discrete numerical scheme that is linear, decoupled, and unconditionally energy stable, and analyze its optimal error estimates for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. For time discretization, we employ the two scalar auxiliary variables (SAVs) and the pressure-correction projection method. For spatial discretization, we choose the $P_r \times P_r \times \mathbf{P}_{r+1} \times P_r$ finite element spaces, where $r$ is the degree of the local polynomials, and derive the optimal $L^2$ error estimates for the phase-field variable, chemical potential, and pressure in the case of $r \geq 1$, and for the velocity when $r \geq 2$, without relying on the quasi-projection operator technique proposed in \textit{[Cai et al. SIAM J Numer Anal, 2023]}. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, confirming the unconditional energy stability and optimal convergence rates of the proposed scheme. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the optimal $L^2$ convergence rate for the velocity when $r=1$.</description>

      <title>A Reynolds-semi-robust method with hybrid velocity and pressure for the unsteady incompressible Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and analyze a new Finite Element method for the solution of the two- and three-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations based on a hybrid discretization of both the velocity and pressure variables. The proposed method is pressure-robust, i.e., irrotational forcing terms do not affect the approximation of the velocity, and Reynolds-quasi-robust, with error estimates that, for smooth enough exact solutions, do not depend on the inverse of the viscosity. We carry out an in-depth convergence analysis highlighting pre-asymptotic convergence rates and validate the theoretical findings with a complete set of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Functional equation arising in behavioral sciences: solvability and collocation scheme in H\"older spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of a functional equation that models the learning process in various animal species. The equation can be considered nonlocal, as it is built with a convex combination of the unknown function evaluated at mixed arguments. This makes the equation contain two terms with vanishing delays. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution in the H\"older space which is a natural function space to consider. In the second part of the paper, we devise an efficient numerical collocation method used to find an approximation to the main problem. We prove the convergence of the scheme and, in passing, several properties of the linear interpolation operator acting on the H\"older space. Numerical simulations verify that the order of convergence of the method (measured in the supremum norm) is equal to the order of H\"older continuity.</description>

      <title>High-order mass conserving, positivity plus energy-law preserving schemes and their error estimates for Keller-Segel equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis plays a significant role in numerous physiological processes. The Keller-Segel equation serves as a mathematical model for simulating the phenomenon of cell population aggregation under chemotaxis, possessing physical properties such as mass conservation, positivity of density, and energy dissipation. High-order linear and decoupled schemes for the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel chemotaxis model are proposed in this paper, which satisfy the three physical properties mentioned earlier. Firstly, by applying a logarithmic transformation, the Keller-Segel model is reformulated into its equivalent form that maintains the positivity of cell density regardless of the discrete scheme. Based on this equivalent system, we then propose high-order linear and decoupled numerical schemes using the backward differentiation formula (BDF). Furthermore, through the incorporation of a recovery technique and an energy-law preservation correction (EPC), we ensure that these schemes maintain mass conservation and preserve the original energy-law. Finally, we conduct a rigorous optimal error analysis for the numerical schemes under certain assumptions regarding the regularity of solutions, and some numerical experiments are also presented to demonstrate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit relaxed finite volume schemes for hyperbolic multi-scale systems of conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a new semi-implicit relaxation scheme for the simulation of multi-scale hyperbolic conservation laws based on a Jin-Xin relaxation approach is presented. It is based on the splitting of the flux function into two or more subsystems separating the different scales of the considered model whose stiff components are relaxed thus yielding a linear structure of the resulting relaxation model on the relaxation variables. This allows the construction of a linearly implicit numerical scheme, where convective processes are discretized explicitly. Thanks to this linearity, the discrete scheme can be reformulated in linear decoupled wave-type equations resulting in the same number of evolved variables as in the original system. To obtain a scale independent numerical diffusion, centred fluxes are applied on the implicitly treated terms, whereas classical upwind schemes are applied on the explicit parts. The numerical scheme is validated by applying it on the Toro &amp; V\'azquez-Cend\'on (2012) splitting of the Euler equations and the Fambri (2021) splitting of the ideal MHD equations where the flux is split in two, respectively three sub-systems. The performance of the numerical scheme is assessed running benchmark test-cases from the literature in one and two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Infectious Diseases: From SIR Models to Diffusion-Based Approaches and Numerical Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global living standards improve and medical technology advances, many infectious diseases have been effectively controlled. However, certain diseases, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, continue to pose significant threats to public health. This paper explores the evolution of infectious disease modeling, from early ordinary differential equation-based models like the SIR framework to more complex reaction-diffusion models that incorporate both temporal and spatial dynamics. The study highlights the importance of numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, implicit-explicit time-discretization techniques, and finite difference methods, in solving these models. By analyzing the development and application of these methods, this research underscores their critical role in predicting disease spread, informing public health strategies, and mitigating the impact of future pandemics.</description>

      <title>Random Source Iteration Method: Mitigating the Ray Effect in the Discrete Ordinates Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commonly used velocity discretization for simulating the radiative transport equation (RTE) is the discrete ordinates method (DOM). One of the long-standing drawbacks of DOM is the phenomenon known as the ray effect. Due to the high dimensionality of the RTE, DOM results in a large algebraic system to solve. The Source Iteration (SI) method is the most standard iterative method for solving this system. In this paper, by introducing randomness into the SI method, we propose a novel random source iteration (RSI) method that offers a new way to mitigate the ray effect without increasing the computational cost. We have rigorously proved that RSI is unbiased with respect to the SI method and that its variance is uniformly bounded across iteration steps; thus, the convergence order with respect to the number of samples is $1/2$. Furthermore, we prove that the RSI iteration process, as a Markov chain, is ergodic under mild assumptions. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the convergence of RSI and its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovery of a sparse signal from a nonlinear system arises in many practical applications including compressive sensing, image reconstruction and machine learning. In this paper, a fast block nonlinear Bregman-Kaczmarz method with averaging is presented for nonlinear sparse signal recovery problems. Theoretical analysis proves that the averaging block nonlinear Bregman-Kaczmarz method with both constant stepsizes and adaptive stepsizes are convergent. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the averaging block nonlinear Bregman-Kaczmarz method, which converges faster than the existing nonlinear Bregman-Kaczmarz methods.</description>

      <title>Modal analysis of a domain decomposition method for Maxwell's equations in a waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-harmonic wave propagation problems, especially those governed by Maxwell's equations, pose significant computational challenges due to the non-self-adjoint nature of the operators and the large, non-Hermitian linear systems resulting from discretization. Domain decomposition methods, particularly one-level Schwarz methods, offer a promising framework to tackle these challenges, with recent advancements showing the potential for weak scalability under certain conditions. In this paper, we analyze the weak scalability of one-level Schwarz methods for Maxwell's equations in strip-wise domain decompositions, focusing on waveguides with general cross sections and different types of transmission conditions such as impedance or perfectly matched layers (PMLs). By combining techniques from the limiting spectrum analysis of Toeplitz matrices and the modal decomposition of Maxwell's solutions, we provide a novel theoretical framework that extends previous work to more complex geometries and transmission conditions. Numerical experiments confirm that the limiting spectrum effectively predicts practical behavior even with a modest number of subdomains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the one-level Schwarz method can achieve robustness with respect to the wave number under specific domain decomposition parameters, offering new insights into its applicability for large-scale electromagnetic wave problems.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of frequency-localized functions from pointwise samples via least squares and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering frequency-localized functions from pointwise data is a fundamental task in signal processing. We examine this problem from an approximation-theoretic perspective, focusing on least squares and deep learning-based methods. First, we establish a novel recovery theorem for least squares approximations using the Slepian basis from uniform random samples in low dimensions, explicitly tracking the dependence of the bandwidth on the sampling complexity. Building on these results, we then present a recovery guarantee for approximating bandlimited functions via deep learning from pointwise data. This result, framed as a practical existence theorem, provides conditions on the network architecture, training procedure, and data acquisition sufficient for accurate approximation. To complement our theoretical findings, we perform numerical comparisons between least squares and deep learning for approximating one- and two-dimensional functions. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical limitations and the practical gaps between theory and implementation.</description>

      <title>A control-oriented approach to optimal sensor placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a control-oriented optimal experimental design (cOED) approach for linear PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems. In particular, we consider optimal control problems with uncertain parameters that need to be estimated by solving an inverse problem, which in turn requires measurement data. We consider the case where data is collected at a set of sensors. While classical Bayesian OED techniques provide experimental designs (sensor placements) that minimize the posterior uncertainty in the inversion parameter, these designs are not tailored to the demands of the optimal control problem. In the present control-oriented setting, we prioritize the designs that minimize the uncertainty in the state variable being controlled or the control objective. We propose a mathematical framework for uncertainty quantification and cOED for parameterized PDE-constrained optimal control problems with linear dependence to the control variable and the inversion parameter. We also present scalable computational methods for computing control-oriented sensor placements and for quantifying the uncertainty in the control objective. Additionally, we present illustrative numerical results in the context of a model problem motivated by heat transfer applications.</description>

      <title>Refined radial basis function-generated finite difference analysis of non-Newtonian natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a refined Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) solution for a non-Newtonian fluid in a closed differentially heated cavity. The non-Newtonian behaviour is modelled with the Ostwald-de Waele power law and the buoyancy with the Boussinesq approximation. The problem domain is discretised with scattered nodes without any requirement for a topological relation between them. This allows a trivial generalisation of the solution procedure to complex irregular three dimensional (3D) domains, which is also demonstrated by solving the problem in a two dimensional (2D) and 3D geometry mimicking a porous filter. The results in 2D are compared with two reference solutions that use the Finite volume method in a conjunction with two different stabilisation techniques, where we achieved good agreement with the reference data. The refinement is implemented on top of a dedicated meshless node positioning algorithm using piecewise linear node density function that ensures sufficient node density in the centre of the domain while maximising the node density in a boundary layer where the most intense dynamic is expected. The results show that with a refined approach, more than 5 times fewer nodes are required to obtain the results with the same accuracy compared to the regular discretisation. The paper also discusses the convergence with refined discretisation for different scenarios for up to $2 \cdot 10^5$ nodes, the impact of method parametres, the behaviour of the flow in the boundary layer, the behaviour of the viscosity and the geometric flexibility of the proposed solution procedure.</description>

      <title>Development of discontinuous Galerkin methods for hyperbolic systems that preserve a curl or a divergence constraint: the case of linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some hyperbolic systems are known to include implicit preservation   of differential constraints: these are for example the time conservation of the curl or the divergence of a vector that appear as an implicit constraint. In this article, we show that this kind of constraint can be easily conserved at the discrete level with the classical discontinuous Galerkin method, provided the right approximation space is used for the vectorial space, and under some mild assumption on the numerical flux. For this, we recall  a discrete de-Rham framework in which discontinuous  approximation spaces for vectors fits.  The discrete adjoint divergence and curl are proven to be exactly preserved by the discontinuous Galerkin method under a small assumption on the numerical flux. Numerical tests are performed on the wave system, the two dimensional Maxwell system and the induction equation, and confirm that the differential constraints  are  preserved at machine precision while keeping the high order of accuracy.</description>

      <title>High-order limiting methods using maximum principle bounds derived from the Boltzmann equation I: Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of limiting methods for high-order numerical approximations of hyperbolic conservation laws generally requires defining an admissible region/bounds for the solution. In this work, we present a novel approach for computing solution bounds and limiting for the Euler equations through the kinetic representation provided by the Boltzmann equation, which allows for extending limiters designed for linear advection directly to the Euler equations. Given an arbitrary set of solution values to compute bounds over (e.g., numerical stencil) and a desired linear advection limiter, the proposed approach yields an analytic expression for the admissible region of particle distribution function values, which may be numerically integrated to yield a set of bounds for the density, momentum, and total energy. These solution bounds are shown to preserve positivity of density/pressure/internal energy and, when paired with a limiting technique, can robustly resolve strong discontinuities while recovering high-order accuracy in smooth regions without any ad hoc corrections (e.g., relaxing the bounds). This approach is demonstrated in the context of an explicit unstructured high-order discontinuous Galerkin/flux reconstruction scheme for a variety of difficult problems in gas dynamics, including cases with extreme shocks and shock-vortex interactions. Furthermore, this work presents a foundation for limiting techniques for more complex macroscopic governing equations that can be derived from an underlying kinetic representation for which admissible solution bounds are not well-understood.</description>

      <title>A unified convergence analysis framework of the energy-stable ETDRK3 schemes for the No-slope-selection thin film model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a unified framework for the space-time convergence analysis of the energy-stable third-order accurate exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta schemes. By employing Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space and the inner product technique, we derive a rigorous Fourier eigenvalue analysis, which provides a detailed optimal convergence rate and error estimate. The primary challenge is addressing the complex nonlinear terms in the NSS equation. Fortunately, this challenge could be resolved through careful eigenvalue bound estimates for various operators.</description>

      <title>Tensorization of neural networks for improved privacy and interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the tensor train representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing tensor trains in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.</description>

      <title>A hybrid two-level weighted Schwartz method for time-harmonic Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the preconditioning technique for discrete systems arising from time-harmonic Maxwell equations with absorptions, where the discrete systems are generated by N\'ed\'elec finite element methods of fixed order on meshes with suitable size. This kind of preconditioner is defined as a two-level hybrid form, which falls into the class of ``unsymmetrically weighted'' Schwarz method based on the overlapping domain decomposition with impedance boundary subproblems. The coarse space in this preconditioner is constructed by specific eigenfunctions solving a series of generalized eigenvalue problems in the local discrete Maxwell-harmonic spaces according to a user-defined tolerance $\rho$. We establish a stability result for the considered discrete variational problem. Using this discrete stability, we prove that the two-level hybrid Schwarz preconditioner is robust in the sense that the convergence rate of GMRES is independent of the mesh size, the subdomain size and the wave-number when $\rho$ is chosen appropriately. We also define an economical variant that avoids solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and illustrate the efficiency of the preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Chernoff approximations as a method for finding the resolvent of a linear operator and solving a linear ODE with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chernoff approximation method is a powerful and flexible tool of functional analysis, which allows in many cases to express exp(tL) in terms of variable coefficients of a linear differential operator L. In this paper, we prove a theorem that allows us to apply this method to find the resolvent of L. Our theorem states that the Laplace transforms of Chernoff approximations of a $C_0$-semigroup converge to the resolvent of the generator of this semigroup. We demonstrate the proposed method on a second-order differential operator with variable coefficients. As a consequence, we obtain a new representation of the solution of a nonhomogeneous linear ordinary differential equation of the second order in terms of functions that are coefficients of this equation, playing the role of parameters of the problem. For the Chernoff function, based on the shift operator, we give an estimate for the rate of convergence of approximations to the solution.</description>

      <title>Deep Parallel Spectral Neural Operators for Solving Partial Differential Equations with Enhanced Low-Frequency Learning Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing universal artificial intelligence (AI) solver for partial differential equations (PDEs) is an open-ended problem and a significant challenge in science and engineering. Currently, data-driven solvers have achieved great success, such as neural operators. However, the ability of various neural operator solvers to learn low-frequency information still needs improvement. In this study, we propose a Deep Parallel Spectral Neural Operator (DPNO) to enhance the ability to learn low-frequency information. Our method enhances the neural operator's ability to learn low-frequency information through parallel modules. In addition, due to the presence of truncation coefficients, some high-frequency information is lost during the nonlinear learning process. We smooth this information through convolutional mappings, thereby reducing high-frequency errors. We selected several challenging partial differential equation datasets for experimentation, and DPNO performed exceptionally well. As a neural operator, DPNO also possesses the capability of resolution invariance.</description>
