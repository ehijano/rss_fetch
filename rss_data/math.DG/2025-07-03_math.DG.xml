      <title>Classification of spin$^c$ manifolds with generalized positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $M$ is a closed $n$-dimensional spin$^c$ manifold with spin$^c$ structure $\sigma$ and associated spin$^c$ line bundle $L$. If one fixes a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ and a connection $\nabla_L$ on $L$, the generalized scalar curvature $R^{\text{gen}}$ of $(M,L)$ is $R_g - 2|\Omega_L|_{\text{op}}$, where $|\Omega_L|_{\text{op}}$ is the pointwise operator norm of the curvature $2$-form $\Omega_L$ of $\nabla_L$, acting on spinors. In a previous paper, we showed that positivity of $R^{\text{gen}}$ is obstructed by the non-vanishing of the index of the spin$^c$ Dirac operator on $(M,g,L,\nabla_L)$, and that in some cases, the vanishing of this index guarantees the existence of a pair $(g,\nabla_L)$ with positive generalized scalar curvature. Building on this and on surgery techniques inspired by those that have been developed in the theory of positive scalar curvature on spin manifolds, we show that if $\dim M = n \ge 5$, if the fundamental group $\pi$ of $M$ is in a large class including surface groups and finite groups with periodic cohomology, and if $M$ is totally non-spin (meaning that the universal cover is not spin), then $(M,L)$ admits positive generalized scalar curvature if and only if the generalized $\alpha$-invariant of $(M,L)$ vanishes in the $K$-homology group $K_n(B\pi)$. We also develop an analogue of Stolz's sequence for computing the group of concordance classes of positive generalized scalar curvature metrics, and connect this to the analytic surgery sequence of Roe and Higson. Finally, we give a number of applications to moduli spaces of positive generalized scalar curvature metrics.</description>

      <title>Maximal stretch and Lipschitz maps on Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his seminal work on Teichm\"uller spaces (\cite{Th98}), Thurston introduced the maximal stretch for a pair of hyperbolic metrics on a closed surface of genus $\geq 2$ and showed that the logarithm of this quantity induces an asymmetric metric in the Teichm\"uller space. He also showed that the subset of the surface on which the maximal stretch is attained is a geodesic lamination. In this paper, we define the maximal stretch analogously for closed manifolds equipped with Riemannian metrics of variable negative curvature and investigate the structure of the related Mather set on the unit tangent bundle. In contrast to the Teichm\"uller space, the Mather set may not be lifts of geodesic laminations in this broader setting. However, in our paper, we will discuss similar features shared by the Mather set with geodesic laminations. We also connect the study of the Mather set with the theory of best Lipschitz maps.</description>

      <title>A unified model of horizontal differentiation with general spaces and irrational consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new microeconomic model of horizontal differentiation that unifies and extends previous developments inspired by the seminal work of Hotelling (1929). Our framework incorporates boundedly rational consumers, an unlimited number of firms, and arbitrary differentiation spaces with Riemannian manifolds. We argue that Riemannian geometry provides a natural and powerful tool for analyzing such models, offering fresh insights into firm behavior and market structure with complex products.</description>

      <title>Stringy Corrections to Heterotic SU(3)-Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the $\alpha'^2$ corrections to the supersymmetry algebra constructed by Bergshoeff de Roo for heterotic compactifications on SU(3) manifolds. The geometry remains complex, conformally balanced, but H and the hermitian form $\omega$ are corrected to $H = i(\partial - \bar\partial)\omega + \alpha' P$, with P determined in terms of dH. The supersymmetry algebra is integrable if and only if the graviton equation of motion is corrected, though the correction is pure gauge. We derive the same condition independently from hermitian geometry. The curvature of the tangent bundle connection acquires a nonzero (0,2) component with its trace fixed in terms of dH.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a bounded domain of class $C^{2+\alpha}$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. We show that if $n\geq 3$ and $u_\Omega$ is the maximal solution of equation $\Delta u = n(n-2)u^{(n+2)/(n-2)}$ in $\Omega$, then the hyperbolic radius $v_\Omega=u_\Omega^{-2/(n-2)}$ is of class $C^{2+\alpha}$ up to the boundary. The argument rests on a reduction to a nonlinear Fuchsian elliptic PDE.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a bounded domain of class $C^{2+\alpha}$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. We show that if $u$ is the solution of $\Delta u = 4\exp(2u)$ which tends to $+\infty$ as $(x,y)\to\partial\Omega$, then the hyperbolic radius $v=\exp(-u)$ is also of class $C^{2+\alpha}$ up to the boundary. The proof relies on new Schauder estimates for degenerate elliptic equations of Fuchsian type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a classification of homogeneous star products on duals of Lie algebroids in terms of the second Lie algebroid cohomology. Moreover, we extend this classification to projectable star products, i.e., to quantizations compatible with (coisotropic) reduction. This implies that quantization commutes with reduction in the considered setting.</description>

Abstract: We propose a natural intrinsic extension of the ridge regression from Euclidean spaces to general manifolds, which relies on Riemannian least-squares fitting, empirical covariance, and Mahalanobis distance. We utilize it for time-series prediction and apply the approach to forecast hurricane tracks and their wind speeds.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) is a recent generative modelling technique: we aim to learn how to sample from distribution $\mathfrak{X}_1$ by flowing samples from some distribution $\mathfrak{X}_0$ that is easy to sample from. The key trick is that this flow field can be trained while conditioning on the end point in $\mathfrak{X}_1$: given an end point, simply move along a straight line segment to the end point (Lipman et al. 2022). However, straight line segments are only well-defined on Euclidean space. Consequently, Chen and Lipman (2023) generalised the method to FM on Riemannian manifolds, replacing line segments with geodesics or their spectral approximations. We take an alternative point of view: we generalise to FM on Lie groups by instead substituting exponential curves for line segments. This leads to a simple, intrinsic, and fast implementation for many matrix Lie groups, since the required Lie group operations (products, inverses, exponentials, logarithms) are simply given by the corresponding matrix operations. FM on Lie groups could then be used for generative modelling with data consisting of sets of features (in $\mathbb{R}^n$) and poses (in some Lie group), e.g. the latent codes of Equivariant Neural Fields (Wessels et al. 2025).</description>

      <title>Universal Collection of Euclidean Invariants between Pairs of Position-Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean E(3) equivariant neural networks that employ scalar fields on position-orientation space M(3) have been effectively applied to tasks such as predicting molecular dynamics and properties. To perform equivariant convolutional-like operations in these architectures one needs Euclidean invariant kernels on M(3) x M(3). In practice, a handcrafted collection of invariants is selected, and this collection is then fed into multilayer perceptrons to parametrize the kernels. We rigorously describe an optimal collection of 4 smooth scalar invariants on the whole of M(3) x M(3). With optimal we mean that the collection is independent and universal, meaning that all invariants are pertinent, and any invariant kernel is a function of them. We evaluate two collections of invariants, one universal and one not, using the PONITA neural network architecture. Our experiments show that using a collection of invariants that is universal positively impacts the accuracy of PONITA significantly.</description>

      <title>Roto-Translation Invariant Metrics on Position-Orientation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Riemannian metrics on the position-orientation space M(3) that are roto-translation group SE(3) invariant play a key role in image analysis tasks like enhancement, denoising, and segmentation. These metrics enable roto-translation equivariant algorithms, with the associated Riemannian distance often used in implementation.
  However, computing the Riemannian distance is costly, which makes it unsuitable in situations where constant recomputation is needed. We propose the mav (minimal angular velocity) distance, defined as the Riemannian length of a geometrically meaningful curve, as a practical alternative.
  We see an application of the mav distance in geometric deep learning. Namely, neural networks architectures such as PONITA, relies on geometric invariants to create their roto-translation equivariant model. The mav distance offers a trainable invariant, with the parameters that determine the Riemannian metric acting as learnable weights.
  In this paper we: 1) classify and parametrize all SE(3) invariant metrics on M(3), 2) describes how to efficiently calculate the mav distance, and 3) investigate if including the mav distance within PONITA can positively impact its accuracy in predicting molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Extension of algebroids Part I: The Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series of two papers we will generalise the concept of extending a Lie algebroid by a Lie algebra bundle, leading to a notion of extending a Lie algebroid by another Lie algebroid whose orbits lie in the orbits of the former algebroid. The resulting Lie algebroid's anchor will be the sum of the two initial anchors such that the constructions will be similar to matched pairs of Lie algebroids, but with the major difference that we will allow curvatures. In this part of this series we will focus on the canonical construction making use of strict covariant adjustments, a generalisation of Maurer-Cartan forms in the context of gauge theories equipped with a Lie groupoid action instead of a Lie group action. That is, a Cartan connection with certain conditions on the curvature. The second paper will introduce and explain the obstruction of the extension provided here. Examples will include locally split structures as in Poisson geometry.
  As a side result we achieve strong hints towards a possible obstruction theory for certain Cartan connections on Lie algebroids, which will be related to the obstruction of (non-trivial) action algebroids; generalising the statement of the action algebroid structure induced by flat Cartan connections.</description>

      <title>Covering instability for the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a closed non-orientable $3$-manifold admits a positive scalar curvature metric if and only if its orientation double cover does; however, for each $4\le n\le 7$, there exist infinitely many smooth non-orientable $n$-manifolds $M$ that are mutually non-homotopy equivalent, such that the orientation double cover of $M$ admits positive scalar curvature metrics, but every closed smooth manifold that is homotopy equivalent to $M$ cannot admit positive scalar curvature metrics. These examples were first introduced by Alpert-Balitskiy-Guth in the study of Urysohn widths.
  To prove the nonexistence result, we extend the Schoen-Yau inductive descent approach to non-orientable manifolds. We also discuss band width estimates and the notion of enlargeability for non-orientable PSC manifolds.</description>

      <title>An ansatz for constructing explicit solutions of Hessian equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a (variation of quadrics) ansatz for constructing explicit, real-valued solutions to broad classes of complex Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ and real Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the complex setting, our method simultaneously addresses the deformed Hermitian--Yang--Mills/Leung--Yau--Zaslow (dHYM/LYZ) equation, the Monge--Amp\`ere equation, and the $J$-equation. Under this ansatz each PDE reduces to a second-order system of ordinary differential equations admitting explicit first integrals. These ODE systems integrate in closed form via abelian integrals, producing wide families of explicit solutions together with a detailed description. In particular, on $\mathbb{C}^3$, we construct entire dHYM/LYZ solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase, and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ we produce entire special Lagrangian solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase. More generally, in any complex or real dimension, our ansatz yields entire solutions of certain subcritical phases for both the dHYM/LYZ and special Lagrangian equations. Some of these solutions develop singularities on compact regions. In the special Lagrangian case we show that, after a natural extension across the singular locus, these blow-up solutions coincide with previously known complete special Lagrangian submanifolds obtained via a different ansatz.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin, and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three, and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homology of three-manifolds -- and its novel Atiyah-Floer type correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. In the 8d case, one can also derive higher $A_{\infty}$-categories, such as a novel Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-3-category that 3-categorifies the Haydys-Witten Floer homology of four-manifolds via a 4d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the theory. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], our work furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3], Doan-Rezchikov [4], and Cao [5].</description>

      <title>Exceptional Symmetry as a Source of Algebraic Cycles: Non-Constructive Methods for the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical variational Hodge structure theory characterizes the algebraicity of Hodge classes by studying the transversality of period mappings under geometric deformations. However, when algebraic varieties lack appropriate deformation families, this method faces applicability limitations. This paper develops a non-constructive method based on exceptional Lie group constraints to handle such cases. Our main technical contribution is establishing a dimension control mechanism for Spencer cohomology theory under Lie group constraints. Specifically, we prove that when a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ is equipped with $E_7$ group constraints, the corresponding Spencer kernel $\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1}$ has complex dimension simultaneously constrained by two bounds: representation theory gives the lower bound $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} \geq 56$, while the degenerate Spencer-de Rham mapping gives the upper bound $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} \leq h^{1,1}(X)$. For 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds satisfying $h^{1,1}(X) = 56$, this dimension constraint becomes the equality $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} = 56 = h^{1,1}(X)$. Combined with our established Spencer-calibration equivalence principle, this dimension matching result is sufficient to verify the $(1,1)$-type Hodge conjecture. Our proof completely avoids explicit algebraic cycle construction, instead achieving the goal through abstract dimensional arguments. This method demonstrates the application potential of Lie group representation theory in algebraic geometry, providing new theoretical tools for handling geometric objects where traditional deformation methods are not applicable.</description>
