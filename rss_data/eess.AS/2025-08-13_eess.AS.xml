      <title>Exploring Disentangled Neural Speech Codecs from Self-Supervised Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs), which use neural networks to generate compact audio representations, have garnered interest for their applicability to many downstream tasks -- especially quantized codecs due to their compatibility with large language models. However, unlike text, speech conveys not only linguistic content but also rich paralinguistic features. Encoding these elements in an entangled fashion may be suboptimal, as it limits flexibility. For instance, voice conversion (VC) aims to convert speaker characteristics while preserving the original linguistic content, which requires a disentangled representation. Inspired by VC methods utilizing $k$-means quantization with self-supervised features to disentangle phonetic information, we develop a discrete NAC capable of structured disentanglement. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves reconstruction performance on par with conventional NACs that do not explicitly perform disentanglement, while also matching the effectiveness of conventional VC techniques.</description>

      <title>Joint decoding method for controllable contextual speech recognition based on Speech LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual speech recognition refers to the ability to identify preferences for specific content based on contextual information. Recently, leveraging the contextual understanding capabilities of Speech LLM to achieve contextual biasing by injecting contextual information through prompts have emerged as a research hotspot.However, the direct information injection method via prompts relies on the internal attention mechanism of the model, making it impossible to explicitly control the extent of information injection. To address this limitation, we propose a joint decoding method to control the contextual information. This approach enables explicit control over the injected contextual information and achieving superior recognition performance. Additionally, Our method can also be used for sensitive word suppression recognition.Furthermore, experimental results show that even Speech LLM not pre-trained on long contextual data can acquire long contextual capabilities through our method.</description>

      <title>MultiAiTutor: Child-Friendly Educational Multilingual Speech Generation Tutor with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in personalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-world applications for language learning in children's education. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiAiTutor, an educational multilingual generative AI tutor with child-friendly designs, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for educational purposes. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages: Singaporean-accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiAiTutor compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Transient Noise Removal via Diffusion-based Speech Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present PGDI, a diffusion-based speech inpainting framework for restoring missing or severely corrupted speech segments. Unlike previous methods that struggle with speaker variability or long gap lengths, PGDI can accurately reconstruct gaps of up to one second in length while preserving speaker identity, prosody, and environmental factors such as reverberation. Central to this approach is classifier guidance, specifically phoneme-level guidance, which substantially improves reconstruction fidelity. PGDI operates in a speaker-independent manner and maintains robustness even when long segments are completely masked by strong transient noise, making it well-suited for real-world applications, such as fireworks, door slams, hammer strikes, and construction noise. Through extensive experiments across diverse speakers and gap lengths, we demonstrate PGDI's superior inpainting performance and its ability to handle challenging acoustic conditions. We consider both scenarios, with and without access to the transcript during inference, showing that while the availability of text further enhances performance, the model remains effective even in its absence.

      <title>EGGCodec: A Robust Neural Encodec Framework for EGG Reconstruction and F0 Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0 extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69 Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\%. Moreover, extensive ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec.</description>

      <title>LPGNet: A Lightweight Network with Parallel Attention and Gated Fusion for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) aims to predict the emotional state of each utterance by using multiple input types, such as text and audio. While Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in this task, they often face two major issues: high computational cost and heavy dependence on speaker information. These problems reduce their ability to generalize in real-world conversations. To solve these challenges, we propose LPGNet, a Lightweight network with Parallel attention and Gated fusion for multimodal ERC. The main part of LPGNet is the Lightweight Parallel Interaction Attention (LPIA) module. This module replaces traditional stacked Transformer layers with parallel dot-product attention, which can model both within-modality and between-modality relationships more efficiently. To improve emotional feature learning, LPGNet also uses a dual-gated fusion method. This method filters and combines features from different input types in a flexible and dynamic way. In addition, LPGNet removes speaker embeddings completely, which allows the model to work independently of speaker identity. Experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset show that LPGNet reaches over 87% accuracy and F1-score in 4-class emotion classification. It outperforms strong baseline models while using fewer parameters and showing better generalization across speakers.</description>

      <title>DeCRED: Decoder-Centric Regularization for Encoder-Decoder Based Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective regularization for the internal language model induced by the decoder in encoder-decoder ASR models, thereby improving robustness and generalization in both in- and out-of-domain settings. The proposed method, Decoder-Centric Regularization in Encoder-Decoder (DeCRED), adds auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, enabling next token prediction via intermediate logits. Empirically, DeCRED reduces the mean internal LM BPE perplexity by 36.6% relative to 11 test sets. Furthermore, this translates into actual WER improvements over the baseline in 5 of 7 in-domain and 3 of 4 out-of-domain test sets, reducing macro WER from 6.4% to 6.3% and 18.2% to 16.2%, respectively. On TEDLIUM3, DeCRED achieves 7.0% WER, surpassing the baseline and encoder-centric InterCTC regularization by 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Finally, we compare DeCRED with OWSM v3.1 and Whisper-medium, showing competitive WERs despite training on much less data with fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Listen through the Sound: Generative Speech Restoration Leveraging Acoustic Context Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to speech restoration by integrating a context-related conditioning strategy. Specifically, we employ the diffusion-based generative restoration model, UNIVERSE++, as a backbone to evaluate the effectiveness of contextual representations. We incorporate acoustic context embeddings extracted from the CLAP model, which capture the environmental attributes of input audio. Additionally, we propose an Acoustic Context (ACX) representation that refines CLAP embeddings to better handle various distortion factors and their intensity in speech signals. Unlike content-based approaches that rely on linguistic and speaker attributes, ACX provides contextual information that enables the restoration model to distinguish and mitigate distortions better. Experimental results indicate that context-aware conditioning improves both restoration performance and its stability across diverse distortion conditions, reducing variability compared to content-based methods.</description>

      <title>Selection of Layers from Self-supervised Learning Models for Predicting Mean-Opinion-Score of Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models like Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM have been widely used in speech processing. These transformer-based models consist of multiple layers, each capturing different levels of representation. While prior studies explored their layer-wise representations for efficiency and performance, speech quality assessment (SQA) models predominantly rely on last-layer features, leaving intermediate layers underexamined. In this work, we systematically evaluate different layers of multiple SSL models for predicting mean-opinion-score (MOS). Features from each layer are fed into a lightweight regression network to assess effectiveness. Our experiments consistently show early-layers features outperform or match those from the last layer, leading to significant improvements over conventional approaches and state-of-the-art MOS prediction models. These findings highlight the advantages of early-layer selection, offering enhanced performance and reduced system complexity.</description>

      <title>DualSpeechLM: Towards Unified Speech Understanding and Generation via Dual Speech Token Modeling with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08961v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges: (1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens, extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features, while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.</description>

      <title>Neutone SDK: An Open Source Framework for Neural Audio Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural audio processing has unlocked novel methods of sound transformation and synthesis, yet integrating deep learning models into digital audio workstations (DAWs) remains challenging due to real-time / neural network inference constraints and the complexities of plugin development. In this paper, we introduce the Neutone SDK: an open source framework that streamlines the deployment of PyTorch-based neural audio models for both real-time and offline applications. By encapsulating common challenges such as variable buffer sizes, sample rate conversion, delay compensation, and control parameter handling within a unified, model-agnostic interface, our framework enables seamless interoperability between neural models and host plugins while allowing users to work entirely in Python. We provide a technical overview of the interfaces needed to accomplish this, as well as the corresponding SDK implementations. We also demonstrate the SDK's versatility across applications such as audio effect emulation, timbre transfer, and sample generation, as well as its adoption by researchers, educators, companies, and artists alike. The Neutone SDK is available at https://github.com/Neutone/neutone_sdk</description>

      <title>TurboBias: Universal ASR Context-Biasing powered by GPU-accelerated Phrase-Boosting Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing specific key phrases is an essential task for contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most existing context-biasing approaches have limitations associated with the necessity of additional model training, significantly slow down the decoding process, or constrain the choice of the ASR system type. This paper proposes a universal ASR context-biasing framework that supports all major types: CTC, Transducers, and Attention Encoder-Decoder models. The framework is based on a GPU-accelerated word boosting tree, which enables it to be used in shallow fusion mode for greedy and beam search decoding without noticeable speed degradation, even with a vast number of key phrases (up to 20K items). The obtained results showed high efficiency of the proposed method, surpassing the considered open-source context-biasing approaches in accuracy and decoding speed. Our context-biasing framework is open-sourced as a part of the NeMo toolkit.</description>

      <title>XEmoRAG: Cross-Lingual Emotion Transfer with Controllable Intensity Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot emotion transfer in cross-lingual speech synthesis refers to generating speech in a target language, where the emotion is expressed based on reference speech from a different source language. However, this task remains challenging due to the scarcity of parallel multilingual emotional corpora, the presence of foreign accent artifacts, and the difficulty of separating emotion from language-specific prosodic features. In this paper, we propose XEmoRAG, a novel framework to enable zero-shot emotion transfer from Chinese to Thai using a large language model (LLM)-based model, without relying on parallel emotional data. XEmoRAG extracts language-agnostic emotional embeddings from Chinese speech and retrieves emotionally matched Thai utterances from a curated emotional database, enabling controllable emotion transfer without explicit emotion labels. Additionally, a flow-matching alignment module minimizes pitch and duration mismatches, ensuring natural prosody. It also blends Chinese timbre into the Thai synthesis, enhancing rhythmic accuracy and emotional expression, while preserving speaker characteristics and emotional consistency. Experimental results show that XEmoRAG synthesizes expressive and natural Thai speech using only Chinese reference audio, without requiring explicit emotion labels. These results highlight XEmoRAG's capability to achieve flexible and low-resource emotional transfer across languages.

      <title>3DFacePolicy: Audio-Driven 3D Facial Animation Based on Action Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has achieved significant progress in both research and applications. While recent baselines struggle to generate natural and continuous facial movements due to their frame-by-frame vertex generation approach, we propose 3DFacePolicy, a pioneer work that introduces a novel definition of vertex trajectory changes across consecutive frames through the concept of "action". By predicting action sequences for each vertex that encode frame-to-frame movements, we reformulate vertex generation approach into an action-based control paradigm. Specifically, we leverage a robotic control mechanism, diffusion policy, to predict action sequences conditioned on both audio and vertex states. Extensive experiments on VOCASET and BIWI datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is particularly expert in dynamic, expressive and naturally smooth facial animations.</description>

      <title>Learning Marmoset Vocal Patterns with a Masked Autoencoder for Robust Call Segmentation, Classification, and Caller Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23279v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The marmoset, a highly vocal primate, is a key model for studying social-communicative behavior. Unlike human speech, marmoset vocalizations are less structured, highly variable, and recorded in noisy, low-resource conditions. Learning marmoset communication requires joint call segmentation, classification, and caller identification -- challenging domain tasks. Previous CNNs handle local patterns but struggle with long-range temporal structure. We applied Transformers using self-attention for global dependencies. However, Transformers show overfitting and instability on small, noisy annotated datasets. To address this, we pretrain Transformers with MAE -- a self-supervised method reconstructing masked segments from hundreds of hours of unannotated marmoset recordings. The pretraining improved stability and generalization. Results show MAE-pretrained Transformers outperform CNNs, demonstrating modern self-supervised architectures effectively model low-resource non-human vocal communication.</description>

      <title>Gotta Hear Them All: Towards Sound Source Aware Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs describing an audio scene, such as images or texts. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware Audio (SS2A) generator. SS2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to clearly measure localized audio relevance. With the effectiveness of explicit sound source modeling, SS2A achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive image-to-audio tasks. We also qualitatively demonstrate SS2A's ability to achieve intuitive synthesis control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Furthermore, we show that our sound source modeling can achieve competitive video-to-audio performance with a straightforward temporal aggregation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Dopamine Audiobook: A Training-free MLLM Agent for Emotional and Immersive Audiobook Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audiobook generation aims to create rich, immersive listening experiences from multimodal inputs, but current approaches face three critical challenges: (1) the lack of synergistic generation of diverse audio types (e.g., speech, sound effects, and music) with precise temporal and semantic alignment; (2) the difficulty in conveying expressive, fine-grained emotions, which often results in machine-like vocal outputs; and (3) the absence of automated evaluation frameworks that align with human preferences for complex and diverse audio. To address these issues, we propose Dopamine Audiobook, a novel unified training-free multi-agent system, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves two specialized roles (i.e., speech designer and audio designer) for emotional, human-like, and immersive audiobook generation and evaluation. Specifically, we firstly propose a flow-based, context-aware framework for diverse audio generation with word-level semantic and temporal alignment. To enhance expressiveness, we then design word-level paralinguistic augmentation, utterance-level prosody retrieval, and adaptive TTS model selection. Finally, for evaluation, we introduce a novel MLLM-based evaluation framework incorporating self-critique, perspective-taking, and psychological MagicEmo prompts to ensure human-aligned and self-aligned assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple metrics. Importantly, our evaluation framework shows better alignment with human preferences and transferability across audio tasks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Marco-Voice and https://huggingface.co/datasets/AIDC-AI/CSEMOTIONS respectively.</description>

      <title>REINA: Regularized Entropy Information-Based Loss for Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.</description>

      <title>Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</description>
