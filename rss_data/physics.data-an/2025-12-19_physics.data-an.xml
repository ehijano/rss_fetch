      <title>Applying Gaussian Mixture Models to Track Reconstruction in Inelastic Scattering Experiments with Active Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active targets such as ACTAR TPC are well suited for studying giant resonances in unstable nuclei via inelastic scattering in inverse kinematics. A key challenge in such measurements is the detection of low-energy ejectiles emitted at small angles relative to the beam direction. Accurate reconstruction of these tracks is essential for disentangling different resonance modes. Probabilistic models such as the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) are particularly effective in capturing the complex covariance structures characteristic of the beam-recoil interface in narrow-angle events. In this work, we present a track reconstruction approach based on the GMM, specifically designed for inelastic scattering experiments with active targets. Special emphasis is placed on the treatment of low-energy tracks. The proposed method is demonstrated on simulated data of the $^{58}\mathrm{Ni}(\alpha,\alpha')^{58}\mathrm{Ni}$ reaction at an incident energy of $E=49$~MeV/nucleon, generated under conditions representative of the experiment carried out at GANIL for the same reaction.</description>

      <title>KAN-Matrix: Visualizing Nonlinear Pairwise and Multivariate Contributions for Physical Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering interpretable mathematical relationships from data, offering a novel route to both scientific discovery and efficient empirical modelling. This article introduces the Special Issue on Symbolic Regression for the Physical Sciences, motivated by the Royal Society discussion meeting held in April 2025. The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.
  The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity. Finally we emphasise emerging directions, particularly the incorporation of symmetry constraints, asymptotic behaviour and other theoretical information. Taken together, the papers in this Special Issue illustrate the accelerating progress of SR and its growing relevance across the physical sciences.</description>

      <title>Complete Decomposition of Anomalous Diffusion in Variable Speed Generalized L\'evy Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable Speed Generalized L\'{e}vy Walks (VGLWs) are a class of spatio-temporally coupled stochastic processes that unify a broad range of previously studied models within a single parametrized framework. Their dynamics consist of discrete random steps, or flights, during which the walker's speed varies deterministically with both the elapsed time and the total duration of the flight. We investigate the anomalous diffusive behavior of VGLWs and analyze it through decomposition into the three fundamental constitutive effects that capture violations of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT): the Joseph effect, reflecting long-range increment correlations, the Noah effect, arising from heavy-tailed step-size distributions with infinite variance, and the Moses effect, associated with statistical aging and non-stationarity. Our results show that anomalous diffusion in VGLWs is typically generated by a nontrivial combination of all three effects, rather than being attributable to a single mechanism. Strikingly, we find that within the VGLW framework the Noah exponent $L$, which quantifies the strength of the Noah effect, is unbounded from above, revealing a richer and more extreme landscape of anomalous diffusion than in previously studied L\'{e}vy-walk-type models.</description>

      <title>Resummed Distribution Functions: Making Perturbation Theory Positive and Normalized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixed-order perturbative calculations for differential cross sections can suffer from non-physical artifacts: they can be non-positive, non-normalizable, and non-finite, none of which occur in experimental measurements. We propose a framework, the Resummed Distribution Function (RDF), that, given a perturbative calculation for an observable to some finite order in $\alpha_s$, will ``resum'' the expression in a way that is guaranteed to match the original expression order-by-order and be positive, normalized, and finite. Moreover, our ansatz parameterizes all possible finite, positive, and normalized completions consistent with the original fixed-order expression, which can include N$^n$LL resummed expressions. The RDF also enables a more direct notion of perturbative uncertainties, as we can directly vary higher-order parameters and treat them as nuisance parameters. We demonstrate the power of the RDF ansatz by matching to thrust to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ and extracting $\alpha_s$ with perturbative uncertainties by fitting the RDF to ALEPH data.</description>
