      <title>scores: A Python package for verifying and evaluating models and predictions with xarray and pandas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: `scores` is a Python package containing mathematical functions for the verification, evaluation and optimisation of forecasts, predictions or models. It primarily supports the geoscience communities; in particular, the meteorological, climatological and oceanographic communities. In addition to supporting the Earth system science communities, it also has wide potential application in machine learning and other domains such as economics. `scores` not only includes common scores (e.g. Mean Absolute Error), it also includes novel scores not commonly found elsewhere (e.g. FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) score, Flip-Flop Index), complex scores (e.g. threshold-weighted continuous ranked probability score), and statistical tests (such as the Diebold Mariano test). It also contains isotonic regression which is becoming an increasingly important tool in forecast verification and can be used to generate stable reliability diagrams. Additionally, it provides pre-processing tools for preparing data for scores in a variety of formats including cumulative distribution functions (CDF). At the time of writing, `scores` includes over 50 metrics, statistical techniques and data processing tools. All of the scores and statistical techniques in this package have undergone a thorough scientific and software review. Every score has a companion Jupyter Notebook tutorial that demonstrates its use in practice. `scores` primarily supports `xarray` datatypes for Earth system data, allowing it to work with NetCDF4, HDF5, Zarr and GRIB data sources among others. `scores` uses Dask for scaling and performance. It has expanding support for `pandas`. The software repository can be found at https://github.com/nci/scores/</description>

      <title>Targeted marine cloud brightening can dampen El Ni\~no</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many record-breaking climate extremes arise from both greenhouse gas-induced warming and natural climate variability. Marine cloud brightening, a solar geoengineering strategy originally proposed to reduce long-term warming, could potentially mitigate extreme events by instead targeting seasonal phenomena, such as El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). By exploiting the 2019-2020 Australian wildfire experiment-of-opportunity, we show that simulated marine cloud brightening in the southeast Pacific reproduces observed cloud changes and induces La Ni\~na-like responses. We then explore how cloud brightening timing and duration modifies the 1997-1998 and 2015-2016 El Ni\~no events. We find the earliest and longest interventions effectively restore neutral ENSO conditions and dampen El Ni\~no's impacts. Solar geoengineering that targets climate variability could complement tools such as ENSO forecasting and provide a pathway for climate risk mitigation.</description>

      <title>Diffuse fraction as a tool for exploring the sensitivity of parametric clear-sky models to changing aerosol conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosols' impact on the performance of a clear-sky solar irradiance model is often evaluated from the perspective of the overall accuracy of estimates. This study assesses the aerosol role in clear-sky solar irradiance modelling from a totally different perspective, namely the ability of a model to accurately separate global solar irradiance into its fundamental direct and diffuse components. In an innovative approach, the analysis is focused on the sensitivity of parametric solar irradiance models to changes in aerosol conditions. A new measure, the aerosol influence quantifier, is introduced for assessing the correlation strength between the relative variation in clear-sky diffuse fraction and the relative variation in atmospheric aerosol load. The effectiveness of the aerosol influence quantifier is explored as a tool for assessing the sensitivity of three parametric clear-sky models to variations in input aerosol data. A rather surprising result is reported, e.g. if high quality aerosol data are not available, one could potentially maximize the estimate's accuracy by using a parametric clear-sky solar irradiance model with low sensitivity to aerosol variations. In such cases, it is shown that the aerosol influence quantifier can be used as a tool for identifying an adequate model for input data with a given uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Robust intensification of global ocean Eddy Kinetic Energy from three decades of satellite altimetry observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean mesoscale variability, a key component of the climate system, influences ocean circulation and heat, gas, carbon and nutrient distribution. Trends on Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE), a metric measuring its intensity, are investigated using two products constructed from 30 years of altimetric observations. Statistically significant positive trends in globally-averaged EKE reveal a strengthening of 1-3% per decade. Regions of intense mesoscale activity become more energetic than other areas. Robust positive EKE trends are observed in the Kuroshio Extension and the Gulf Stream, with remarkable EKE increases of ~50% and ~20%, respectively, over the last decade. Our study opens a new question into how the observed Gulf Stream strengthening impacts the AMOC, and challenges existing climate models emphasizing the necessity for improved small-scale ocean process representation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spectral Element Method for the Euler Equations on Unbounded Domains in Multiple Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating the impact of waves leaving a numerical domain has been a persistent challenge in numerical modeling. Reducing wave reflection at the domain boundary is crucial for accurate simulations. Absorbing layers, while common, often incur significant computational costs. This paper introduces an efficient application of a Legendre-Laguerre basis for absorbing layers for two-dimensional non-linear compressible Euler equations. The method couples a spectral-element bounded domain with a semi-infinite region, employing a tensor product of Lagrange and scaled Laguerre basis functions. Semi-infinite elements are used in the absorbing layer with Rayleigh damping. In comparison to existing methods with similar absorbing layer extensions, this approach, a pioneering application to the Euler equations of compressible and stratified flows, demonstrates substantial computational savings. The study marks the first application of semi-infinite elements to mitigate wave reflection in the solution of the Euler equations, particularly in nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling. A comprehensive set of tests demonstrates the method's versatility for general systems of conservation laws, with a focus on its effectiveness in damping vertically propagating mountain gravity waves, a benchmark for atmospheric models. Across all tests, the model presented in this paper consistently exhibits notable performance improvements compared to a traditional Rayleigh damping approach.</description>
