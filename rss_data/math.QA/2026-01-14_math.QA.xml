      <title>Uniqueness of vertex operator algebras arising from GKO-construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of vertex operator algebras are constructed by GKO-construction, which is a generalization of 3A-algebra and 6A-algebra.
  It is proved their vertex operator algebra structures are unique under nonzero assumptions on some elements of braiding matrices.
  Furthermore, we show each of them is generated by weight two subspace, i.e. the Griess algebra.</description>

      <title>Optimization of maximal quantum f-divergences between unitary orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal quantum $f$-divergences - defined via the commutant Radon-Nikodym derivative provide a fundamental measure of distinguishability between quantum states in the operator convex setting. In this work, we determine the exact extremal values of these divergences over the unitary orbits of two quantum states. Using the integral representation of operator convex functions, majorization theory, Lidskii-type inequalities, and structural properties of Kubo-Ando means, we derive fully explicit spectral formulas for \[ \min_{U\in \mathbb U_n} \tilde S_f(\rho\|U^{*}\sigma U) \quad\text{and}\quad \max_{U\in \mathbb U_n} \tilde S_f(\rho\|U^{*}\sigma U), \] and identify the unitaries achieving these extrema. We show that the optimization reduces to spectral rearrangement: the minimum occurs when the decreasing eigenvalues of $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are paired, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $\rho$ with the increasing spectrum of $\sigma$. Consequently, the full range of the divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval between these two endpoints. We further compare our results with the recent unitary optimization framework for hockey-stick-based quantum $f$-divergences of Li and Yan (2025), highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two families. Our findings extend prior extremal analyses for Umegaki, R\'enyi, and Hellinger-type divergences, and illuminate the distinct noncommutative nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences.</description>

      <title>On the structure and representations of quantum graph algebras at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the specializations $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^\epsilon$ at roots of unity $\epsilon$ of odd order of the graph algebras, associated to a simply-connected complex semi-simple algebraic group $G$ and a compact oriented surface $\Sigma_{g,n}^{\circ}$ with genus $g$, $n$ punctures, and one boundary component. We prove that the central localizations of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^\epsilon$ and of its subalgebra $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^{u_\epsilon}$ of invariant elements under the coadjoint action of a small quantum group, are central simple algebras of PI degrees that we compute. Also, we describe their centers, and show they are integrally closed rings.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Parameterized families of 2+1d $G$-cluster states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a $G$-cluster Hamiltonian in 2+1 dimensions and analyze its properties. This model exhibits a $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, where the $2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ sector realizes a non-invertible symmetry obtained by condensing appropriate algebra objects in $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Using the symmetry interpolation method, we construct $S^1$- and $S^2$-parameterized families of short-range-entangled (SRE) states by interpolating an either invertible $0$-form or $1$-form symmetry contained in $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Applying an adiabatic evolution argument to this family, we analyze the pumped interface mode generated by this adiabatic process. We then explicitly construct the symmetry operator acting on the interface and show that the interface mode carries a nontrivial charge under this symmetry, thereby demonstrating the nontriviality of the parameterized family.</description>

      <title>Spectral Fusion Deformations for Locally Compact Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a deformation framework for $C^*$-algebras equipped with a coaction of a locally compact quantum group, formulated intrinsically at the level of spectral subspaces determined by the coaction. The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fr\'echet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions.
  Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.
  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction.</description>

      <title>Resolving Verlinde's formula of logarithmic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verlinde's formula for rational vertex operator algebras computes the fusion rules from the modular transformations of characters. In the non semisimple and non finite case, a logarithmic Verlinde formula has been proposed together with David Ridout. In this formula one replaces simple modules by their resolutions by standard modules. Here and under certain natural assumptions this conjecture is proven in generality.
  The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <title>Trace Formulas for Deformed W-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate trace formulas in $\varepsilon$-deformed W-algebras, highlighting a novel connection to the modular double of $\mathfrak{q}$-deformed W-algebras. In particular, we show that torus correlators in the additive (Yangian) setting reproduce sphere correlators in the trigonometric setup, possibly with the inclusion of a non-perturbative completion. From a dual perspective, this mechanism implements a gauge theoretic 2d$\to$3d uplift, where a circle direction in the world-sheet transmutes to a compact space-time direction in a non-trivial manner. We further discuss a unified picture of deformed W-algebras driven by trace formulas, suggesting a deeper algebraic layer related to the massive and massless form-factor approach to integrable QFT and 2d CFT.</description>

      <title>On amplified graph C*-algebras as cores of Cuntz-Krieger algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite directed acyclic graph $R$, we construct from it two graphs $E_R$ and $F_R$, one by adding a loop at every vertex of $R$ and one by replacing every arrow of $R$ by countably infinitely many arrows. We show that the graph C*-algebra $C^*(F_R)$ is isomorphic to the AF core of $C^*(E_R)$. Examples include C*-algebras of a quantum flag manifolds and quantum teardrops. We discuss in detail the quantum Grassmannian $Gr_q(2,4)$ and use our description as AF core to study its CW-structure.</description>

      <title>Classifying fusion rules of anyons or SymTFTs: A general algebraic formula for domain wall problems and quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.</description>
