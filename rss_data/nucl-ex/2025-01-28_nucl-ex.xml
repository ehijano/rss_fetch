      <title>Signature of the $\alpha$-clustering structure of Light Nuclei in Relativistic Nuclear Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "imaging-by-smashing" technique has been developed recently in relativistic nuclear collisions. By smashing heavy nuclei at RHIC and the LHC and analyzing the anisotropic expansion (flow) of the final state produced particles, unique information on the structure of the collided nuclei has been obtained. Existing efforts primarily focus on the colliding mode of heavy nuclei collisions. In contrast, nuclear structure studies with collisions of light nuclei and the fixed target mode, despite their significant impact and broad interest, have not been thoroughly explored. In this Letter, we investigate the $\alpha$-clustering signature of $^{20}$Ne and $^{16}$O in the fixed-target $^{208}$Pb--$^{20}$Ne and $^{208}$Pb--$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 68.5 GeV, using the parton transport model AMPT. The results of two- and four-particle cumulants of anisotropic flow demonstrate a robust $\alpha$-clustering signature that persists regardless of the complex dynamic evolution of the created systems. This study highlights the significant impact of the LHCb SMOG (SMOG2) project in discovering the $\alpha$-clustering signature of light nuclei at relativistic energies.</description>

      <title>Observing short-range correlations in nuclei through $\rho^0$ photo-production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-range correlations (SRCs) are a universal feature of nuclear structure. A wide range of measurements, primarily using electron scattering, have revealed SRC properties, such as their abundance in different nuclei, as well as the strong preference for proton-neutron pairing over proton-proton or neutron-neutron pairing. Despite the inherent complexity of many-body systems, a number of the salient features of electron scattering measurements are described by a simple, factorized theory called Generalized Contact Formalism. A key element of this theory, the factorization of the interaction with a hard probe, has yet to be tested. An experiment conducted at Jefferson Lab in 2021 collected data from scattering a tagged photon beam, with an energy up to 10 GeV, from several nuclear targets, measuring final state particles in the large-acceptance GlueX spectrometer. In this paper, we propose a test of probe factorization by verifying measuring cross section ratios sensitive to proton-proton pair prevalence and relative SRC abundances in $^4$He and $^{12}$C. We present GCF predictions of the observables and make projections of the expected precision the experiment can achieve.</description>

      <title>A hitchhiker's guide to nuclear polarization in muonic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider the so-called nuclear polarization correction to the 1S-levels in light to intermediate muonic atoms. An easy to use recipe to compute it is given. The calculation includes the effect of the nucleon polarization, i.e. the contribution from inelastic states in the hadronic range, and Coulomb corrections beyond the leading logarithm approximation to both nuclear and nucleon polarization. I provide numerical estimates for $4\leq Z\leq41$, compare to the estimates in the literature and discuss the need for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Investigating the pion emission source in pp collisions using the AMPT model with sub-nucleon structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of momentum correlations of identical pions serves as a fundamental tool for probing the space-time properties of the particle emitting source created in high-energy collisions. Recent experimental results have shown that, in pp collisions, the size of the one-dimensional primordial source depends on the transverse mass (\mt) of hadron pairs, following a common scaling behavior, similar to that observed in Pb--Pb collisions. In this work, a systematic study of the \pipi source function and correlation function is performed using the multiphase transport model (AMPT) to understand the properties of the emitting source created in high multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The \mt scaling behavior and pion emission source radii measured by ALICE experiment can be well described the model with sub-nucleon structure. These studies shed new light on the understanding of the effective size of the \pipi emission source and on studying the intensity interferometry in small systems with a transport model.</description>

      <title>Cluster configurations in Li isotopes in the variation of multi-bases of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cluster configurations in Li isotopes, which are described in the optimization of the multi-Slater determinants of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. Each Slater determinant in the superposition is determined simultaneously in the variation of the total energy. The configurations of the excited states are obtained by imposing the orthogonal condition to the ground-state configurations. In Li isotopes, various cluster configurations are confirmed and are related to the thresholds of the corresponding cluster emissions. For $^5$Li, we predict the $^3$He+$d$ clustering in the excited state as well as the mirror state of $^5$He with $^3$H+$d$. For $^{6-9}$Li, various combinations of the clusters are obtained in the ground and excited states, and the superposition of these basis states reproduces the observed energy spectra. For $^9$Li, we predict the linear-chain states consisting of various cluster configurations at 10--13 MeV of the excitation energy.</description>

Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions were recently employed as an "imaging-by-smashing" tool to reveal the global shapes of colliding nuclei. Here, I explain how nuclear shapes become encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Laser cooled 137BaF molecules for measuring nuclear-spin-dependent parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate optical cycling and transverse laser cooling of a beam of fermionic 137BaF molecules. Their high masses and nuclear spins make these molecules sensitive probes for parity violation and properties of the weak interaction. However, the nuclear spins also lead to a quasi-closed cycling transition currently involving up to 112 levels, which significantly exceeds the complexity in other laser-cooled molecules. Optical cycling and cooling are facilitated through carefully designed optical spectra tailored to this molecular structure. Our results pave the way for efficient state preparation, detection, and cooling in precision measurements using this species and other similar species.</description>

      <title>Girth and groomed radius of jets recoiling against isolated photons in lead-lead and proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents the first measurements of the groomed jet radius $R_\mathrm{g}$ and the jet girth $g$ in events with an isolated photon recoiling against a jet in lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The observables $R_\mathrm{g}$ and $g$ provide a quantitative measure of how narrow or broad a jet is. The analysis uses PbPb and pp data samples with integrated luminosities of 1.7 nb$^{-1}$ and 301 pb$^{-1}$, respectively, collected with the CMS experiment in 2018 and 2017. Events are required to have a photon with transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$ $&gt;$ 100 GeV and at least one jet back-to-back in azimuth with respect to the photon and with transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet}$ such that $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet} / p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$ $&gt;$ 0.4. The measured $R_\mathrm{g}$ and $g$ distributions are unfolded to the particle level, which facilitates the comparison between the PbPb and pp results and with theoretical predictions. It is found that jets with $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet} / p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$ $&gt;$ 0.8, i.e., those that closely balance the photon $p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$, are narrower in PbPb than in pp collisions. Relaxing the selection to include jets with $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet} / p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$ $&gt;$ 0.4 reduces the narrowing of the angular structure of jets in PbPb relative to the pp reference. This shows that selection bias effects associated with jet energy loss play an important role in the interpretation of jet substructure measurements.</description>

      <title>Measurement of photonuclear jet production in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the LHC, each nucleus acts a sources of high-energy real photons that can scatter off the opposing nucleus in ultra-peripheral photonuclear ($\gamma+A$) collisions. Hard scattering processes initiated by the photons in such collisions provide a novel method for probing nuclear parton distributions in a kinematic region not easily accessible to other measurements. ATLAS has measured production of dijet and multi-jet final states in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using a data set recorded in 2018 with an integrated luminosity of 1.72 $\text{nb}^{-1}$. Photonuclear final states are selected by requiring a rapidity gap in the photon direction; this selects events where one of the outgoing nuclei remains intact. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_\text{t}$ algorithm with radius parameter, $R = 0.4$. Triple-differential cross-sections, unfolded for detector response, are measured and presented using two sets of kinematic variables. The first set consists of the total transverse momentum ($H_\text{T}$),rapidity, and mass of the jet system. The second set uses $H_\text{T}$ and particle-level nuclear and photon parton momentum fractions, $x_\text{A}$ and $z_{\gamma}$, respectively. The results are compared with leading-order (LO) perturbative QCD calculations of photonuclear jet production cross-sections, where all LO predictions using existing fits fall below the data in the shadowing region. More detailed theoretical comparisons will allow these results to strongly constrain nuclear parton distributions, and these data provide results from the LHC directly comparable to early physics results at the planned Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal asymmetries in lepton and heavy-quark pair production in UPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal modulations in lepton and heavy-quark pair production in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of highly charged ions are investigated. The modulations in the azimuthal angles of the sum and difference of the transverse momenta of the pair of particles in the final state, as well as of the transverse impact parameter, arise from the collisions of unpolarized and polarized photons. A full description of the cross section in terms of Generalized Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) for photons is given including a careful consideration of the Fourier transform to impact parameter space. In particular, this leads to a feed-in mechanism among harmonics of different orders, which in principle generates harmonics of all (even) orders. Wherever comparable, our analytical results for the azimuthal modulations agree with those presented in other papers on this topic. Compared to these other works, we separate effects that arise from the anisotropies of the GTMDs from those that do not and retain terms proportional to the mass of the produced particles, as they are relevant for muon, charm and bottom quark production. We show that the normalized differential cross section changes considerably with the produced particle mass, which should be discernible in UPCs at RHIC and LHC. For the numerical results we adopt several models for the photon GTMD correlator, and find that all of them are in fairly good agreement with each other and with UPC data from STAR. We also present results for various azimuthal modulations for RHIC kinematics, where we compare $e^+ e^-$ production with the production of heavier particles, and for LHC kinematics, focusing on $\mu^+ \mu^-$ production. These results exhibit interesting mass-dependent features in the asymmetries that may help study the anisotropies arising from the underlying photon GTMD description.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Radon-222 concentration in N2 using an activated charcoal trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radon-222 is a limiting background in many leading dark matter and low energy neutrino experiments. One way to mitigate Radon-222 is to fill external experimental components with a clean cover gas such as N2. At the SNOLAB facility in Canada, the 222Rn concentration in the cover gas systems of the experiments are monitored using a radon assay board developed by the SNO collaboration. To improve the sensitivity of N2 assays, a new trapping mechanism based on activated charcoal has been developed. The trap was purified and tested at SNOLAB. The methods for determining the efficiency, background, and sensitivity of the trap were described. Additionally, as part of the efficiency measurement, a radon calibration source was developed and characterized.</description>
