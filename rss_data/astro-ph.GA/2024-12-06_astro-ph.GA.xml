      <title>Automated galaxy sizes in Euclid images using the Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar disk truncations, also referred to as galaxy edges, are key indicators of galactic size, determined by the radial location of the gas density threshold for star formation. Accurately measuring galaxy sizes for millions of galaxies is essential for understanding the physical processes driving galaxy evolution over cosmic time. In this study, we aim to explore the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model designed for image segmentation, to automatically identify disk truncations in galaxy images. With the Euclid Wide Survey poised to deliver vast datasets, our goal is to assess SAM's capability to measure galaxy sizes in a fully automated manner. SAM was applied to a labeled dataset of 1,047 disk-like galaxies with $M_* &gt; 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at redshifts up to $z \sim 1$, sourced from the HST CANDELS fields. We 'euclidized' the HST galaxy images by creating composite RGB images, using the F160W (H-band), F125W (J-band), and F814W + F606W (I-band + V-band) HST filters, respectively. Using these processed images as input for SAM, we retrieved various truncation masks for each galaxy image under different configurations of the input data. We find excellent agreement between the galaxy sizes identified by SAM and those measured manually (i.e., by using the radial positions of the stellar disk edges in galaxy light profiles), with an average deviation of approximately $3\%$. This error reduces to about $1\%$ when excluding problematic cases. Our results highlight the strong potential of SAM for detecting disk truncations and measuring galaxy sizes across large datasets in an automated way. SAM performs well without requiring extensive image preprocessing, labeled training datasets for truncations (used only for validation), fine-tuning, or additional domain-specific adaptations such as transfer learning.</description>

      <title>A nuclear spiral in a dusty star-forming galaxy at $z=2.78$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear structure of dusty star-forming galaxies is largely unexplored but harbours critical information about their structural evolution. Here, we present long-baseline Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA) continuum observations of a gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxy at $z=2.78$. We use a pixellated lens modelling analysis to reconstruct the rest-frame 230 $\rm\mu$m dust emission with a mean resolution of $\approx55$ pc and demonstrate that the inferred source properties are robust to changes in lens modelling methodology. The central 1 kpc is characterised by an exponential profile, a dual spiral arm morphology and an apparent super-Eddington compact central starburst. We find tentative evidence for a nuclear bar in the central 300 pc. These features may indicate that secular dynamical processes play a role in accumulating a high concentration of cold gas that fuels the rapid formation of a compact stellar spheroid and black hole accretion. We propose that the high spatial resolution provided by long-baseline ALMA observations and strong gravitational lensing will give key insights into the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Growth of Galaxy Stellar Haloes Over $0.2 \leq z \leq 1.1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies are predicted to assemble their stellar haloes through the accretion of stellar material from interactions with their cosmic environment. Observations that trace stellar halo buildup probe the processes that drive galaxy size and stellar mass growth. We investigate stellar halo assembly over $0.2 \leq z \leq 1.1$ in a mass-complete ($M_{\star} \geq 10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$) sample of 242,456 star-forming and 88,421 quiescent galaxies (SFGs and QGs) from the CLAUDS and HSC-SSP surveys. We extract galaxy rest-frame $g$-band surface brightness ($\mu_g$) profiles to study faint, extended emission in galaxy outskirts. We examine trends in galaxy assembly by analyzing the median $\mu_g$ profiles in different SFG and QG \msS ranges with decreasing redshift and connecting evolution in galaxy $\mu_g$ profiles with the underlying stellar mass growth in galaxies. Since $z=1.1$, the majority of evolution in the median $\mu_g$ profiles of galaxies ($\sim$64$\%$ in SFGs and $\sim$71$\%$ in QGs) occurs throughout their stellar halo regions (2-10$R_e$). More massive galaxies assemble stellar halo material more rapidly at $0.2 \leq z \leq 1.1$. Over this period, QGs grow a larger fraction of their stellar haloes than SFGs at fixed $M_{\star}$ (factor of $\sim$1.2). Although star formation can account for the stellar halo growth observed in low-mass SFGs ($10^{9.5}M_\odot \leq M_\star &lt; 10^{10.5}M_\odot$), high-mass SFGs ($M_\star \geq 10^{10.5}M_\odot$) and both low- and high-mass QGs require an additional assembly mechanism. Our results suggest accretion via minor mergers drives additional stellar halo growth in these galaxies. The contribution from accretion is larger in more massive galaxies (over $M_{\star} \geq 10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$), and QGs exhibit larger fractional increases to their ex-situ fractions over $0.2 \leq z \leq 1.1$ than SFGs at fixed $M_{\star}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the link between the 2175{\AA} dust absorption feature and PAHs in Nearby Star-Forming Galaxies using Swift/UVOT and JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2175{\AA} bump is a prominent absorption feature at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths in dust extinction and attenuation curves. Understanding the relative strength of this feature is important for accurate dust corrections at both low- and high-redshift. This feature is postulated to arise from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust grains; however, the carrier has not been definitively established. We present results on the correlation between the 2175{\AA} feature and PAH abundances in a spatially-resolved manner for 15 local galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST survey that have NUV and mid-IR imaging data from Swift/UVOT and JWST/MIRI, respectively. We find a moderate positive correlation between the 2175{\AA} feature strength and PAH abundance, albeit with large intrinsic scatter. However, most of this trend can be attributed to a stronger negative correlation of both quantities with SFR surface density and specific-SFR (proxies of ionising radiation). The latter trends are consistent with previous findings that both the 2175{\AA} carrier and PAHs are small grains that are easily destroyed by UV photons, although the proxy for PAH abundance could also be influenced by dust heating. When controlling for SFR surface density, we find weaker correlations between the 2175{\AA} feature and PAH abundances, disfavouring a direct link. However, analyses based on spectroscopic measurements of the 2175{\AA} feature and PAH features are required to verify our findings. No significant trends with gas-phase metallicity are found for the 2175{\AA} feature and PAHs, however the metallicity range of our sample is limited. We provide prescriptions for the strength of the 2175{\AA} feature and PAHs in local massive (metal-rich) galaxies with SFR surface density and specific-SFR, however the former should be used with caution since bump strengths measured from Swift/UVOT are expected to be underestimated.</description>

      <title>Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments in EAGLE: lifetimes and longevity of misaligned galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant processes by which galaxies replenish their cold gas reservoirs remain disputed, especially in massive galaxies. Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments offer an opportunity to study these replenishment processes. However, observed distributions of these misalignments conflict with current models of gas replenishment in early-type galaxies (ETGs), with longer relaxation timescales suggested as a possible solution. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the relaxation of unstable misaligned gas in galaxies with masses of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ between $0&lt;z&lt;1$. We extract misalignments from formation to relaxation providing a sample of $\sim3200$ relaxations. We find relaxation timescales tend to be short-duration, with median lifetimes of $\sim0.5$ Gyr, though with a notable population of unstable misalignments lasting $\gtrsim1$ Gyr. Relaxation time distributions show a log-linear relationship, with $\approx20\%$ of unstable misalignments persisting for $\gtrsim3$ torquing times. Long-lived unstable misalignments are predominantly found in galaxies with higher stellar masses, lower star-forming gas fractions, higher ongoing gas inflow, and which reside in the centres of dense environments. Mergers only cause $\sim17\%$ of unstable misalignments in EAGLE. We conclude that, at least in EAGLE, unstable kinematic misalignments are not predominantly driven by gas-rich minor mergers. Additionally, processes that significantly extend relaxation times are not dominant in the galaxy population. Instead, we see a diverse formation pathway for misalignments such as through hot halo cooling.</description>

      <title>MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase gas, with hot ($\sim10^6$K) and cold ($\sim10^4$K) gas, is ubiquitous in astrophysical media across a wide range of scales. However, simulating multiphase gas has been a long-standing challenge, due to the large separation between the size of cold gas structures and the scales at which such gas impacts the evolution of associated systems. In this study, we introduce a new subgrid framework for such multiphase gas, MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics, in multifluid AREPO. We develop this approach based on first principles and theoretical results from previous studies with resolved small-scale simulations, leading to a minimal number of free parameters in the formulation. We divide the interactions in the model into three sources: drag, turbulent mixing and cold gas growth. As part of the model, we also include two methods for estimating the local turbulent velocities, one using the Kolmogorov scaling, and the other using the local velocity gradients. We verify the different components of the framework through extensive comparison with benchmark single-fluid simulations across different simulation parameters, such as how resolved the cold gas is initially, the turbulent Mach number, spatial resolution, and random initialisation of turbulence. We test the complete scheme and a reduced version, with and without cold gas growth. We find a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement across the different simulation parameters and diagnostics for both local turbulent velocity estimation methods. We also reproduce behaviour like the cold gas survival criteria as an emergent property. We discuss the applications and possible extensions of MOGLI and demonstrate its capability by running a simulation which would be computationally prohibitive to run as a resolved single-fluid simulation.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphology in CANDELS: Addressing Evolutionary Changes Across $0.2 \leq z \leq 2.4$ with Hybrid Classification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological classification of galaxies becomes increasingly challenging with redshift. We apply a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method to classify $\sim 14,000$ galaxies in the CANDELS fields at $0.2 \leq z \leq 2.4$ into spheroid, disk, and irregular systems. Unlike previous works, our method is applied to redshift bins of width 0.2. Comparison between models applied to a wide redshift range versus bin-specific models reveals significant differences in galaxy morphology beyond $z \geq 1$ and a consistent $\sim 25\%$ disagreement. This suggests that using a single model across wide redshift ranges may introduce biases due to the large time intervals involved compared to galaxy evolution timescales. Using the FERENGI code to assess the impact of cosmological effects, we find that flux dimming and smaller angular scales may lead to the misclassification of up to $18\%$ of disk galaxies as spheroids or irregulars. Contrary to previous studies, we find an almost constant fraction of disks ($\sim 60\%$) and spheroids ($\sim 30\%$) across redshifts. We attribute discrepancies with earlier works, which suggest a decreasing fraction of disks beyond $z \sim 1$, to the biases introduced by visual classification. Our claim is further strengthened by the striking agreement to the results reported by Lee et al. (2024) using an objective, unsupervised method applied to James Webb Space Telescope data. Exploring mass dependence, we observe a $\sim 40\%$ increase in the fraction of massive ($M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$) spheroids with decreasing redshift, well balanced with a decrease of $\sim 20\%$ in the fraction of $M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ disks, suggesting that merging massive disk galaxies may form spheroidal systems.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Scale Magnetized Wind Around a Normal Star-Forming Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy formation theory identifies superwinds as a key regulator of star formation rates, galaxy growth, and chemical enrichment. Thermal and radiation pressure are known to drive galactic-scale winds in dusty starbursting galaxies (e.g. M82), but modern numerical simulations have recently highlighted that cosmic-ray (CR) driven winds may be especially important in normal galaxies with modest star formation rate surface densities. However, CR-driven winds have yet to be conclusively observed -- leaving significant uncertainty in their detailed microphysics. We present MeerKAT radio continuum and HI spectral-line observations of one such normal galaxy, NGC 1532; a nearby ($D\sim15\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) and edge-on ($i \gtrsim 80^{\circ}$) spiral galaxy tidally interacting with its smaller elliptical companion, NGC 1531. We find magnetized, highly-ordered radio continuum loops extending $\sim10$ kpc above and below the disk; visibly connecting discrete star-forming regions in the disk with the nucleus. The deep MeerKAT HI observations place an upper limit on the column density of neutral gas coincident with the outflow to $N_\mathrm{HI} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{19}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Unlike previously observed outflows -- for which ejected gas and dust can be traced across multiple wavelengths -- the loops in NGC 1532 show no detectable signs of dust or gas coincident with the radio emission far from the disk. We explore multiple possible mechanisms for driving this magnetic wind and favor an explanation where cosmic-ray pressure plays a significant role in launching these outflows.</description>

      <title>Evidence for environmental effects in the $z\,{=}\,4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA observations of the [CI] 492 and 806$\,$GHz fine-structure lines in 25 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z\,{=}\,4.3$ in the core of the SPT2349$-$56 protocluster. The protocluster galaxies exhibit a median $L^\prime_{[\text{CI}](2-1)}/L^\prime_{[\text{CI}](1-0)}$ ratio of 0.94 with an interquartile range of 0.81-1.24. These ratios are markedly different to those observed in DSFGs in the field (across a comparable redshift and 850$\,\mu$m flux density range), where the median is 0.55 with an interquartile range of 0.50-0.76, and we show that this difference is driven by an excess of [CI](2-1) in the protocluster galaxies for a given 850$\,\mu$m flux density. We estimate gas excitation temperatures of $T_{\rm ex}\,{=}\,59.1^{+8.1}_{-6.8}\,$K for our protocluster sample and $T_{\rm ex}\,{=}\,33.9^{+2.4}_{-2.2}\,$K for the field sample. Our main interpretation of this result is that the protocluster galaxies have had their cold gas driven to their cores via close-by interactions within the dense environment, leading to an overall increase in the average gas density and excitation temperature, and an elevated [CI](2-1) luminosity-to-far-infrared luminosity ratio.</description>

      <title>CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and grain size distribution through the analysis of $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$-$q_\mathrm{PAH}$ relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$) is expected to vary with dust abundance and grain size distribution through the efficiency of shielding gas from CO-dissociation radiation. We present a comprehensive analysis of $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ and grain size distribution for nearby galaxies, using the PAH fraction ($q_\mathrm{PAH}$) as an observable proxy of grain size distribution. We adopt the resolved observations at 2-kpc resolution in 42 nearby galaxies, where $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ is derived from measured metallicity and surface densities of dust and HI assuming a fixed dust-to-metals ratio. We use an analytical model for the evolution of H$_2$ and CO, in which the evolution of grain size distribution is controlled by the dense gas fraction ($\eta$). We find that the observed level of $q_\mathrm{PAH}$ is consistent with the diffuse-gas-dominated model ($\eta=0.2$) where dust shattering is more efficient. Meanwhile, the slight decreasing trend of observed $q_\mathrm{PAH}$ with metallicity is more consistent with high-$\eta$ predictions, likely due to the more efficient loss of PAHs by coagulation. We discuss how grain size distribution (indicated by $q_\mathrm{PAH}$) and metallicity impact $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$; we however did not obtain conclusive evidence that the grain size distribution affects $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$. Observations and model predictions show similar anti-correlation between $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ and 12+log(O/H). Meanwhile, there is a considerable difference in how resolved $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ behaves with $q_\mathrm{PAH}$. The observed $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ has a positive correlation with $q_\mathrm{PAH}$, while the model-predicted $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ does not have a definite correlation with $q_\mathrm{PAH}$. This difference is likely due to the limitation of one-zone treatment in the model.</description>

      <title>First Measurements of the 4-Point Correlation Function of Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence as a Novel Probe of the Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Interstellar Medium (ISM), gas and dust evolve under magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. This produces dense, non-linear structures that then seed star formation. Observationally and theoretically, turbulence is quantified by summary statistics such as the 2-Point Correlation Function (2PCF) or its Fourier-space analog the power spectrum. These cannot capture the non-Gaussian correlations coming from turbulence's highly non-linear nature. We here for the first time apply the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) to turbulence, measuring it on a large suite of MHD simulations that mirror, as well as currently possible, the conditions expected in the ISM. The 4PCF captures the dependence of correlations between quadruplets of density points on the geometry of the tetrahedron they form. Using a novel functionality added to the \textsc{sarabande} code specifically for this work, we isolate the purely non-Gaussian piece of the 4PCF. We then explore simulations with a range of pressures, $P$, and magnetic fields, $B$ (but without self-gravity); these are quantified by different sonic $(M_{\rm S})$ and Alfv\'enic $(M_{\rm A})$ Mach numbers. We show that the 4PCF has rich behavior that can in future be used as a diagnostic of ISM conditions. We also show that a large-scale coherent magnetic field leads to parity-odd modes of the 4PCF, a clean test of magnetic field coherence with observational ramifications. All our measurements of the 4PCF (10 $M_{\rm S}, M_{\rm A}$ combinations, 9 time-slices for each, 34 4PCF modes for each) are made public for the community to explore.</description>

      <title>Kinematic distances of galaxies in the Local Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the kinematic distances to nearby galaxies obtained by the Numerical Action Method (NAM) based on the Cosmic-flow-3 survey data. NAM distances are compared with 418 high-precision distances measured by the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method using the Hubble Space Telescope. We estimated the average difference &lt;D_NAM - D_TRGB&gt; = -0.30 +- 0.08 Mpc and the standard deviation of 1.57 Mpc. Approximately the same difference in the distance scale is obtained in comparison with less accurate distance estimates through the membership of galaxies in known groups or from the Tully-Fisher relation. We conclude that the NAM method provides distance estimates with an accuracy of 20% within the Local Volume, which is valid for ~90% of the sky, except for the regions of the Virgo cluster and the Coma-I group.</description>

      <title>The physical and chemical structure of Sagittarius B2, VIII. Full molecular line survey of hot cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The giant molecular cloud complex Sagittarius B2 (Sgr~B2) in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy hosts several high-mass star formation sites, with Sgr~B2(M) and Sgr~B2(N) being the main centers of activity. This analysis aims to comprehensively model each core spectrum, considering molecular lines, dust attenuation, and free-free emission interactions. We describe the molecular content analysis of each hot core and identify the chemical composition of detected sources. Using ALMA's high sensitivity, we aim to characterize the hot core population in Sgr~B2(M) and N, gaining a better understanding of the different evolutionary phases of star formation processes in this complex. We conducted an unbiased ALMA spectral line survey of 47 sources in band 6 (211-275 GHz). Chemical composition and column densities were derived using XCLASS, assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. Quantitative descriptions for each molecule were determined, considering all emission and absorption features across the spectral range. Temperature and velocity distributions were analyzed, and derived abundances were compared with other spectral line surveys. We identified 65 isotopologs from 48 different molecules, ranging from light molecules to complex organic compounds, originating from various environments. Most sources in the Sgr~B2 complex were assigned different evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation. Sgr~B2(N) hot cores show more complex molecules such as CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, while M cores contain lighter molecules such as SO$_2$, SO, and NO. Some sulfur-bearing molecules are more abundant in N than in M. The derived molecular abundances can be used for comparison and to constrain astrochemical models. Inner sources in both regions were generally more developed than outer sources, with some exceptions.</description>

      <title>The cosmic globular cluster formation history in the E-MOSAICS simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of globular cluster (GC) formation and evolution across the $34^3$ Mpc$^3$ volume of the E-MOSAICS galaxy formation simulations. Defining GCs as surviving, high-mass ($&gt;10^5$ M$_\odot$) clusters, we analyse their formation histories as a function of their metallicity and host galaxy mass, also distinguishing between central and satellite galaxies. The redshift of peak GC formation rate increases weakly with galaxy mass, decreases with metallicity, and does not differ between centrals and satellites. The epoch of peak GC formation precedes that of the stars by a factor of $1.1{-}1.6$, primarily due to `downsizing', i.e. low-mass galaxies form their stars later. Consequently, this offset decreases with galaxy mass, leading to nearly coeval stellar and GC populations in massive galaxies ($&gt;10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). GCs themselves do not exhibit strong downsizing, because they predominantly formed at early cosmic epochs conducive to the formation (through high gas pressures) and survival (through high galaxy merger and GC migration rates) of massive, compact stellar systems. The total GC formation rate in the volume peaks at $z\approx 2.5$, shortly before star formation peaks at $z\approx 2$, but well after the general cluster formation rate at $z\approx 4$, reflecting a survivor bias where surviving GCs formed more recently. We find that GC formation commenced early, at $z&gt;10$, such that the results of this work may provide a framework for interpreting direct observations of proto-GC formation with the JWST, especially as these observations accumulate to enable statistical studies.</description>

      <title>BEACON: JWST NIRCam Pure-parallel Imaging Survey. I. Survey Design and Initial Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Bias-free Extragalactic Analysis for Cosmic Origins with NIRCam (BEACON) survey, a JWST Cycle2 program allocated up to 600 pure-parallel hours of observations. BEACON explores high-latitude areas of the sky with JWST/NIRCam over $\sim100$ independent sightlines, totaling $\sim0.3$deg$^2$, reaching a median F444W depth of $\approx28.2$AB mag (5$\sigma$). Based on existing JWST observations in legacy fields, we estimate that BEACON will photometrically identify 25--150 galaxies at $z&gt;10$ and 500--1000 at $z\sim7$--10 uniquely enabled by an efficient multiple filter configuration spanning $0.9$--5.0$\mu$m. The expected sample size of $z&gt;10$ galaxies will allow us to obtain robust number density estimates and to discriminate between different models of early star formation. In this paper, we present an overview of the survey design and initial results using the first 19 fields. We present 129 galaxy candidates at $z&gt;7$ identified in those fields, including 11 galaxies at $z&gt;10$ and several UV-luminous ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-21$mag) galaxies at $z\sim8$. The number densities of $z&lt;13$ galaxies inferred from the initial fields are overall consistent with those in the literature. Despite reaching a considerably large volume ($\sim10^5$Mpc$^3$), however, we find no galaxy candidates at $z&gt;13$, providing us with a complimentary insight into early galaxy evolution with minimal cosmic variance. We publish imaging and catalog data products for these initial fields. Upon survey completion, all BEACON data will be coherently processed and distributed to the community along with catalogs for redshift and other physical quantities.</description>

      <title>The radio properties of the JWST-discovered AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the radio emission of spectroscopically confirmed, X-ray weak, Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) selected with JWST in the GOODS-N field, one of the fields with the best combination of deep radio observations and statistics of JWST-selected BLAGN. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144\,MHz, 1.5\,GHz, 3\,GHz, 5.5\,GHz, 10\,GHz), and we find that none of the 22 sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of $\sim 0.2\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, corresponding to a $3\sigma$ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of $L_{5GHz}=2\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the mean redshift of the sample $z\sim 5.2$. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found would suggest that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that $\sim$1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.</description>

      <title>Influence of mergers on LyC escape of high redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on the Lyman Continuum (LyC) radiation escape, fesc, from high-redshift galaxies. Methods: We post-process ~ 6e5 galaxies (redshift 5.2 &lt; z &lt; 10) extracted from the TNG50 cosmological simulation using a physically motivated analytic model for LyC escape. Results: Galaxies that have not experienced a merger for the last ~ 700 Myr have an average fesc ~ 3%, which increases to up to 14% immediately following a merger. The strongest effect can be observed in galaxies with stellar masses of ~ 1e7 Msun. We attribute the increase in the escape fraction to two main factors: (i) accretion of metal-poor gas onto the central region of a galaxy, which feeds star formation and LyC emission; and (ii) displacement of neutral gas relative to star-forming regions, which reduces the optical depth to LyC photons. We additionally examine how proximity to other galaxies influences LyC escape, finding that galaxies with more neighbors tend to have more frequent mergers, and thus a higher LyC leakage. However, galaxies in overdense regions tend to have a larger LyC escape fraction independently from mergers, because of their higher gas inflow, and consequent increase in the star formation rate. The increase in both mergers and gas inflow could contribute to low-mass galaxies ionizing proximity zones of high-z Ly-alpha leakers recently observed with JWST.</description>

      <title>Overdensity of Lyman-Break Galaxy Candidates Around Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), are a family of hyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. A number of studies have shown that these objects reside in significantly overdense regions of the Universe based on the identification of companions at optical through far-IR wavelengths. Here we present further characterization of their environments by studying the surface density of Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates in the vicinity of three Hot DOGs. For two of them, WISE J041010.60-091305.2 at z=3.631 and WISE J083153.25+014010.8 at z=3.912, we identify the candidate LBG companions using deep observations obtained with Baade/IMACS. For the third, WISE J224607.56-052634.9 at z=4.601, we re-analyse previously published data obtained with Gemini-S/GMOS-S. We optimise the LBG photometric selection criteria at the redshift of each target using the COSMOS2020 catalog. When comparing the density of LBG candidates found in the vicinity of these Hot DOGs with that in the COSMOS2020 catalog, we find overdensities of $\delta=1.83\pm 0.08$ ($\delta' = 7.49\pm 0.68$), $\delta=4.67\pm 0.21$ ($\delta' = 29.17\pm 2.21$), and $\delta = 2.36\pm 0.25$ ($\delta' = 11.60\pm 1.96$) around W0410-0913, W0831+0140, and W2246-0526, respectively, without (with) contamination correction. Additionally, we find that the overdensities are centrally concentrated around each Hot DOG. Our analysis also reveals that the overdensity of the fields surrounding W0410-0913 and W0831+0140 declines steeply beyond physical scales of $\sim$2 Mpc. If these overdensities evolve to clusters by z=0, these results suggest that the Hot DOG may correspond to the early formation stages of the brightest cluster galaxy. We were unable to determine if this is also the case for W2246-0526 due to the smaller field of view of the GMOS-S observations. Our results imply that Hot DOGs may be excellent tracers of protoclusters.</description>

      <title>Tracing cosmic gas in filaments and halos: Low-redshift insights from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we leverage CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and LSS data from the imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to study the distribution of gas around galaxy groups at low redshift, $z \approx 0.3$, via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. In particular, we perform velocity-weighted stacking on the photometric Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) to isolate the monopole and quadrupole of the kSZ signal, orienting the stacked images along 2D filaments identified using the Hessian of the projected gravitational potential. We find a 7.2$\sigma$ detection in the monopole of the signal (i.e., the gas density profile) and a 4$\sigma$ detection in the quadrupole ($m = 2$), constituting the first measurement of the alignment between gas distribution and the cosmic web through the kSZ effect. As it is a linear probe of the local gas density, the kSZ has heightened sensitivity to the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which is believed to house the majority of the ``missing baryons.'' Mapping out the gas density at low redshifts, as enabled by our measurements, is crucial for weak lensing surveys, for which the impact of baryons on small scales is a major impediment. We compare the anisotropic signal against two hydrodynamical simulations, TNG300-1 and Illustris, which have very different baryonic feedback prescriptions. We find that the anisotropic signal measured in the data is comparable but slightly larger and more extended compared with the simulations. This suggests that there is excess accretion and feedback taking place through the filaments, hinting at the possible presence of spin-filament alignment of the BGS objects.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model of Cosmic Ray Propagation and Radio Extreme Scattering Events from Intermittent Interstellar Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittent magnetic structures are a plausible candidate for explaining cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion rates derived from observed CR energy spectra. Independently, studies of extreme scattering events (ESEs) of radio quasars and pulsar scintillation have hinted that very straight, large-aspect-ratio, magnetic current sheets may be responsible for the localized large scattering of radio waves. The required shortest axis of the typical structures producing ESEs is of the same scale ($\sim$AU) as the gyroradii of $\sim$GeV CRs. In this paper, we propose that the same magnetic/density sheets can produce large scattering of both CRs and radio waves. We demonstrate that the geometry and volume filling factor of the sheets derived from quasar ESEs can explain the observed mean free path of GeV CRs without introducing free parameters. The model places constraints on the sheet geometry, such as straightness and large aspect ratio, and assumes the statistics of the sheets are similar throughout the Galactic volume. We, therefore, discuss observational tests of the sheet model, which includes observations of echoes in pulsars and fast radio bursts, gravitationally lensed quasars, the distribution of ESE durations, and spatial correlations between ESE events and rotation-measure fluctuations. Such tests will be enabled by upcoming wide-field radio instruments, including Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and Deep Synoptic Array 2000 Antennas (DSA-2000).</description>

      <title>Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a "magnifying glass", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the "mirror principle" induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12 M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.</description>

      <title>Weakness of X-rays and Variability in High-redshift AGNs with Super-Eddington Accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad-line emission in the early universe. Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidence of AGN activity -- such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability -- remains rarely detected. The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processes or environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts. In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae. Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formed through effective inverse Comptonization. This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistent with those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super-Eddington accreting AGNs. In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet exhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with $\lesssim 10^{7-8}~M_\odot$, which undergo rapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinematics of the ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF44 is primarily influenced by the presence of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we conduct a contrasting kinematic study of DF44 within the alternative modified gravity framework. In comparison to NFW DM, we test three alternative gravity models viz Milgromian dynamics (MOND), characterized by a known acceleration scale, a generic $f(R)$ model, assuming an expansion of the Ricci scalar, and a quantum gravity-inspired Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR), which involves the running of the gravitational coupling parameter $G$ with the Universe's energy scale. For each gravity model, we evaluate the velocity dispersion (VD) of the galaxy beyond the conventional radial isotropic assumption and extend to two anisotropy scenarios, i.e., constant and Osipkov-Merritt. Our results show that all three gravity models can provide consistent fits to the observed VD of DF44; however, only MOND and RGGR remain competitive with NFW DM. Interestingly, the constant anisotropy scenario in all the models is also found to be competitive with the complete isotropic assumption.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Isotope Ratios in Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Stars: A Correlation with Effective Temperature and Implications for White Dwarf Merger Outcomes</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are a class of supergiants with anomalous chemical compositions, suggesting that they are remnants of CO-He white dwarf (WD) mergers. This class comprises two spectroscopically similar subclasses - dusty R Coronae Borealis (RCB) and dustless Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars. Both subclasses have a stark overabundance of $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in their atmospheres, but spectroscopic differences between them remain poorly studied. We present high-resolution ($R \approx 75000$) K-band spectra of six RCB and six dLHdC stars, including four newly discovered dLHdC stars, making this the largest sample to date. We develop a semi-automated fitting routine to measure $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios for this sample, tripling the number of dLHdC stars with oxygen isotope ratios measured from high resolution spectra. All six dLHdC stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}&lt;1$, while the RCB stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}&gt;4$. Additionally, for the first time, we find a trend of decreasing $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios with increasing effective temperature for HdC stars, consistent with predictions of theoretical WD merger models. However, we note that current models overpredict the low $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios of dLHdC stars by two orders of magnitude. We also measure abundances of C, N, O, Fe, S, Si, Mg, Na, and Ca for these stars. We observe a correlation between the abundances of $^{14}\textrm{N}$ and $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in our sample, suggesting that a fixed fraction of the $^{14}\textrm{N}$ is converted to $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in these stars via $\alpha$-capture. Our results affirm the emerging picture that the mass ratio/total mass of the WD binary determine whether an RCB or dLHdC is formed post-merger.</description>

      <title>Jets are the most robust observable ingredient of common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I examine images of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) with observable post-common envelope evolution (CEE) binary central stars and find that jets are about 40 percent more common than dense equatorial outflows. Because, in some cases, energetic jets can compress an equatorial outflow and because fast jets might disperse early in the PN evolution and avoid detection, the CEE process is likelier to launch jets than to eject a dense equatorial outflow by a larger factor than 1.4. In most cases, the companion, mainly a main sequence star, launches the jets as it accretes mass from the envelope of the giant star. By CEE jets, I also refer to jets launched shortly before the onset of the CEE, likely a grazing envelope evolution phase, and shortly after the CEE. The jets and the accretion of mass by the companion before, during, and after the CEE affect envelope mass removal and the final orbital separation. Most numerical simulations of the CEE ignore jets, and those that include jets omit other processes. Despite the considerable progress in the last decade with tens of hydrodynamical simulations of the CEE, we are still far from correctly simulating the CEE. Including jets in simulations of the CEE requires heavy computer resources, but it must be the next step.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric molecular blobs shape up circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During their thermally pulsing phase, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars eject material that forms extended dusty envelopes. Visible polarimetric imaging found clumpy dust clouds within two stellar radii of several oxygen-rich stars. Inhomogeneous molecular gas has also been observed in multiple emission lines within several stellar radii of different oxygen rich stars, including W Hya and Mira. At the stellar surface level, infrared images have revealed intricate structures around the carbon semi-regular variable R Scl and in the S-type star $\pi^{\mathrm{1}}$ Gru. Infrared images have also shown clumpy dust structures within a few stellar radii of the prototypical carbon AGB star IRC+10216, and studies of the molecular gas distribution beyond the dust formation zone have also shown complex circumstellar structures. Because of the lack of sufficient spatial resolution, however, the distribution of molecular gas in the stellar atmosphere and the dust formation zone of AGB carbon stars is not known, nor is how it is subsequently expelled.
  Here we report observations with a resolution of one stellar radius of the recently formed dust and molecular gas in the atmosphere of IRC+10216. Lines of HCN, SiS, and SiC$_2$ appear at different radii and in different clumps, which we interpret as large convective cells in the photosphere, as seen in Betelgeuse. The convective cells coalesce with pulsation causing anisotropies that, together with companions, shape its circumstellar envelope.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength picture of the misaligned BL Lac object 3C 371</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BL Lac object 3C 371 is one of the targets that are regularly monitored by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration to study blazar variability on both short and long timescales. We aim to evaluate the long-term multiwavelength (MWL) behaviour of 3C 371, comparing it with the results derived for its optical emission in our previous study. For this, we make use of the multi-band campaigns organized by the WEBT Collaboration in optical and radio between January 2018 and December 2020, and of public data from Swift and Fermi satellites and the MOJAVE Very Large Interferometry programme. We evaluate the variability shown by the source in each band with the amplitude variability quantification, as well as possible interband correlation using the z-Discrete Correlation Function. We also present a deep analysis of the optical-UV, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectral variability. With the MOJAVE data we perform a kinematics analysis, looking for components propagating along the jet, calculating its kinematics parameters. This set of parameters is later used for the interpretation of the source MWL behaviour, modelling the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source with theoretical blazar emission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared spectroscopy of the LMC recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have obtained near-infrared ($0.80-2.45\mu$m) spectra of the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a on two occasions during its 2024 August eruption. This is the first near-infrared spectroscopy of an extragalactic nova. The initial spectrum, on day 8.48, caught the nova in the coronal phase, with the [SiX] $1.43\mu$m line being extremely strong. This line had a luminosity of $\sim95$L$_\odot$, and is clearly a very powerful coolant. Its presence, together with the absence of [SiIX] 1.56$\mu$m, implies a coronal temperature $\gtrsim3\times10^6$K, possibly amongst the highest recorded coronal temperature in a nova eruption. With the exception of the [SiX] line, the near-infrared spectra are remarkable for being devoid of metal lines. We suggest that this is due, in part, to the exceptionally high temperature of the coronal gas, causing ions, whose emission lines would normally appear in the near-infrared spectrum, to be collisionally ionised to higher stages.</description>

      <title>Optical constraints on the coldest metal-poor population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coldest metal-poor population made of T and Y dwarfs are archaeological tracers of our Galaxy because they are very old and have kept the pristine material. The optical properties of these objects are important to characterise their atmospheric properties. We aim at characterising further the optical properties of ultracool metal-poor population with deep far-red optical images and parallax determinations. We solve trigonometric parallaxes of five metal-poor T dwarf candidates using 2-year monitoring with Calar-Alto 3.5-m telescope. We obtain $z'$-band photometry for the other 12 metal-poor T dwarf candidates using the 10.4-m GTC, the 8.2-m VLT, and the DES, increasing the sample of T subdwarfs with optical photometry from 12 to 24. We report a 3-$\sigma$ limit for the Accident in five optical bands using the 10.4-m GTC. We confirm four T subdwarfs and the Accident as a Y subdwarf, and propose two more Y subdwarf candidates. We emphasise that the $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour combining with the $W1-W2$ colour could break the metallicity-temperature degeneracy for T and possibly for Y dwarfs. The $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour shifts redward when metallicity decreases for a certain temperature, which is not predicted by state-of-the-art ultracool models. The Accident has the reddest $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour among our sample. The $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour will be useful to search for other examples of this cold and old population in upcoming and existing deep optical and infrared large-area surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: We present an analysis of the Lyman continuum (LyC) escape fraction of high redshift galaxies using an analytic post-processing approach. Methods: We apply the model to 600,000 galaxies of the Illustris TNG50 simulation in the redshift range z = 5.2 - 20. Results: Our study reveals a bimodal nature of LyC escape, which is associated either to (a) high metallicity (1e-3.5 &lt; Z &lt; 1e-2), low mass (Mstar &lt; 1e7Msun) galaxies which due to their efficient cooling exhibiting extended star formation, with photons escaping primarily from the outer regions of the galactic plane (ext-mode), or (b) low metallicity (Z &lt; 1e-3), moderately massive galaxies (Mstar &lt; 1e8Msun) in which star-formation can only take place in small high density regions with localized LyC escape originating from these regions (loc-mode). While the loc-mode is present at all redshifts under investigation, the ext-mode becomes prominent in small galaxies at later cosmic times, once sufficient metal enrichment has occurred. Building on these findings, we develop an analytical fitting formula to determine the escape fraction of galaxies based on their stellar and gas mass, as well as redshift, providing a valuable subgrid modelling tool for future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observational advances have allowed the detection of galaxies, protoclusters, and galaxy clusters at higher and higher redshifts, opening a new view into extreme galaxy evolution. I present an argument that the high redshift, massive galaxies discovered over the last decade are really the most massive galaxies within protocluster-cores of galaxy clusters at $z\sim2$, and that they are the partial descendants of same galaxies discovered by JWST at $z\sim9$. To that end, I present $\textit{The Manhattan Suite}$, a set of $100$ high resolution zoom-in simulations of the most massive galaxy clusters, out to $9\,R_\mathrm{vir}$, selected at $z = 2$ from a ($1.5\,\mathrm{cGpc})^3$ parent volume, and simulated using the $\textit{Simba}$ model. Unlike other cluster suites, my selection at $z = 2$ ensures that these systems are biased in a similar fashion to observations, in that they should be the brightest and the most massive by construction at $z \gtrsim 2$. I show that my sample is able to reproduce extremely star-bursting protoclusters such as SPT2349-56, high redshift galaxy clusters XLSSC122 and JKCS0249, and the wealth of massive (sometimes quenched) galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ and up to $z \sim 9$. I argue that these systems are intimately linked, and represent the same evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>On the universality of star formation efficiency in galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations of an isolated disk dwarf galaxy with an explicit model for unresolved turbulence and turbulence-based star formation prescription. We examine the characteristic values of the star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$, and its variations with local environment properties, such as metallicity, UV flux, and surface density. We show that the star formation efficiency per free-fall time in $\approx 10$ pc star-forming regions of the simulated disks has values in the range $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}\approx 0.01-0.1$, similar to observational estimates, with no trend with metallicity and only a weak trend with the UV flux. Likewise, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ estimated using projected patches of 500 pc size does not vary with metallicity and shows only a weak trend with average UV flux and gas surface density. The characteristic values of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}\approx 0.01-0.1$ arise naturally in the simulations via the combined effect of dynamical gas compression and ensuing stellar feedback that injects thermal and turbulent energy. The compression and feedback regulate the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}$, in star-forming regions, limiting it to $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}\approx 3-10$. Turbulence plays an important role in the universality of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ because turbulent energy and its dissipation are not sensitive to metallicity and UV flux that affect thermal energy. Our results indicate that the universality of observational estimates of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ can be plausibly explained by the turbulence-driven and feedback-regulated properties of star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Reverberation mapping of high-mass and high-redshift quasars using gravitational time delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass estimates of black holes (BHs) in the centers of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) often rely on the radius-luminosity relation. However, this relation, usually probed by reverberation mapping (RM), is poorly constrained in the high-luminosity and high-redshift ends due to the very long expected RM lag times. Multiply imaged AGN may offer a unique opportunity to explore the radius-luminosity relation at these ends. In addition to comprising several magnified images enabling a more efficient light-curve sampling, the time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars can also aid in making such RM measurements feasible on reasonable timescales: If the strong-lensing time delay is, for example, of the order of the expected RM time lag, changes in the emission lines in the leading image can be observed around the same time as the changes in the continuum in the trailing image. In this work we probe the typical time-delay distribution in galaxy-cluster lenses and estimate the number of both high-mass ($\sim10^9-10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), and high-redshift ($z\gtrsim4-12$) quasars that are expected to be strongly lensed by clusters. We find that up to several dozen thousand M$_{BH}\sim10^{6}$-$10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ broad-line AGN at $z&gt;4$ should be multiply imaged by galaxy clusters and detectable with JWST, hundreds with Euclid and several thousands with the Roman Space Telescope, across the whole sky. These could supply an important calibration for the BH mass scaling in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of chaos in relativistic three-body problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical particle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\leq N\lesssim 10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms are included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a slightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda_{\rm max}$. In this work we explore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular configurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms aiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under the effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space dynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents, becomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order force derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique to compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent diagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in phase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the relativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ than its classical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However, the rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the classical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces chaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend, the dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the rescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical value.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ could induce possibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and possibly large $N$.</description>

      <title>Abundance ties: Nephele and the globular cluster population accreted with $\omega$ Cen. Based on APOGEE DR17 and Gaia EDR3</title>

Abstract: The peculiar Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri (NGC 5139) has drawn attention for its unique features - such as a high stellar mass and a broad distribution of chemical elements - that have led to the hypothesis that it might be the nuclear remnant of an ancient dwarf galaxy accreted by the Milky Way (MW), potentially bringing along its own globular cluster (GC) system. In this work, we adopt an innovative approach by examining the individual chemical abundances of Galactic GCs. Applying Gaussian Mixture Models to globular cluster stars, whose membership is based on Gaia EDR3, and whose chemical abundances are provided by APOGEE DR17, we depart from traditional kinematic-based procedures and search for GCs that are chemically compatible with $\omega$ Cen in a 8-dimensional space defined by [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [C/Fe], [Al/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Mn/Fe]. Our analysis leads to the identification of six GCs - NGC 6752, NGC 6656, NGC 6809, NGC 6273, NGC 6205, and NGC 6254 - that exhibit strong chemical similarities with $\omega$ Cen, and which have metallicities that coincide with those of the two main peaks of $\omega$ Cen's metallicity distribution. The chemical patterns of these clusters lead to the exclusion that they formed in progenitor galaxies with chemical enrichment histories similar to those of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, Sagittarius, and Fornax. Once placed in kinematic spaces such as the energy - angular momentum plane, these GCs result scattered across an extended region, which is predicted by N-body simulations if their common progenitor was sufficiently massive compared to the MW. Our novel approach suggests a common origin for NGC 6752, NGC 6656, NGC 6809, NGC 6273, NGC 6205, NGC 6254 and $\omega$ Cen, indicating that Nephele, as we propose to call the progenitor in which these GCs formed, played a substantial role in the Galaxy's history.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>

Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>IllustrisTNG Insights: Factors Affecting the Presence of Bars in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bars are important in the secular evolution of galaxies. This study is aimed at exploring the reasons why some galaxies have bars at redshift $z=0$ while others do not. We use ellipse fitting to measure the properties and evolution of bars in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. By using the K-S two-sample test and tracing their evolutionary changes, we analyze the parameter differences between barred and unbarred galaxies. The properties of galaxies with short bars are also studied. When tracing all disk galaxies at $z=0$ back to $z=1$, all of them show similar bar features at $z=1$. The fraction of bars increases in barred and short-bar galaxies but decreases in unbarred galaxies during $z=1-0$. In the case of disk galaxies with stellar mass log$(M_*/M_\odot)&gt; 10.8$, nurture (mainly mergers) plays the most important role in suppressing or destroying bars. Bars are more likely to endure in galaxies that experience fewer mergers, which can be quantified by smaller stellar halos and ex-situ mass fractions. Approximately 60\% of the unbarred galaxies in the local Universe once had a bar. In contrast, the lack of responsiveness to bar instabilities (a larger Toomre-Q parameter) due to a less compact nature plays an important role in generating unbarred disk galaxies with stellar mass log$(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;10.8$. Moreover, short bars generally form at a similar time to normal bars, during which they either grow mildly or contract significantly. The fact that IllustrisTNG simulations may produce too many short-bar galaxies indicates that the dynamical properties of the central regions in IllustrisTNG galaxies are less likely to be affected by external factors, such as mergers and gas inflows.</description>

      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass estimates of a spiral galaxy derived from its rotation curve must account for the galaxy's past accretion history. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>

      <title>Formation of Transitional cE/UCD Galaxies through Massive/Dwarf Disc Galaxy Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of the merger of a dwarf disc galaxy with a massive spiral galaxy of the Milky Way type have been studied in detail. The remnant of such interaction after numerous crossings of the satellite through the disc of the main galaxy is a compact stellar core, the characteristics of which are close to small compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) or large ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs). Such transitional cE/UCD objects with an effective radius of 100-200 pc arise as a result of stripping the outer layers of the stellar core during the destruction of a disc dwarf galaxy. Numerical models of the satellite before interaction include baryonic matter (stars and gas) and dark mass. We use N-body to describe the dynamics of stars and dark matter and Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics to model the gas components of both galaxies. The direct method of calculating the gravitational force between all particles provides a qualitative resolution of spatial structures up to 10 pc. The simulated cE/UCD galaxies contain very little gas and dark matter at the end of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Elevated UV luminosity density at Cosmic Dawn explained by non-evolving, weakly mass-dependent star formation efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered unexpectedly high cosmic star formation activity in the early Universe, mere hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. These observations are often understood to reflect an evolutionary shift in star formation efficiency (SFE) caused by changing galactic conditions during these early epochs. We present FIREbox-HR, a high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, which offers insights into the SFE of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic time. FIREbox-HR re-simulates the cosmic volume (L = 22.1 cMpc) of the original FIREbox run with eight times higher mass resolution (m_b ~ 7800 M_sun), but with identical physics, down to z ~ 6. FIREbox-HR predicts ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions in good agreement with available observational data. The simulation also successfully reproduces the observed cosmic UV luminosity density at z ~ 6 - 14, demonstrating that relatively high star formation activity in the early Universe is a natural outcome of the baryonic processes encoded in the FIRE-2 model. According to FIREbox-HR, the SFE - halo mass relation for intermediate mass halos (M_halo ~ 10^9 - 10^11 M_sun) does not significantly evolve with redshift and is only weakly mass-dependent. These properties of the SFE - halo mass relation lead to a larger contribution from lower mass halos at higher z, driving the gradual evolution of the observed cosmic UV luminosity density. A theoretical model based on the SFE - halo mass relation inferred from FIREbox-HR allows us to explore implications for galaxy evolution. Future observations of UV faint galaxies at z &gt; 12 will provide an opportunity to further test these predictions and deepen our understanding of star formation during Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Discovery Potential for Decaying Dark Matter and Faint X-ray Sources with XRISM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM's DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Masses of Supercluster-Scale Filaments from Redshift Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a strategy for estimating the mass per unit length along supercluster-scale filaments that are oriented across the sky, based on mock redshift surveys of 264 filaments from the Millennium simulation. In our fiducial scenario, we place each simulated filament at a distance of 300 Mpc, perpendicular to the line of sight, and calculate the redshift dispersion using galaxies with magnitudes r&lt;19.5. Some regions are dynamically complicated in ways that interfere with finding a simple relationship between dispersion sigma and linear mass density mu. However, by examining individual overlapping segments along the filaments, we find a relationship that allows us to successfully predict log(mu) from log(sigma) with a scatter of about +/- 0.20 dex, for ~ 70% of the regions along filaments. This relationship is robust to changes in the distance to the filament if the physical segment length and the absolute magnitude for galaxy selection are held constant. The relationship between redshift dispersion and mass is similar to that obtained for a simple analytical model where filaments are dynamically relaxed, and we examine the possibility that the galaxies are indeed relaxed within the gravitational potential of the filament. We find that this is not the case; galaxy dynamics are strongly effected by infall to the filament and by orbits within groups and clusters</description>

      <title>Measuring the Mean Free Path of HI Ionizing Photons at $3.2\leq z\leq4.6$ with DESI Y1 Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean free path of ionizing photons for neutral hydrogen ($\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$) is a crucial quantity in modelling the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the extragalactic ultraviolet background (EUVB), and is widely used in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and reionization. We construct the largest quasar spectrum dataset to date -- 12,595 $\mathrm{S/N}&gt;3$ spectra -- using the Y1 observation of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to make the most precise model-independent measurement of the mean free path at $3.2\leq z\leq 4.6$. By stacking the spectra in 17 redshift bins and modelling the Lyman continuum profile, we get a redshift evolution $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}\propto(1+z)^{-4.27}$ at $2\leq z\leq 5$, which is much shallower than previous estimates. We then explore the sources of systematic bias, including the choice of intrinsic quasar continuum, the consideration of Lyman series opacity and Lyman limit opacity evolution and the definition of $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$. Combining our results with estimates of $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ at higher redshifts, we conclude at high confidence that the evolution in $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ steepens at $z \approx 5$. We interpret this inflection as the transition from the end of HI reionization to a fully ionized plasma which characterizes the intergalactic medium of the past $\sim10$ billion years.</description>

      <title>Smart Kanata: A Framework for Autonomous Decision Making in Rapid Follow-up Observations of Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the early stages of transient events provides crucial information about the fundamental physical processes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, determining an appropriate observation mode immediately after the discovery of a new transient presents challenges due to significant uncertainties regarding its nature. We developed a framework designed for autonomous decision making in prompt follow-up observations of CVs using the Kanata 1.5-m telescope. The system, named Smart Kanata, first estimates the class probabilities of variable star types using a generative model. It then selects the optimal observation mode from three possible options based on the mutual information calculated from the class probabilities. We have operated the system for ~300 days and obtained 21 samples, among which automated observations were successfully performed for a nova and a microlensing event. In the time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we detected a rapid deepening of the absorption component of the H_alpha line. These initial results demonstrate the capability of Smart Kanata in facilitating rapid observations and improving our understanding of outbursts and eruptions of CVs and other galactic transients.</description>
