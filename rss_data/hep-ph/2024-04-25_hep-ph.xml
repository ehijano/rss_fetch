      <title>Probing conversion-driven freeze-out at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversion-driven freeze-out is an appealing mechanism to explain the observed relic density while naturally accommodating the null-results from direct and indirect detection due to a very weak dark matter coupling. Interestingly, the scenario predicts long-lived particles decaying into dark matter with lifetimes favorably coinciding with the range that can be resolved at the LHC. However, the small mass splitting between the long-lived particle and dark matter renders the decay products soft, challenging current search strategies. We consider four different classes of searches covering the entire range of lifetimes: heavy stable charge particles, disappearing tracks, displaced vertices, and missing energy searches. We discuss the applicability of these searches to conversion-driven freeze-out and derive current constraints highlighting their complementarity. For the displaced vertices search, we demonstrate how a slight modification of the current analysis significantly improves its sensitivity to the scenario.</description>

      <title>Resonant Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel reheating scenario proceeding through $s$-channel inflaton annihilation, mediated by a massive scalar. If the inflaton $\phi$ oscillates around the minimum of a monomial potential $\propto \phi^{n}$, we reveal the emergence of resonance phenomena originating from the dynamic evolution of the inflaton mass for $n&gt;2$. Consequently, a resonance appears in both the radiation and the temperature evolution during the reheating process. By solving the coupled Boltzmann equations, we present solutions for radiation and temperature. We find non-trivial temperature characteristics during reheating, depending on the value of $n$ and the masses of the inflaton and mediator. Some phenomenological aspects of the model are explored. As a concrete example, we show that the same mediator participates in the genesis of dark matter, modifying the standard freeze-in dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate that the resonant reheating scenario could be tested by next-generation low- and high-frequency gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>OmniLearn: A Method to Simultaneously Facilitate All Jet Physics Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has become an essential tool in jet physics. Due to their complex, high-dimensional nature, jets can be explored holistically by neural networks in ways that are not possible manually. However, innovations in all areas of jet physics are proceeding in parallel. We show that specially constructed machine learning models trained for a specific jet classification task can improve the accuracy, precision, or speed of all other jet physics tasks. This is demonstrated by training on a particular multiclass classification task and then using the learned representation for different classification tasks, for datasets with a different (full) detector simulation, for jets from a different collision system ($pp$ versus $ep$), for generative models, for likelihood ratio estimation, and for anomaly detection. Our OmniLearn approach is thus a foundation model and is made publicly available for use in any area where state-of-the-art precision is required for analyses involving jets and their substructure.</description>

      <title>Millicharged Condensates on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that long-ranged terrestrial electric fields can be used to exclude or discover ultralight bosonic particles with extremely small charge, beyond that probed by astrophysics. Bound condensates of scalar millicharged particles can be rapidly produced near electrostatic generators or in the atmosphere. If such particles directly couple to the photon, they quickly short out such electrical activity. Instead, for interactions mediated by a kinetically-mixed dark photon, the effects of this condensate are suppressed depending on the size of the kinetic mixing, but may still be directly detected with precision electromagnetic sensors. Analogous condensates can also develop in other theories involving new long-ranged forces, such as those coupled to baryon and lepton number.</description>

      <title>Foundations of automatic feature extraction at LHC--point clouds and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms will play a key role in the upcoming runs of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), helping bolster various fronts ranging from fast and accurate detector simulations to physics analysis probing possible deviations from the Standard Model. The game-changing feature of these new algorithms is the ability to extract relevant information from high-dimensional input spaces, often regarded as "replacing the expert" in designing physics-intuitive variables. While this may seem true at first glance, it is far from reality. Existing research shows that physics-inspired feature extractors have many advantages beyond improving the qualitative understanding of the extracted features. In this review, we systematically explore automatic feature extraction from a phenomenological viewpoint and the motivation for physics-inspired architectures. We also discuss how prior knowledge from physics results in the naturalness of the point cloud representation and discuss graph-based applications to LHC phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Standard Model vacuum with respect to vacuum tunneling to the Komatsu vacuum in the cMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of the Standard Model vacuum with respect to vacuum tunneling to the Komatsu vacuum, which exists when $m_L^2 + m_{H_u}^2&lt;0$, in the cMSSM. Employing the numerical tools \verb|SARAH|, \verb|SPheno| and \verb|CosmoTransitions|, we scan and constrain the parameter space of the cMSSM up to 10 TeV. Regions excluded due to having a vacuum tunneling half-life less than the age of the observable universe are concentrated near the regions where the Standard Model vacuum is tachyonic and are more stringent at smaller $m_0$, larger and negative $A_0$, and larger $\tan\beta$. New excluded regions, which satisfy $m_h \simeq 125 \text{GeV}$, are found.</description>

      <title>Low-mass dark sector searches with deuteron photodisintegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen much activity in searches for dark-sector messenger particles in the 10-100 MeV mass range, especially in view of a potential new light boson conjectured by the ATOMKI collaboration, X17. Under the assumption that the messenger particle has definite parity and either zero or unit spin, quite stringent bounds already exist on its coupling to electrons and protons. Equally stringent bounds on the neutron coupling do not exist yet, but are nonetheless desirable. We explore how measurements of deuteron photodisintegration with a quasi-free neutron can yield bounds on the neutron coupling, and compute projections for a potential measurement at the lowenergy high-intensity electron scattering experiment MAGIX@MESA. The projected bounds are found to be competitive for an axial-vector or pseudoscalar scenario, but not for a vector or scalar scenario.</description>

      <title>Gauged Q-ball dark matter through a cosmological first-order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a new type of dynamical dark matter mechanism, we discuss the stability of the gauged Q-ball dark matter and its production mechanism through a cosmological first-order phase transition. This work delves into the study of gauged Q-ball dark matter generated during the cosmic phase transition. We demonstrate detailed discussions on the stability of gauged Q-balls to rigorously constrain their charge and mass ranges. Additionally, employing analytic approximations and the mapping method, we provide qualitative insights of gauged Q-ball. We establish an upper limit on the gauge coupling constant and give the relic density of stable gauged Q-ball dark matter formed during a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, we discuss potential observational signatures or constraints of gauged Q-ball dark matter, including astronomical observations and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Lessons from ATLAS and CMS measurements of Higgs boson decays to second generation fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is now experimental evidence for Higgs boson decay into a pair of muons, and significant constraints on the Higgs boson decay into a charm quark-antiquark pair. The data on Higgs boson decays into second generation fermions probes various extensions of the Standard Model. We analyze the implications for the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), without and with minimal flavor violation (MFV), for two Higgs doublet models (2HDM) with natural flavor conservation (NFC), for models with vector-like fermions, and for specific models that predict significant modifications of the Yukawa couplings to the light generations.</description>

      <title>Probing the pole origin of $X(3872)$ with the coupled-channel dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $X(3872)$, as the first and the most crucial member in the exotic charmoniumlike $XYZ$ family, has been studied for a long time. However, its dynamical origin, whether stemming from a $D\bar{D}^*$ hadronic molecule or the first excited $P$-wave charmonium $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, remains controversial. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the $X(3872)$ definitely does not result from the mass shift of the higher bare $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ resonance pole in the coupled-channel dynamics involving a short-distance $c\bar{c}$ core and the long-distance $D\bar{D}^*$ channels. Instead, it originates from either the $D\bar{D}^*$ molecular pole or the shadow pole associated with the $P$-wave charmonium, which depends on the concrete coupling mode between the $c\bar{c}$ and $D\bar{D}^*$. In order to further exploit the nature of $X(3872)$, we carefully investigate potential mechanisms that contribute to its pole width, which suggests that the coupled-channel dynamics plays a critical role in causing a noticeable discrepancy between the pole widths of $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}^+$. Interestingly, we bridge the quantitative connection among the dynamics origin of $X(3872)$, its pole width and the properties of the predicted new resonance. The precise measurement of the pole width of $X(3872)$ and the search for the new charmoniumlike resonance become highly significant and can be anticipated in future LHCb, BESIII and Belle II experiments.</description>

      <title>A holographic bottom-up approach to $\Sigma$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the description of neutral $\Sigma$ baryons with $I(J^P)=1(1/2^+)$ and $I(J^P)=1(3/2^+)$ using two bottom-up approaches: the deformed background and the static dilaton. In both models, we consider a non-linear Regge trajectory extension motivated by the \emph{strange} nature that $\Sigma$ baryons have. We found that both models describe these systems with an RMS error smaller than 10 $\%$. We also perform a configurational entropy calculation in both models to discuss hadronic stability.</description>

      <title>Understanding small neutrino mass and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have derived previously the relations between the neutrino masses and mixing angles in a dispersive analysis on the mixing of neutral leptonic states. The only involved assumption is that the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) is restored at a high energy scale in some new physics scenario, which diminishes the box diagrams responsible for the mixing. Here we include corrections to the analysis up to three loops, arising from exchanges of additional neutral and charged scalars in the electroweak symmetric phase. The solution to the dispersion relation for the $\mu^-e^+$-$\mu^+e^-$ mixing generates a typical neutrino mass $m_\nu\sim O(1)$ eV in the SM unambiguously. The solution also favors the normal ordering of the neutrino masses over the inverted one, and links the large electroweak symmetry restoration, i.e., new physics scale to the small neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Black Hole Shadow with Dark Matter Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revolutionized our ability to study black holes by providing unprecedented spatial resolution and unveiling horizon-scale details. With advancements leading to the next-generation EHT, there is potential to probe even deeper into the black hole's dark region, especially the inner shadow characterized by low-intensity foreground emissions from the jet, thanks to a significant enhancement in dynamic range by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate how such enhanced observations could transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for detecting annihilating dark matter, which can form a dense profile in the vicinity of supermassive black holes, by examining the morphology of the black hole image.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study neutrino flavor evolution in the quantum many-body approach using the full neutrino-neutrino Hamiltonian, including the usually neglected terms that mediate non-forward scattering processes. Working in the occupation number representation with plane waves as single-particle states, we explore the time evolution of simple initial states with up to $N=10$ neutrinos. We discuss the time evolution of the Loschmidt echo, one body flavor and kinetic observables, and the one-body entanglement entropy. For the small systems considered, we observe `thermalization' of both flavor and momentum degrees of freedom on comparable time scales, with results converging towards expectation values computed within a microcanonical ensemble. We also observe that the inclusion of non-forward processes generates a faster flavor evolution compared to the one induced by the truncated (forward) Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Calculable neutrino Dirac mass matrix and one-loop $\bar \theta$ in the minimal left-right symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the contribution to the strong CP parameter $\bar \theta$ from leptonic CP violation at one-loop level in the minimal left-right symmetric model in the case of parity as the left-right symmetry. The Hermitian neutrino Dirac mass matrix $M_D$ can be calculated using the light and heavy neutrino masses and mixings. We propose a parameterization of the right-handed neutrino mixing matrix $V_R$ and construct the heavy neutrino mass that maintains the Hermiticity of $M_D$. We further apply it to evaluate the one-loop $\bar\theta$, denoted as $\bar \theta_{loop}$, as a function of the sterile neutrino masses for explicit examples of $V_R$. By requiring the magnitude of $\bar \theta_{loop}\lesssim 10^{-10}$, we derive the upper limits on the sterile neutrino masses, which are within reach of direct searches at the Large Hadron Collider and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. Furthermore, our parameterization is applicable to other phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>$R_{D^{(*)}}$ and survival of the fittest scalar leptoquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the long-standing discrepancy in lepton flavor universality ratios $R_D$ and $R_{D^{\ast}}$ we assess the status of scalar leptoquark states $R_2$, $\widetilde R_2$ and $S_1$ which can in principle provide a desired enhancement of $\mathcal{B}(B\to D^{(\ast )}\tau \nu)$ in a minimal setup with two Yukawa couplings only. We consider unavoidable low-energy constraints, $Z$-pole measurements as well as high-$p_T$ constraints. After setting mass of each leptoquark to $1.5$ TeV we find that of all considered states only $S_1$ leptoquark, coupled to both chiralities of leptons and quarks, is still a completely viable solution while the scenario with $R_2$ is in growing tension with $\Gamma(Z \to \tau \tau)$ and with the LHC constraints on the di-tau tails at high-$p_T$. We comment on the future experimental tests of $S_1$ scenario.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the relic abundance of dark matter in the presence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) beyond the semiclassical approximation. We take into account the quantum corrections due to the memory burden effect, which is assumed to suppress the black hole evaporation rate by the inverse power of its own entropy. Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections. Depending on the strength of the burden effect, we show that a wide range of parameter space opens up in the initial PBH mass and fundamental dark matter mass plane that respects the correct relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structure of the renormalization group in the renormalizable QFT theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the group formed by finite renormalizations as an infinite-dimensional Lie group. It is demonstrated that for the finite renormalization of the gauge coupling constant its generators $\hat L_n$ with $n\ge 1$ satisfy the commutation relations of the Witt algebra and, therefore, form its subalgebra. The commutation relations are also written for the more general case when finite renormalizations are made for both the coupling constant and matter fields. We also construct the generator of the Abelian subgroup corresponding to the changes of the renormalization scale. The explicit expressions for the renormalization group generators are written in the case when they act on the $\beta$-function and the anomalous dimension. It is explained how the finite changes of these functions under the finite renormalizations can be obtained with the help of the exponential map.</description>

      <title>Position-space renormalization schemes for four-quark operators in HQET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-space schemes are gauge-invariant, regulator-independent renormalization schemes that are defined by requiring position-space correlation functions of gauge invariant operators to be equal to their noninteracting values at particular kinematic points. These schemes can be used to nonperturbatively renormalize composite operators in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD), and by computing matching coefficients between the X-space scheme and MSbar in the dimensionally-regulated continuum, matrix elements calculated with LQCD can be converted to MSbar-renormalized matrix elements. Using X-space schemes for Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) operators has the additional benefit that appropriate ratios of position-space correlation functions cancel the power divergent static-quark self-energy of Lattice HQET nonperturbatively. This work presents the O($\alpha_S$) matching coefficients between X-space renormalized four-quark flavor-nonsinglet HQET operators relevant for the lifetimes of charm- and bottom-hadrons, and four-quark HQET operators relevant for mixing between neutral mesons containing a heavy quark, such as B-Bbar mixing.</description>

      <title>Confronting the Diversity Problem: The Limits of Galaxy Rotation Curves as a tool to Understand Dark Matter Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While galaxy rotation curves provide one of the most powerful methods for measuring dark matter profiles in the inner regions of rotation-supported galaxies, at the dwarf scale there are factors that can complicate this analysis. Given the expectation of a universal profile in dark matter-only simulations, the diversity of observed rotation curves has become an often-discussed issue in Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology on galactic scales. We analyze a suite of Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of $10^{10}-10^{12}$ $M_\odot$ halos with standard cold dark matter, and compare the true circular velocity to rotation curve reconstructions. We find that, for galaxies with well-ordered gaseous disks, the measured rotation curve may deviate from true circular velocity by at most 10% within the radius of the disk. However, non-equilibrium behavior, non-circular motions, and non-thermal and non-kinetic stresses may cause much larger discrepancies of 50% or more. Most rotation curve reconstructions underestimate the true circular velocity, while some reconstructions transiently over-estimate it in the central few kiloparsecs due to dynamical phenomena. We further demonstrate that the features that contribute to these failures are not always visibly obvious in HI observations. If such dwarf galaxies are included in galaxy catalogs, they may give rise to the appearance of "artificial" rotation curve diversity that does not reflect the true variation in underlying dark matter profiles.</description>

      <title>On standing wave in perturbed anti-de Sitter spacetimes with a naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of black hole perturbation theory, this work investigates the standing wave solutions in Reissner-Nordtsr\"om (RN) anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes with a naked singularity. These solutions can be viewed as a specific class of quasinormal modes exhibiting distinct characteristics. The imaginary parts of their frequencies are numerically vanishing, allowing them to persist over an extended period. Besides, these modes are predominantly stationary in terms of the evolution of spacetime waveforms. The numerical calculations are carried out employing the finite difference method, and the quasinormal frequencies extracted by the Prony method are shown to be consistent with those obtained using the matrix method. The obtained waveforms and quasinormal frequencies are shown to be drastically different from those of an extreme RN-AdS black hole. As the quasinormal modes are primarily dissipative, the non-dissipative standing waves are attributed to the nature that the singularity can neither be a sink nor a source of the gravitational system.</description>

      <title>Deci-Hz gravitational waves from the self-interacting axion cloud around the rotating stellar mass black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from condensates of ultra-light particles, such as axion, around rotating black holes are a promising probe to search for unknown physics. For this purpose, we need to characterize the signal to detect the gravitational waves, which requires tracking the evolution of the condensates, including various effects. The axion self-interaction causes the non-linear coupling between the superradiant modes, resulting in complicated branching of evolution. Most studies so far have considered evolution under the non-relativistic approximation or the two-mode approximation. In this paper, we numerically investigate the evolution of the axion condensate without these approximations, taking higher multipole modes into account. We also investigate the possible signature in gravitational waves from the condensate. We show that the higher multipole modes are excited, leading to the gravitational wave signal by the transition of the axion between different levels. The most prominent signal of gravitational waves arises from the transition between modes with their angular quantum numbers different by two. The gravitational wave signal is emitted in the deci-Hz band for stellar mass black holes, which might be observable with the future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of hadron interactions within lattice QCD has been facilitated by the well-known quantisation condition, linking scattering phase shifts to finite-volume energies. Additionally, the ability to utilise systems at finite total boosts has been pivotal in smoothly charting the energy-dependent behaviour of these phase shifts. The existing implementations of the quantization condition at finite boosts rely on momentum transformations between rest and moving frames, defined directly in terms of the energy eigenvalues. This energy dependence is unsuitable in the formulation of a Hamiltonian.In this work, we introduce a novel approach to generalise the three-momentum boost prescription, enabling the incorporation of energy-independent finite-volume Hamiltonians within moving frames. We demonstrate the application of our method through numerical comparisons, employing a phenomenological $\pi\pi$ scattering example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of stepped dark radiation have recently been found to have an important impact on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, aiding in easing the Hubble tension. In this work, we study models with a sector of dark radiation with a step in its abundance, which thermalizes after big bang nucleosynthesis by mixing with the standard model neutrinos. For this, we extend an earlier work which has focused on the background evolution only until the dark sector thermalizes by deriving the full background and perturbation equations of the model and implementing them in an Einstein-Boltzmann solving code. We expound on the behavior of this model, discussing the wide range of parameters that result in interesting and viable cosmologies that dynamically generate dark radiation during a range of epochs. We find that for the strongly self-coupled regime, there is no large cosmological impact for a tight prior on the mass, whereas larger mass ranges allow a smooth interpolation between a behavior close to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological standard model and close to an additional component of strongly self-interacting dark radiation. In the weakly self-coupled regime we find that we can accommodate a parameter space relevant for the neutrino anomalies as well as one relevant to easing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Constraints on U(1)' Models: from Non-Standard Interactions to Long-Range Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.14220v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of gauge bosons from a weakly coupled lepton flavor dependent $U(1)'$ interaction on the matter background in the evolution of solar, atmospheric, reactor and long-baseline accelerator neutrinos in the global analysis of oscillation data. The analysis is performed for interaction lengths ranging from the Sun-Earth distance to effective contact neutrino interactions. We survey $\sim 10000$ set of models characterized by the six relevant fermion $U(1)'$ charges and find that in all cases, constraints on the coupling and mass of the $Z'$ can be derived. We also find that about 5% of the $U(1)'$ model charges lead to a viable LMA-D solution but this is only possible in the contact interaction limit. We explicitly quantify the constraints for a variety of models including $U(1)_{B-3L_e}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{B-\frac{3}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{L_e-\frac{1}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$. We compare the constraints imposed by our oscillation analysis with the strongest bounds from fifth force searches, violation of equivalence principle as well as bounds from scattering experiments and white dwarf cooling. Our results show that generically, the oscillation analysis improves over the existing bounds from gravity tests for $Z'$ lighter than $\sim 10^{-11}$ eV. In the contact interaction limit, we find that for most models listed above there are values of $g'$ and $M_{Z'}$ for which the oscillation analysis provides constraints beyond those imposed by laboratory experiments. Finally we illustrate the range of $Z'$ and couplings leading to a viable LMA-D solution for two sets of models.</description>

      <title>Neutrino model with broken $\mu -\tau $ Symmetry and Unflavored Leptogenesis with Dihedral Flavor Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new neutrino flavor model based on a $D_{4}\times U(1)$ flavor symmetry providing predictions for neutrino masses and mixing along with a successful generation of the observed Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU). After the spontaneous breaking of the flavor symmetry, the type I seesaw mechanism leads to a light neutrino mass matrix with broken $\mu-\tau $ symmetry. By performing a numerical analysis, we find that the model favors a normal mass hierarchy with the lightest neutrino mass lies in the range $m_{1}\in \lbrack 2.516,21.351]$ m$\mathrm{eV}$. The phenomenological implications of the neutrino sector are explored in detail and the results are discussed. Moreover, the generation of BAU is addressed via the leptogenesis mechanism from the decay of three right-handed neutrinos $N_{i}$. Through analytical and numerical analysis of the baryon asymmetry parameter $Y_{B}$, a successful unflavored leptogenesis takes place within the allowed parameter space obtained from neutrino phenomenology. We also examine interesting correlations between $Y_{B}$ and low energy observables and provide a comprehensive discussion of the results.</description>

Abstract: The detection of a heavy neutral CP-even Higgs boson of the $B-L$ Supersymmetric Standard Model (BLSSM), $h'$, with $m_{h'}\simeq 400~\text{GeV}$, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=14~\text{TeV}$, is investigated. The following production and decay channels are considered: $gg\to h'\to{ZZ}\to4\ell$ and $gg\to h'\to{W^+W^-}\to2\ell+\slashed{E}_T$ (with $\slashed{E}_T$ being the Missing~Transverse~Energy~(MET)), where $\ell=e,\mu$, with integrated luminosity $L_{\text{int}}=300~{\text{fb}}^{-1}$ (Run 3). Furthermore, we also look into the di-Higgs channel $gg\to h'\to{hh}\to{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}$ at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) with an integrated luminosity of $L_{\text{int}}=3000~{\text{fb}}^{-1}$. We demonstrate that promising signals with high statistical significance can be obtained through the three aforementioned channels.</description>

      <title>Fast Exact Algorithm for Neutrino Oscillation in Constant Matter Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently published method for solving the neutrino evolution equation with constant matter density is further refined and used to lay out an exact algorithm for computing oscillation probabilities, which is moderately faster than previous methods when looping through neutrinos of different energies. In particular, the three examples of $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival, $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_\mu$ survival and $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ appearance probabilities are written in terms of mixing angles, mass differences and matter electron density. A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities. For instance, the $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival probability in constant matter density is found to have no dependence on the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ or the CP-violating phase $\delta_{13}$.</description>

Abstract: The program AutoEFT is described. It allows one to generate Effective Field Theories (EFTs) from a given set of fields and symmetries. Allowed fields include scalars, spinors, gauge bosons, and gravitons. The symmetries can be local or global Lie groups based on U(1) and SU(N). The mass dimension of the EFT is limited only by the available computing resources. The operators are stored in a compact, human and machine-readable format. Aside from the program itself, we provide input files for EFTs based on the Standard Model and a number of its extensions. These include additional particles and symmetries, EFTs with minimal flavor violation, and gravitons.</description>

      <title>Relativistic description of asymmetric fully heavy tetraquarks in the diquark-antidiquark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masses of the ground, orbitally and radially excited states of the asymmetric fully heavy tetraquarks, composed of charm (c) and bottom (b) quarks and antiquarks are calculated in the relativistic diquark-antidiquark picture. The relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach and quantum chromodynamics is used to construct the quasipotentials of the quark-quark and diquark-antidiquark interactions. These quasipotentials consist of the short-range one-gluon exchange and long-distance linear confinement interactions. Relativistic effects are consistently taken into account. A tetraquark is considered as a bound state of a diquark and an antidiquark which are treated as a spatially extended colored objects and interact as a whole. It is shown that most of the investigated tetraquarks states (including all ground states) lie above the fall-apart strong decay thresholds into a meson pair. As a result they can be observed as wide resonances. Nevertheless, several orbitally excited states lie slightly above or even below these fall-apart thresholds, thus they could be narrow states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new way to interpret Top Standard Model measurements going beyond the SMEFT framework. Instead of the usual paradigm in Top EFT, where the main effects come from tails in momenta distributions, we propose an interpretation in terms of new physics which only shows up at loop-level. The effects of these new states, which can be lighter than required within the SMEFT, appear as distinctive structures at high momenta, but may be suppressed at the tails of distributions. As an illustration of this phenomena, we present the explicit case of a UV model with a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, including a Dark Matter candidate and a top-partner. This simple UV model reproduces the main features of this class of signatures, particularly a momentum-dependent form factor with more structure than the SMEFT. As the new states can be lighter than in SMEFT, we explore the interplay between the reinterpretation of direct searches for colored states and Dark Matter, and Top measurements made by ATLAS and CMS in the differential $t \bar t$ final state. We also compare our method with what one would expect using the SMEFT reinterpretation, finding that using the full loop information provides a better discriminating power.</description>

Prompted by this exciting result, we explore the viability of a simple interpretation and determine the required parameters. We also embed these models within a 3-3-1 gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM), showing that the $g_{\mu}-2$ anomaly can be accommodated in agreement with current data. We also show how our theory can be tested at high-energy colliders such as HL-LHC and FCC-hh.</description>

      <title>Resonant leptogenesis in minimal inverse seesaw ISS(2,2) model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the parameter space of the minimal inverse seesaw ISS(2,2) model for successful leptogenesis. The framework of ISS(2, 2) is realized by augmenting the Standard Model with two right-handed and two Standard Model singlet neutrinos. The decay of the heavy sterile states which is essentially an admixture of the right-handed and SM singlet neutrino states produces the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In this predictive model of leptogenesis, we study resonant leptogenesis where the mass splitting between the heavy sterile states is naturally achieved. We review the possibility of generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis where the CP violation comes solely from the low-energy CP phases. In addition, we study the effect of texture zero in the Dirac mass matrix on the parameter space of the model for successful resonant leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Consistent, multidimensional differential histogramming and summary statistics with YODA 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Histogramming is often taken for granted, but the power and compactness of partially aggregated, multidimensional summary statistics, and their fundamental connection to differential and integral calculus make them formidable statistical objects, especially when very large data volumes are involved. But expressing these concepts robustly and efficiently in high-dimensional parameter spaces and for large data samples is a highly non-trivial challenge -- doubly so if the resulting library is to remain usable by scientists as opposed to software engineers. In this paper we summarise the core principles required for consistent generalised histogramming, and use them to motivate the design principles and implementation mechanics of the re-engineered YODA histogramming library, a key component of physics data-model comparison and statistical interpretation in collider physics.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytic calculation of the one-loop correction to the double-real emission contribution to the zero-jettiness soft function at N3LO in QCD, accounting for both gluon-gluon and quark-antiquark soft final-state partons. We explain all the relevant steps of the computation including the reduction of phase-space integrals to master integrals in the presence of Heaviside functions, and the methods we employed to compute them.</description>

      <title>Examination of $k_t$-factorization in a Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the upper limit, $k_{\text{max}}$, of the transverse-momentum integration performed in the $k_t$-factorization formula. Based on explicit calculations in the Yukawa theory and the study of seminal papers, we argue that $k_{\text{max}}$ is equal to the factorization scale $\mu_F$ used to factorize the cross section into an off-shell hard coefficient and a universal factor. There is consequently a relation between $k_{\text{max}}$ and the definition of unintegrated parton densities (UPDFs). The use of an inconsistent relation leads potentially to the overestimation of the cross section, which has been observed, e.g., in D-meson production. One of our conclusions is that UPDFs related to collinear PDFs by an integration up to $\mu\sim Q$, where $Q$ is the hard scale and $\mu$ the scale in the collinear PDFs, imply that $k_{\text{max}}^2 \sim Q^2$. Integrating the transverse-momentum significantly above may result in the overestimation of the cross section. On the opposite, for UPDFs related to the collinear ones by an integration of the transverse momentum up to infinity, any $k_{\text{max}}^2 &gt; Q^2$ is fine.</description>

      <title>New Physics couplings from angular coefficient functions of $\bar B \to D^* (D \pi) \ell \bar \nu_\ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle Collaboration has recently measured the complete set of angular coefficient functions for the exclusive decays $\bar B \to D^* (D \pi) \ell \bar \nu_\ell$, with $\ell=e,\,\mu$, in four bins of the parameter $w=\displaystyle\frac{m_B^2+m_{D^*}^2-q^2}{2m_B m_{D^*}}$, with $q$ the lepton pair momentum. Under the assumption that physics beyond the Standard Model does not contribute to such modes, the measurements are useful to determine the hadronic form factors describing the $B \to D^*$ matrix elements of the Standard Model weak current, and to improve the determination of $|V_{cb}|$. On the other hand, they can be used to assess the impact of possible new physics contributions. In a bottom-up approach, we extend the Standard Model effective Hamiltonian governing this mode with the inclusion of the full set of Lorentz invariant d=6 operators compatible with the gauge symmetry of the theory. The measured angular coefficient functions can tightly constrain the couplings in the generalized Hamiltonian. We present the first results of this analysis, discussing how improvements can be achieved when more complete data on the angular coefficient functions will be available.</description>

      <title>Gauge and Scalar Boson Mediated Proton Decay in a Predictive SU(5) GUT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess proton decay signatures in the simplest viable $SU(5)$ model with regard to constraints on parameters governing the Standard Model fermion mass spectrum. Experimental signals for all eight two-body proton decay processes result from exchange of two gauge bosons, a single scalar leptoquark, or their combination. Consequently, it enables us to delve into an in-depth anatomy of proton decay modes and anticipate future signatures. Our findings dictate that observing a proton decay into $p\to\pi^0e^+$ indicates gauge boson mediation, with the potential for observation of $p\to\eta^0e^+$ mode. Alternatively, if decay is through $p\to K^+\overline\nu$ process, it is mediated by a scalar leptoquark, possibly allowing the observation of $p\to\pi^0\mu^+$. Detection of both $p\to\pi^0 e^+$ and $p\to K^+\overline\nu$ could enhance $p\to\pi^0\mu^+$ through constructive interference. The model predicts inaccessibility of $p\to\pi^+\overline\nu$, $p\to\eta^0\mu^+$, $p\to K^0e^+$, and $p\to K^0\mu^+$, regardless of the dominant mediation type, in the coming decades. In summary, through a comprehensive analysis of proton decay signals, gauge coupling unification, and fermion masses and mixing, we precisely constrain the parameter space of the $SU(5)$ model in question.</description>

      <title>QCD parameters and SM-high precision from $e^+e^-$ to Hadrons: Updated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13983v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1. I update my previous comparison of the theoretical value of the muon anomaly with the new measurement and found $\Delta a_\mu\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_\mu^{th} = (143\pm 42_{th}\pm 22_{exp})\times 10^{-11}$ which is about 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the SM predictions and experiment. 2. I improve the estimate of QCD power corrections up to dimension D=12 and provide a new estimate of the ones up to D=20 within the SVZ expansion by combining the ratio of the Laplace sum rules (LSR) with the BNP $\tau$-like decay moments for the I=1 vector current. The results in Table 1 confirm a violation of the factorization of the four-quark condensates and the value of the gluon one $ &lt;\alpha_s G^2&gt;$ from some other sources. Up to D=20, I there is not any factorial nor exponential growth of the size of these power corrections. 3. I use these new values of power corrections to extract $\alpha_s$ from the BNP lowest moment. To order $\alpha_s^4$, I find within the SVZ expansion: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)= 0.3081(50)_{fit}(71)_{\alpha_s^5}$ [resp. $0.3260 (47)_{fit}(62)_{\alpha_s^5}]$ implying $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1170(6)(3)_{evol}$ [resp. $0.1192(6)(3)_{evol}$] for Fixed Order (FO) [resp. Contour Improved (CI)] PT series. They lead to the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{SVZ}=0.3179(58)_{fit}(81)_{syst}$ and $ \alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{SVZ}= 0.1182(12)(3)_{evol}$ where the systematic error(syst) takes into account the discrepancy between FO and CI. Using the lowest BNP moment, we also obtain from the vector (V) component of $\tau$-decay the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{\tau,V}=0.3219(52)(91)_{syst}$ giving: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{\tau,V}=0.1187(13)(3)_{evol}$. The average of the two determinations leads to: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3198(72)$ and $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1185(9)(3)_{evol}$. 4. Some contributions beyond the SVZ expansion ($1/Q^2$, instantons and duality violation) expected to be small are discussed in Sections 10,11.</description>

Abstract: Interactions of charged leptons with nuclei and the naive tree-level kinematics of these processes are affected by radiation of photons induced by the QED nuclear medium. We evaluate cross-section modifications at leading orders of the number of correlated interactions inside the nucleus, known as the opacity expansion. We derive results for soft and collinear types of the bremsstrahlung at the first three orders in opacity and generalize them to higher orders. We present the leading in opacity energy spectra of soft and collinear photons and radiative energy loss inside the nucleus for experiments with lepton kinematics in the GeV energy range. At leading power of the Glauber soft-collinear effective field theory, the soft radiation is further resummed to all orders both in opacity and in the electromagnetic coupling constant. We find that the soft and collinear medium-induced radiation is vacuumlike, and additional corrections are power suppressed. Despite the negligible modification to the induced photon spectra, the nuclear medium-induced radiation sizably affects the broadening of charged leptons in the direction orthogonal to their propagation.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have studied the Vector Scotogenic Model in the context of the Dark Matter problem. Due to unitarity considerations, we have focused on the scenario with fermion dark matter, finding out that co-annihilations play a fundamental role in achieving dark matter relic abundance. Moreover, the coannihilation effects allow to separate the parameter space into two regions with different phenomenology. In addition, we have studied the detection prospects of these regions separately, considering indirect detection and production of these particles at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Transverse Momentum-Dependent Heavy-Quark Fragmentation at Next-to-Leading Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse momentum-dependent fragmentation functions (TMD FFs) of heavy (bottom and charm) quarks, which we recently introduced, are universal building blocks that enter predictions for a large number of observables involving final-state heavy quarks or hadrons. They enable the extension of fixed-order subtraction schemes to quasi-collinear limits, and are of particular interest in their own right as probes of the nonperturbative dynamics of hadronization. In this paper we calculate all TMD FFs involving heavy quarks and the associated TMD matrix element in heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) to next-to-leading order in the strong interaction. Our results confirm the renormalization properties, large-mass, and small-mass consistency relations predicted in our earlier work. We also derive and confirm a prediction for the large-$z$ behavior of the heavy-quark TMD FF by extending, for the first time, the formalism of joint resummation to capture quark mass effects in heavy-quark fragmentation. Our final results in position space agree with those of a recent calculation by another group that used a highly orthogonal organization of singularities in the intermediate momentum-space steps, providing a strong independent cross check. As an immediate application, we present the complete quark mass dependence of the energy-energy correlator (EEC) in the back-to-back limit at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$.</description>

Abstract: The MUonE experiment has been proposed to measure the differential cross section of $\mu e$ elastic scattering, by colliding the 160 GeV muons of the CERN M2 beam with atomic electrons of thin target plates. From a very precise measurement of the shape one can achieve a competitive determination of the leading hadronic contribution to the muon magnetic moment, independent from the other existing ones. In preparation for the Test Run with a reduced setup the detector geometry has been optimised. Expected yields for a first physics run with limited statistics are discussed, together with prospects for the assessment of the main systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>FRB dark sirens: Measuring the Hubble constant with unlocalized fast radio bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be used to measure cosmological parameters by employing the Macquart relation. However, at present, only a small number of FRB events are localized to host galaxies with known redshifts. Inspired by the dark siren method in gravitational wave cosmology, we develop a Bayesian method to statistically measure the Hubble constant using unlocalized FRBs and galaxy catalog data, which makes it possible to constrain cosmological parameters from a large number of FRB data without known redshifts, meanwhile including the real galaxy information. We assume that the probability for a galaxy to host an FRB is proportional to the luminosity of this galaxy and use the results from the IllustrisTNG simulation as the priors of FRB host galaxy parameters. Ignoring some systematic errors, we obtain the first statistical $H_0$ measurement only using twelve unlocalized FRB events combined with the big bang nucleosynthesis result, i.e., $H_0=80.4^{+24.1}_{-19.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, ($68\%$ highest-density interval). This method can also be refined to constrain other cosmological and FRB parameters. It is applicable to well-localized FRBs that still have several potential hosts.</description>

      <title>Thermalization at the femtoscale seen in high-energy Pb+Pb collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A collision between two atomic nuclei accelerated at a speed close to that of light creates a dense system of quarks and gluons. Interactions among them are so strong that they behave collectively like a droplet of fluid of ten-femtometer size, which expands into the vacuum and eventually fragments into thousands of particles. We report a new manifestation of thermalization in recent data from the Large Hadron Collider. Our analysis is based on results from the ATLAS Collaboration, which has measured the variance of the momentum per particle across Pb+Pb collision events with the same particle multiplicity. This variance decreases steeply over a narrow multiplicity range corresponding to central collisions. We provide a simple explanation of this newly-observed phenomenon: For a given multiplicity, the momentum per particle increases with increasing impact parameter. Since a larger impact parameter goes along with a smaller collision volume, this in turn implies that the momentum per particle increases as a function of density, which is a generic consequence of thermalization. Our analysis provides the first direct evidence of this phenomenon at the femtoscale.</description>

Abstract: A Hubble-induced phase transition is a natural spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism allowing for explosive particle production in non-oscillatory models of inflation involving non-minimally coupled spectator fields. In this work, we perform a comprehensive characterisation of this type of transitions as a tachyonic Ricci-heating mechanism, significantly extending previous results in the literature. By performing $\mathcal{O}(100)$ 3+1-dimensional classical lattice simulations, we explore the parameter space of two exemplary scenarios, numerically determining the main timescales in the process. Based on these results, we formulate a set of parametric equations that offer a practical approach for determining the efficiency of the heating process, the temperature at the onset of radiation domination, and the minimum number of e-folds of inflation needed to resolve the flatness and horizon problems in specific quintessential inflation scenarios. These parametric equations eliminate the need for additional lattice simulations, providing a convenient and efficient method for evaluating these key quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, for the first time in literature, we compare the predictions of non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg potentials in the $n_s-r$ plane against the constraints from the latest cosmological data in an extended $\Lambda$CDM model where we include non-standard self-interactions among massive neutrinos, mediated by a heavy scalar or vector boson. For the inflationary potentials, we consider two different formulations in gravity that are non-minimally coupled to the scalar field of the inflaton: \textit{Metric and Palatini.} We only consider the self-interaction to be present among $\tau$-neutrinos and only at moderate strengths. This is because strong interactions among $\tau$-neutrinos, or any strength self-interaction among electron- and muon-neutrinos, as well as any strength flavor-universal interactions, are strongly disfavoured from particle physics experiments.
  In terms of cosmological data, we use the latest public CMB datasets from Planck and BICEP/Keck collaborations, along with other data from CMB lensing, BAO, RSD, and SNe Ia luminosity distance measurements. We find that there are some situations where predictions from the inflationary models are ruled out at more than 2$\sigma$ by the minimal $\Lambda$CDM$+r$ model, but they are allowed in the self-interacting neutrino scenario.</description>

      <title>Induced Circular Polarization on Photons Due to Interaction with Axion-Like Particles in Rotating Magnetic Field of Neutron Stars</title>

Abstract: We investigate how the photon polarization is affected by the interaction with axion-like particles (ALPs) in the rotating magnetic field of a neutron star (NS). Using quantum Boltzmann equations the study demonstrates that the periodic magnetic field of millisecond NSs enhances the interaction of photons with ALPs and creates a circular polarization on them. A binary system including an NS and a companion star could serve as a probe. When the NS is in front of the companion star with respect to the earth observer, there is a circular polarization on the previously linearly polarized photons as a result of the interaction with ALPs there. After a half-binary period, the companion star passes in front of the NS, and the circular polarization of photons disappears and changes to linear. The excluded parameter space for a millisecond NS with 300~Hz rotating frequency, highlights the coupling constant of $1.7\times10^{-11}~\text{GeV}^{-1}\leq g_{a\gamma\gamma}\leq1.6\times10^{-3}~\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP masses in the range of $7\times10^{-12}~\text{eV}\leq m_a\leq1.5\times 10^{3}~\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Neutron star kick driven by asymmetric fast-neutrino flavor conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) leads to asymmetric matter ejection and neutrino emission, that potentially accounts for the origin of neutron star (NS) kick. Asymmetric neutrino radiation fields are, in general, accompanied by large-scale inhomogeneous fluid distributions, in particular for electron-fraction ($Y_e$) distributions. Recently, it has also been revealed that lower $Y_e$ environments in proto-neutron star envelope can offer preferable conditions for collective neutrino oscillations. In this paper, we show that a dipole asymmetry of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC), one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes, can power a NS kick, and that it would generate a characteristic correlation between asymmetric distributions of heavy elements in the ejecta and the direction of NS kick. We strengthen our argument for the FFC-driven NS kick mechanism by performing axisymmetric neutrino transport simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We show that this mechanism can generate sufficient linear momentum of neutrinos to account for typical proper motions of NS. Although more detailed studies are necessary, the present study opens a new channel to give a natal NS kick.</description>
