      <title>Differentially-Private Decentralized Learning in Heterogeneous Multicast Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a power-controlled differentially private decentralized learning algorithm designed for a set of clients aiming to collaboratively train a common learning model. The network is characterized by a row-stochastic adjacency matrix, which reflects different channel gains between the clients. In our privacy-preserving approach, both the transmit power for model updates and the level of injected Gaussian noise are jointly controlled to satisfy a given privacy and energy budget. We show that our proposed algorithm achieves a convergence rate of O(log T), where T is the horizon bound in the regret function. Furthermore, our numerical results confirm that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing works.</description>

      <title>Dual and Covering Radii of Extended Algebraic Geometry Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many literatures consider the extended Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, including their dual codes and covering radii, but few focus on extended algebraic geometry (AG) codes of genus $g\ge1$. In this paper, we investigate extended AG codes and Roth-Lempel type AG codes, including their dual codes and minimum distances. Moreover, we show that for certain $g$, the length of a $g$-MDS code over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ can attain $q+1+2g\sqrt{q}$, which is achieved by an extended AG code from the maximal curves of genus $g$. Notably, for some small finite fields, this length $q+1+2g\sqrt{q}$ is the largest among all known $g$-MDS codes. Subsequently, we establish that the covering radius of an $[n,k]$ extended AG code has $g+2$ possible values. For the case of $g=1$, we prove that this range reduces to two possible values when the length $n$ is sufficiently large, or when there exists an $[n,k+1]$ MDS elliptic code.</description>

      <title>Radio-PPG: photoplethysmogram digital twin synthesis using deep neural representation of 6G/WiFi ISAC signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins for 1D bio-signals enable real-time monitoring of physiological processes of a person, which enables early disease diagnosis and personalized treatment. This work introduces a novel non-contact method for digital twin (DT) photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal synthesis under the umbrella of 6G/WiFi integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We employ a software-defined radio (SDR) operating at 5.23 GHz that illuminates the chest of a nearby person with a wideband 6G/WiFi signal and collects the reflected signals. This allows us to acquire Radio-PPG dataset that consists of 300 minutes worth of near synchronous 64-channel radio data, PPG data, along with the labels (three body vitals) of 30 healthy subjects. With this, we test two artificial intelligence (AI) models for DT-PPG signal synthesis: i) discrete cosine transform followed by a multi-layer perceptron, ii) two U-NET models (Approximation network, Refinement network) in cascade, along with a custom loss function. Experimental results indicate that U-NET model achieves an impressive relative mean absolute error of 0.194 with a small ISAC sensing overhead of 15.62%, for DT-PPG synthesis. Furthermore, we performed quality assessment of the synthetic DT-PPG by computing the accuracy of DT-PPG-based vitals estimation and feature extraction, which turned out to be at par with that of reference PPG-based vitals estimation and feature extraction. This work highlights the potential of generative AI and 6G/WiFi ISAC technologies and serves as a foundational step towards the development of non-contact screening tools for covid-19, cardiovascular diseases and well-being assessment of people with special needs.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Fluid Antenna Systems for Multi-Target Wireless Sensing over LAWCNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) is emerging as a key technology for enhancing spatial flexibility and sensing accuracy in future wireless systems. This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled FAS for multi-target wireless sensing in low-altitude wireless consumer networks (LAWCNs) for achieving the low-altitude economy (LAE) missions. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the average Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for multiple target estimations. To tackle this non-convex problem, an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed, which jointly optimizes the UAV trajectory, the antenna position of the transmit fluid antennas (FAs) and the receive FAs, and the transmit beamforming at the UAV. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements in estimation accuracy and sensing reliability compared to conventional schemes, e.g., the fixed position antenna scheme. The proposed system achieves enhanced sensing performance through adaptive trajectory design and beamforming, alongside effective interference suppression via the flexible FAS antenna repositioning, underscoring its practical potential for precision sensing in the UAV-enabled LAWCNs.</description>

      <title>Large AI Model-Enabled Generative Semantic Communications for Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions, which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its effectiveness for image transmission tasks.</description>

      <title>New Algorithmic Directions in Optimal Transport and Applications for Product Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal transport between two high-dimensional distributions $\mu,\nu$ in $R^n$ from an algorithmic perspective: given $x \sim \mu$, find a close $y \sim \nu$ in $poly(n)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of $x,y$. Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation size of $\mu,\nu$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any product distribution $\mu$ to any $\nu$ with cost $\Delta + \delta$ under $\ell_p^p$, where $\Delta$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $\delta$ is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $\nu$ to be "sequentially samplable" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural notion.
  We further prove:
  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the standard Gaussian $\Phi^n$ to arbitrary $\nu$ under squared Euclidean cost. For $\nu = \Phi^n$ conditioned on a set $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$, we construct the sequential sampler in expected time $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ using membership oracle access to $\mathcal{S}$. This yields an algorithmic transport from $\Phi^n$ to $\Phi^n|\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time and expected squared distance $O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$, optimal for general $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$.
  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure $\varepsilon$, most $\Phi^n$ samples can be mapped to $\mathcal{S}$ within distance $O(\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the Whitney function of a representable q-matroid and the collection of all higher weight enumerators of any representing rank-metric code determine each other via a monomial substitution. Moreover, the q-matroid itself and the collection of all higher support enumerators of the code determine each other. Next, it is proven that the Whitney function of a q-matroid and the Whitney function of its projectivization determine each other via a monomial substitution. Finally, q-matroids with isomorphic projectivizations are studied. It is shown that the projectivizations are isomorphic iff the q-matroids admit a dimension-preserving lattice isomorphism between their lattices of flats. Such q-matroids are called weakly isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Average relative entropy of random states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a cornerstone concept in quantum information theory. In this work, we study relative entropy of random states from major generic state models of Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures-Hall ensembles. In particular, we derive exact yet explicit formulas of average relative entropy of two independent states of arbitrary dimensions from the same ensemble as well as from two different ensembles. One ingredient in obtaining the results is the observed factorization of ensemble averages after evaluating the required unitary integral. The derived exact formula in the case of Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble complements the work by Kudler-Flam (2021 Phys Rev Lett 126 171603), where the corresponding asymptotic formula for states of equal dimensions was obtained based on the replica method.</description>

      <title>Sequential 1-bit Mean Estimation with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with 1-bit communication constraints. We propose a mean estimator that is based on (randomized and sequentially-chosen) interval queries, whose 1-bit outcome indicates whether the given sample lies in the specified interval. Our estimator is $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC for all distributions with bounded mean ($-\lambda \le \mathbb{E}(X) \le \lambda $) and variance ($\mathrm{Var}(X) \le \sigma^2$) for some known parameters $\lambda$ and $\sigma$. We derive a sample complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\big( \frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta} + \log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}\big)$, which matches the minimax lower bound for the unquantized setting up to logarithmic factors and the additional $\log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$ term that we show to be unavoidable. We also establish an adaptivity gap for interval-query based estimators: the best non-adaptive mean estimator is considerably worse than our adaptive mean estimator for large $\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$. Finally, we give tightened sample complexity bounds for distributions with stronger tail decay, and present additional variants that (i) handle an unknown sampling budget (ii) adapt to the unknown true variance given (possibly loose) upper and lower bounds on the variance, and (iii) use only two stages of adaptivity at the expense of more complicated (non-interval) queries.</description>

      <title>Privacy Mechanism Design based on Empirical Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pointwise maximal leakage (PML) is a per-outcome privacy measure based on threat models from quantitative information flow. Privacy guarantees with PML rely on knowledge about the distribution that generated the private data. In this work, we propose a framework for PML privacy assessment and mechanism design with empirical estimates of this data-generating distribution. By extending the PML framework to consider sets of data-generating distributions, we arrive at bounds on the worst-case leakage within a given set. We use these bounds alongside large-deviation bounds from the literature to provide a method for obtaining distribution-independent $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PML guarantees when the data-generating distribution is estimated from available data samples. We provide an optimal binary mechanism, and show that mechanism design with this type of uncertainty about the data-generating distribution reduces to a linearly constrained convex program. Further, we show that optimal mechanisms designed for a distribution estimate can be used. Finally, we apply these tools to leakage assessment of the Laplace mechanism and the Gaussian mechanism for binary private data, and numerically show that the presented approach to mechanism design can yield significant utility increase compared to local differential privacy, while retaining similar privacy guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.20073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work by Christensen and Popovski on secure $2$-user product computation for finite-fields of prime-order over a quantum multiple access channel, the generalization to $K$ users and arbitrary finite fields is explored. Asymptotically optimal (capacity-achieving for large alphabet) schemes are proposed. Additionally, the capacity of modulo-$d$ ($d\geq 2$) secure $K$-sum computation is shown to be $2/K$ computations/qudit, generalizing a result of Nishimura and Kawachi beyond binary, and improving upon it for odd $K$.</description>

      <title>DoDo-Code: an Efficient Levenshtein Distance Embedding-based Code for 4-ary IDS Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of new storage and communication methods, the insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) channel has attracted considerable attention. However, many topics on the IDS channel and the associated Levenshtein distance remain open, making the invention of a novel IDS-correcting code a hard task. Furthermore, current studies on single-IDS-correcting code misalign with the requirements of applications which necessitates the correcting of multiple errors. Compromise solutions have involved shortening codewords to reduce the chance of multiple errors. However, the code rates of existing codes are poor at short lengths, diminishing the overall storage density. In this study, a novel method is introduced for designing high-code-rate single-IDS-correcting codewords through deep Levenshtein distance embedding. A deep learning model is utilized to project the sequences into embedding vectors that preserve the Levenshtein distances between the original sequences. This embedding space serves as a proxy for the complex Levenshtein domain, within which algorithms for codeword search and segment correcting is developed. While the concept underpinning this approach is straightforward, it bypasses the mathematical challenges typically encountered in code design. The proposed method results in a code rate that outperforms existing combinatorial solutions, particularly for designing short-length codewords.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covert communication is the undetected transmission of sensitive information over a communication channel. In wireless communication systems, channel impairments such as signal fading present challenges in the effective implementation and analysis of covert communication systems. This paper generalizes early work in the covert communication field by considering asymptotic results for the number of bits that can be covertly transmitted in $n$ channel uses on a block fading channel. Critical to the investigation is characterizing the performance of optimal detectors at the adversary. Matching achievable and converse results are presented.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Assisted Wireless Powered Communication Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA)-assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a hybrid access point (HAP) equipped with multiple fixed position antennas (FPAs) provides integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) services towards low-power devices that are equipped with a single fluid antenna (FA), while the low-power devices use harvested energy to power their own uplink transmission. Using the block correlation channel model, both the downlink and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT) outage probabilities are analyzed under specific port selection strategies, including downlink signal-to-interference ratio-based port selection (DSPS) strategy, downlink energy harvesting power-based port selection (DEPS) strategy, uplink signal-to-noise ratio-based port selection (USPS) strategy, and uplink channel-based port selection (UCPS) strategy. A step function approximation (SFA) approach is also relied upon to derive closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities, while the lower bounds for uplink WDT outage probabilities are also formulated. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of our theoretical analysis, which also provide useful guidelines for the system design through the analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Meets RIS: Random Matrix Analysis and Two-Timescale Design for Multi-User Communications</title>

Abstract: The reconfigurability of fluid antenna systems (FASs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) provides significant flexibility in optimizing channel conditions by jointly adjusting the positions of fluid antennas and the phase shifts of RISs. However, it is challenging to acquire the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) for both fluid antennas and RISs, while frequent adjustment of antenna positions and phase shifts will significantly increase the system complexity. To tackle this issue, this paper investigates the two-timescale design for FAS-RIS multi-user systems with linear precoding, where only the linear precoder design requires instantaneous CSI of the end-to-end channel, while the FAS and RIS optimization relies on statistical CSI. The main challenge comes from the complex structure of channel and inverse operations in linear precoding, such as regularized zero-forcing (RZF) and zero-forcing (ZF). Leveraging on random matrix theory (RMT), we first investigate the fundamental limits of FAS-RIS systems with RZF/ZF precoding by deriving the ergodic sum rate (ESR). This result is utilized to determine the minimum number of selected antennas to achieve a given ESR. Based on the evaluation result, we propose an algorithm to jointly optimize the antenna selection, regularization factor of RZF, and phase shifts at the RIS. Numerical results validate the accuracy of performance evaluation and demonstrate that the performance gain brought by joint FAS and RIS design is more pronounced with a larger number of users.</description>

      <title>LOCO Codes Can Correct as Well: Error-Correction Constrained Coding for DNA Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a medium for cold data storage, DNA stands out as it promises significant gains in storage capacity and lifetime. However, it comes with its own data processing challenges to overcome. Constrained codes over the DNA alphabet $\{A,T,G,C\}$ have been used to design DNA sequences that are free of long homopolymers to increase stability, yet effective error detection and error correction are required to achieve reliability in data retrieval. Recently, we introduced lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes, namely DNA LOCO (D-LOCO) codes, with error detection. In this paper, we equip our D-LOCO codes with error correction for substitution errors via syndrome-like decoding, designated as residue decoding. We only use D-LOCO codewords of indices divisible by a suitable redundancy metric $R(m) &gt; 0$, where $m$ is the code length, for error correction. We provide the community with a construction of constrained codes forbidding runs of length higher than fixed $\ell \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $GC$-content in $\big [0.5-\frac{1}{2K},0.5+\frac{1}{2K}\big ]$ that correct $K$ segmented substitution errors, one per codeword. We call the proposed codes error-correction (EC) D-LOCO codes. We also give a list-decoding procedure with near-quadratic time-complexity in $m$ to correct double-substitution errors within EC D-LOCO codewords, which has $&gt; 98.20\%$ average success rate. The redundancy metric is projected to require $2\log_2(m)+O(1)$-bit allocation for a length-$m$ codeword. Hence, our EC D-LOCO codes are projected to be capacity-approaching with respect to the error-free constrained system.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecked Transformers: Periodic KV Cache Consolidation for Generalised Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer LLMs have been shown to exhibit strong reasoning ability that scales with inference-time compute, most prominently through token-space "thinking" chains of thought. A growing line of work pushes extra computation into the model's latent space, which we term Auxiliary Latent-Space Computation (ALSC). Existing ALSC methods largely fall into three buckets: (i) token-mediated latent rollouts, (ii) residual/activation steering, and (iii) memory (KV) compression. An underexplored alternative is memory consolidation/reconsolidation, two processes in the brain that are responsible for stabilising newly formed memory traces, and, upon recall, transiently rendering established traces plastic such they can integrate new contextual information before restabilising. In Transformer LLMs, this can be seen as analogous to performing in-place rewrites of new KV segments, and rewrites of recalled past segments. In this work, we give a theoretical justification as to why memory (re)consolidation via KV cache rewrites is beneficial for improved reasoning. We do this through the lens of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation emerges from an optimal balance between input information compression and retention of predictive information in latent representations. We then introduce the Bottlenecked Transformer, which augments a backbone LLM with a Cache Processor, an auxiliary Transformer that performs periodic, non-causal, in-place KV rewrites at newline-delimited reasoning step boundaries. The Processor consolidates recently written KV entries and reconsolidates a small, top-k attention-selected set of prior entries. We evaluate our Bottlenecked Transformer architecture on math reasoning benchmarks. Our model sees consistent performance gains over vanilla Transformers and pause-token augmented baselines, with gains of up to +6.6pp for selected tasks/backbones.</description>

      <title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17117v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories that balance compression with semantic meaning preservation. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate striking linguistic abilities, yet whether they achieve this same balance remains unclear. We apply the Information Bottleneck principle to quantitatively compare how LLMs and humans navigate this compression-meaning trade-off. Analyzing embeddings from 40+ LLMs against classic human categorization benchmarks, we uncover three key findings. First, LLMs broadly align with human categories but miss fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. Second, LLMs demonstrate aggressive statistical compression, achieving ``optimal'' information-theoretic efficiency, while humans prioritize contextual richness and adaptive flexibility. Third, encoder models surprisingly outperform decoder models in human alignment, suggesting that generation and understanding rely on distinct mechanisms in current architectures. In addition, training dynamics analysis reveals that conceptual structure develops in distinct phases: rapid initial formation followed by architectural reorganization, with semantic processing migrating from deeper to mid-network layers as models discover more efficient encoding. These divergent strategies, where LLMs optimize for compression and humans for adaptive utility, reveal fundamental differences between artificial and biological intelligence, guiding development toward more human-aligned AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-step error correction scheme for reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems. Using this scheme, it is possible to use error correction codes with small blocklengths (1000 bits), increasing secret key rates at a distance of 140km by up to 7.3 times.</description>
