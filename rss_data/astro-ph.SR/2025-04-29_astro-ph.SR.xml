      <title>The impact of wind mass loss on nucleosynthesis and yields of very massive stars at low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical feedback from stellar winds in low metallicity (Z) environments is key for understanding the evolution of globular clusters and the early Universe. With disproportionate mass lost from the most massive stars (M &gt; 100Msun), and an excess of such stars expected at the lowest metallicities, their contribution to the enrichment of the early pristine clusters could be significant. In this work, we examine the effect of mass loss at low metallicity on the nucleosynthesis and wind yields of (very) massive stars. We calculate stellar models with initial masses ranging from 30 to 500Msun during core Hydrogen and Helium burning phases, at four metallicities ranging from 20% Zsun down to 1% Zsun. The ejected masses and net yields are provided for each grid of models. While mass-loss rates decrease with Z, we find that not only are wind yields significant, but the nucleosynthesis is also altered due to the change in central temperatures and therefore also plays a role. We find that 80-300Msun models can produce large quantities of Na-rich and O-poor material, relevant for the observed Na-O anti-correlation in globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of Metal-Poor Red Giants Observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic archeology has long been limited by a lack of precise masses and ages for metal-poor stars in the Milky Way's thick disk. However, with TESS providing a growing number of photometric observations, it is possible to calculate masses and ages for more solar-like oscillators than ever using asteroseismology. We have used the pySYD pipeline to determine global asteroseismic parameters and calculated the masses and ages of $506$ metal-poor ([M/H] $&lt;$ -0.5) red giants observed by TESS. Our findings appear to show metallicity-dependent mass loss on the upper red giant branch and identify a set of "young" high-$\alpha$ stars that have been detected in other studies. We also find that $32.6\%$ of the metal-poor stars appear to be binary interaction products and four stars with stellar ages that could be from the Gaia Enceladus/Sausage system. In combination with existing ages from Kepler/K2, this data can be compared to galactic evolution models to better determine the formation history of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Occurrence and Impact of Carbon-Oxygen Shell Mergers in Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their final stages before undergoing a core-collapse supernova, massive stars may experience mergers between internal shells where carbon (C) and oxygen (O) are consumed as fuels for nuclear burning. This interaction, known as a C-O shell merger, can dramatically alter the internal structure of the star, leading to peculiar nucleosynthesis and potentially influencing the supernova explosion and the propagation of the subsequent supernova shock. Our understanding of the frequency and consequences of C-O shell mergers remains limited. This study aims to identify for the first time early diagnostics in the stellar structure which will lead to C-O shell mergers in more advanced stages. We also assess their role in shaping the chemical abundances in the most metal poor stars of the Galaxy. We analyze a set of 209 of stellar evolution models available in the literature, with different initial progenitor masses and metallicities. We then compare the nucleosynthetic yields from a subset of these models with the abundances of odd-Z elements in metal-poor stars. We find that the occurrence of C-O shell mergers in stellar models can be predicted with good approximation based on the outcomes of the central He burning phase, specifically, from the CO core mass ($\rm M_{CO}$) and the $\rm ^{12}C$ central mass fraction ($\rm X_{C12}$): 90$\%$ of models with a C-O merger have $\rm X_{C12}&lt; 0.277$ and $\rm M_{CO}&lt; 4.90 M_{\odot}$, with average values $\rm M_{CO} = 4.02 M_{\odot}$ and $\rm X_{C12}= 0.176$. Additionally, we confirm that the Sc-rich and K-rich yields from models with C-O mergers would solve the long-standing underproduction of these elements in massive stars. Our results emphasize the crucial role of C-O shell mergers in enriching the interstellar medium, particularly in the production of odd-Z elements.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Uncertainties in Solar Wind Forecasting Due to Incomplete Solar Magnetic Field Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar wind forecasting plays a crucial role in space weather prediction, yet significant uncertainties persist due to incomplete magnetic field observations of the Sun. Isolating the solar wind forecasting errors due to these effects is difficult. This study investigates the uncertainties in solar wind models arising from these limitations. We simulate magnetic field maps with known uncertainties, including far-side and polar field variations, as well as resolution and sensitivity limitations. These maps serve as input for three solar wind models: the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA), the Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation (HUXt), and the European Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA). We analyze the discrepancies in solar wind forecasts, particularly the solar wind speed at Earth's location, by comparing the results of these models to a created "ground truth" magnetic field map, which is derived from a synthetic solar rotation evolution using the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model. The results reveal significant variations within each model with a RMSE ranging from 59-121 km/s. Further comparison with the thermodynamic Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model indicates that uncertainties in the magnetic field data can lead to even larger variations in solar wind forecasts compared to those within a single model. However, predicting a range of solar wind velocities based on a cloud of points around Earth can help mitigate uncertainties by up to 20-77%.</description>

      <title>Exploring circumstellar chemistry in X-ray emitting AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Our goal is to characterize the chemistry and physical conditions of the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) binary candidate stars with UV-excess and X-ray emission, in particular, to identify the effects of the internal X-ray emission in the abundance of certain key molecules. Methods. We observed the 86.0-94.0 and 260.0-272.5 GHz spectral ranges searching for rotational transitions of the X-ray sensitive molecule $HCO^{+}$ in four AGB stars, two of them detected in both UV and X-ray emission and the other two detected only in UV. We derived the CSEs's physical parameters from previous CO observations and determined the molecular abundances of the detected species using radiative transfer models. We developed chemical kinetics models that account for the effects of internal X-ray emission (as well as UV radiation) and compared our predictions with observations. Results. We report the detection of $HCO^{+}$ in the X-ray emitting C-rich AGB T\,Dra, while it remains undetected in the spectra of the other three sources. In T\,Dra we also detect SiO, HCN, HNC, $HC_{3}N$, $SiC_{2}$, $C_{2}H$ and SiS. For the other targets only HCN and SiO are detected. The high fractional abundance of $HCO^{+}$ derived for T\,Dra ($[1.5-3.0]\times 10^{-8}$) is in good agreement with the predictions from our chemical kinetics models including the effects of internal X-ray emission, and one order of magnitude higher than the values expected for C-rich AGB stars. Additionally, we identify abundance enhancements for HNC, and $HC_{3}N$ alongside a depletion of CO in the innermost regions of T\,Dra's envelope. Conclusions. An internal X-ray source can significantly alter molecular abundances in AGB CSEs, enhancing $HCO^{+}$, $N_{2}H^{+}$, HNC, and $HC_{3}N$ while depleting parent species like CO. UV radiation has a weaker effect unless the envelope is optically thin or porous.</description>

      <title>Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars: spectral library, metallicities and abundances of $\alpha$ and Fe-peak elements of the third version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate determination of chemical abundances in stars plays a pivotal role in understanding stellar structure and evolution, nucleosynthesis, and the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. Benchmark stars with precise and accurate atmospheric parameters and abundances are indispensable for calibrating spectroscopic surveys and testing stellar atmosphere models. This study focuses on the compilation of high-quality spectra and the determination of LTE chemical abundances of iron-peak and $\alpha$ elements for the third version of the Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars (GBSv3). We compiled spectra of the GBSv3 from public archives and complemented these with our own observations. We use fundamental atmospheric parameters from Soubiran et al. 2024 to derive the chemical abundances and perform a spectroscopic analysis using the public code iSpec. We compile a homogeneous spectral library of high-resolution (42,000) and high signal-to-noise ($&gt;100$) normalised spectra for 202 stars: including the 192 GBSv3, 9 stars with indirect measurement of the angular diameter from previous GBS versions, and the Sun. Using four radiative transfer codes, we derive chemical abundances of 13 chemical species (Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I). We make an in-depth study of several sources of error. The GBSv3 contributes to the legacy samples of spectroscopic reference stars with improved statistics and homogeneity. The compiled high-resolution spectral library and the determination of abundances for iron-peak and $\alpha$ elements, together with an extensive discussion of the linked uncertainties, provides a sample of reference abundances to the community.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Period-Luminosity Relations of delta Scuti Stars: A Pathway to Distance and 3-D Dust Map Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While delta Scuti stars are the most numerous class of kappa-mechanism pulsators in the instability strip, the short periods and small peak-to-peak amplitudes have left them understudied and underutilized. Recently, large-scale time-domain surveys have significantly increased the number of identified delta Scuti stars. Notably, the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS), with its high-cadence observations at 1-minute intervals, has identified thousands of delta Scuti stars, greatly expanding the sample of these short-period pulsating variables. Using the delta Scuti stars from the TMTS catalogs of Periodic Variable Stars, we cross-matched the dataset with Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE to obtain photometric measurements across optical and infrared bands. Parallax data, used as Bayesian priors, were retrieved from Gaia DR3, and line-of-sight dust extinction priors were estimated from a three-dimensional dust map. Using PyMC, we performed a simultaneous determination of the 11-band P-L relations of delta Scuti stars, which not only yields precise measurements of these relations, but also greatly improves constraints on the distance moduli and color excesses, as evidenced by the reduced uncertainties in the posterior distributions. Furthermore, our methodology enables an independent estimation of the color excess through the P-L relations, offering a potential complement to existing 3-D dust maps. Moreover, by cross-matching with LAMOST DR7, we investigated the influence of metallicity on the P-L relations. Our analysis reveals that incorporating metallicity might reduce the intrinsic scatter at longer wavelengths. However, this result does not achieve 3 sigma significance, leaving open the possibility that the observed reduction is attributable to statistical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A search for Maunder-minimum candidate stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars with very low levels of magnetic activity provide an opportunity for a more quantitative comparison with the Sun during its Maunder minimum. We employ spectra from the RAVE survey in a search for particularly low-activity stars with the goal of identifying candidates for so-called Maunder-minimum stars. Spectra were used to measure the relative flux in the cores of the Ca II infrared-triplet (IRT) lines. Those were converted to absolute emission-line fluxes and were corrected with target fluxes from high-resolution STELLA and ultra-high-resolution PEPSI spectra. Absolute Ca II IRT fluxes for a total of 78111 RAVE dwarf stars are presented and compared with fluxes of the 123 stars from our high-resolution STELLA+PEPSI sample. RAVE fluxes appear higher than the STELLA and PEPSI fluxes by on average 19% for IRT-1, 21% for IRT-2, and 25% for IRT-3 due to their lower spectral resolution. Our sample also spans a metallicity [Fe/H] range relative to the Sun of -1.5 to +0.5 dex. We confirm the strong dependency of IRT fluxes on metallicity and quantify it to be at most $\pm$14% in the B-V range 0.53-0.73. Without a metallicity correction, practically all very-low-activity RAVE dwarfs show a super-solar metallicity. After correcting for spectral resolution and for metallicity, we find 13 RAVE stars out of 13326 (0.1%) that fall well below our empirical lower flux bound from high-resolution versus B-V. For solar B-V, this relates to a photospheric uncorrected radiative loss in the IRT lines of log R_IRT=-4.13 (~20% below the solar-minimum value in late 2016). However, 11 targets turned out to be evolved stars based on their Gaia DR3 parallaxes. Two stars, TIC 352227373 (G2V) and TYC 7560-477-1 (G7V), are our only Maunder-minimum candidates from the present search. Contrary to the initial suggestion from the Mount-Wilson H&amp;K Survey, we conclude that such stars are very rare.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moment-Field Interactions, A Universal Mechanism for Particle Energization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a pivotal mechanisms in the energization and heating of cosmic plasmas, yet the exact process of energy transfer during these events remain elusive. Traditional models, which focus on acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves and micro/nano-flares, fall short of explaining the extreme heating of the solar corona and the origins of the supersonic solar wind. In this study, we provide compelling observational evidence from Wind spacecraft data supporting the Raghav effect, a mechanism where interactions between the magnetic moments of charged particles and dynamic magnetic fields result in abrupt kinetic energy changes. Our analysis demonstrates that the observed proton plasma heating is consistent with theoretical predictions, establishing the Raghav effect as a universal mechanism for particle energization. This discovery offers a unified framework for understanding energy dynamics across a wide range of astrophysical magnetised plasma environments.</description>

      <title>DUETS: Setting expectations for asteroseismic binaries and binary products with synthetic populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology gives us the opportunity to better characterize binaries and their products, and shed light on their role in Galactic populations. We estimate occurrence rates, mass distributions, and evolutionary states of asteroseismic binaries, exhibiting solar-like oscillations from both components, and of products of binary interactions with detectable solar-like oscillations. Additionally, we explore the effects of mass accretion or loss on apparent age-metallicity relations. Using the TRILEGAL code, we simulate Kepler's field of view adopting the Eggleton and Moe &amp; Di Stefano distributions of initial binary parameters, and run an additional simulation with non-interacting binaries for comparison. We find that asteroseismic binaries require an initial mass ratio close to one, and even small mass transfer events can prevent the detection of oscillations from both components. The fraction of asteroseismic binaries for red giant stars with detectable oscillations ranges from 0.5\% for non-interacting binaries to a minimum of 0.06% when taking interactions into account. Moreover, asteroseismic binaries composed of two red clump stars are not expected at separations $\leq 500~\text{R}_\odot$ due to the interplay of stellar evolution and binary interactions. Finally, we estimate that at least ~1% of the Kepler red giants with detectable oscillations have undergone significant mass accretion or loss, potentially affecting Galactic age-metallicity relations, although there is a strong dependence on the assumed initial binary parameters. Comparing predicted and observed asteroseismic binaries, as well as over- and under-massive stars, offers a way to constrain key binary evolution assumptions, and to reduce uncertainties in mass-transfer modeling.</description>

      <title>Accretion and Recovery in Giant Eruptions of Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant Eruptions (GEs) are episodic high-rate mass loss events that massive stars experience in the late stage of evolutions before exploding as a core-collapse supernova. If it occurs in a binary system, the companion star can accrete part of the mass. We use numerical simulations to analyze how the companion responds to accretion and how its structure and evolution are altered. We run a grid of massive stars with masses from $20~\rm M_{\odot}$ to $60~\rm M_{\odot}$, and accretion rates from $\rm 10^{-4}$ to $\rm 0.1~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, over a duration of $20$ yrs. For accretion rates $\rm \lesssim 0.01~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ the star remains on the hotter side of the HR diagram with a minor increase in luminosity without expanding, as the accretion timescale exceeds the thermal time scale by a larger factor. Mass loss through stellar winds leads to a minor drop in luminosity shortly after the accretion phase as the star enters the recovery phase. For $\rm \gtrsim 0.01~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ the companion star experiences a sudden increase in luminosity by about one order of magnitude, inflates, and cools. Under the accreted gas layer the star retains its structure and continues to eject radiation-driven wind during the recovery phase, namely the time it takes to regain equilibrium. Eventually, the accreted material mixes with the inner layers of the star, and the star continues to evolve as a more massive star.</description>

      <title>Polarization of light from fast rotating Wolf-Rayet stars: A Monte Carlo simulations compared to analytical formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are potential progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts, but observational verification is challenging. Spectral lines from their expanding stellar wind obscure accurate rotational velocity measurements. Intrinsic polarization from wind rotation may help determine rotational speeds, requiring precise wind models. Our study aims to investigate the intrinsic polarization due to the rotational distortion of WR winds considering multiple scattering of photons and compare it to a single-scattering model, where we use an analytical expression of the polarization. We study the polarization signatures resulting from the prolate structure of rotating winds of two WR stars using a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Hyperion. We estimated the intrinsic polarization resulting from multiple scattering in WR winds for different rotational velocities, inclination angles, and mass-loss rates. Our results indicate that at a rotation rate of less than 50 % of the critical rate, the intrinsic polarization from multiple scattering is close to that of a single scattering model. However, at higher rotation velocities, the polarization from multiple scattering increases with inclination up to 40$^\circ$, while it decreases for inclinations higher than about 60$^\circ$. This dependence is inconsistent with the single-scattering model. We also discuss the effect of the mass-loss rate on the polarization and find that the polarization changes linearly with the mass-loss rate. However, it is important to note that the relationship between polarization and mass-loss rate may vary for different types of stars. The results have implications for future studies of stellar winds and mass loss and may help to improve our understanding of the complex environments of massive stars. Our research offers valuable information on the complex polarization patterns observed in stellar winds.</description>

      <title>An explanation for the radio variation associated with the Vela pulsar glitch occurred on December 12 2016</title>

Abstract: The elaborate observation of the single radio pulses of Vela pulsar around the pulsar glitch that occurred on December 12, 2016 reveals that the physical mechanism associated with this glitch exert a profound influence on the pulsar's magnetosphere. According to the evolution of these pulses, we propose a scenario regarding how the pulsar magnetic field might undergo alterations within the framework of the inner gap model. We deduce that the liberation of the free energy within Vela pulsar results in the emergence of new magnetic multipole components. The progressively developing multipole components cause the magnetic field lines in a section of the polar cap region to become increasingly curved, ultimately resulting in the observed pulse broadening and pulse missing. At last, we discuss the possible connection between magnetic variations and fast radio bursts according to the inspiration of the presented picture.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. X. channel maps reveal complex $^{12}$CO abundance distributions and a variety of kinematic structures with evidence for embedded planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$ data cubes of the disks in the exoALMA program. 13/15 disks reveal a variety of kinematic substructures in individual channels: large-scale arcs or spiral arms, localized velocity kinks, and/or multiple faints arcs that appear like filamentary structures on the disk surface. We find kinematic signatures that are consistent with planet wakes in six disks: AA Tau, SY Cha, J1842, J1615, LkCa 15 and HD 143006. Comparison with hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations suggests planets with orbital radii between 80 and 310\,au and masses between 1 and 5 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$. Additional kinematic substructures limit our ability to place tight constraints on the planet masses. When the inclination is favorable to separate the upper and lower surfaces (near 45$^\mathrm{o}$, i.e. in 7/15 disks), we always detect the vertical CO snowline and find that the $^{12}$CO freeze-out is partial in the disk midplane, with a depletion factor of $\approx 10^{-3}$ - $10^{-2}$ compared to the warm molecular layer. In these same seven disks, we also systematically detect evidence of CO desorption in the outer regions.</description>

      <title>Global Simulations of Gravitational Instability in Protostellar Disks with Full Radiation Transport II. Locality of Gravitoturbulence, Clumpy Spirals, and Implications for Observable Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral perturbations in a gravitationally unstable accretion disk regulate disk evolution through angular-momentum transport and heating and provide an observational signature of gravitational instability (GI). We use global 3D simulations to systematically characterize and understand these spiral perturbations. The spiral perturbations and the resulting transport are overall insensitive to the cooling type, with the exception that radiative cooling, especially in the optically thick regime, reduces the amplitude of temperature perturbations. Spiral perturbations are localized around corotation, allowing transport to be approximated by a local $\alpha$ viscosity to zeroth order in aspect ratio ($H/R$), but only after averaging over multiple orbits in time and/or multiple scale heights in space. Meanwhile, large-amplitude perturbations from strong gravitoturbulence can cause $\mathcal O(\alpha^{1/2})$ deviation in the cooling rate of the disk. We develop empirical prescriptions for the angular-momentum transport, heating, and cooling in a gravitoturbulent disk that capture the deviation from a viscous, unperturbed disk to first order in $H/R$ and $\alpha^{1/2}$. The spiral perturbations in saturated gravitoturbulence are clumpy, with dense clumps forming through the nonlinear coupling between multiple modes at different $m$. Observationally, the clumpy gravitoturbulence produced by saturated GI can be mistaken with observational noise or embedded companions, especially under finite resolution. Meanwhile, grand-design spirals with $m$-fold symmetry may be uncommon among disks in saturated gravitoturbulence, and we speculate that they may instead be a signature of recently triggered or decaying GI.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Distribution in M31 and M33 Based on the Tip-RGB Near-infrared Color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the metallicity distribution in M31 and M33 by using the near-infrared color index $J-K$ of tip-red-giant-branch (TRGB) of the member stars from \cite{2021ApJ...907...18R} after removing the foreground dwarf stars by the near-infrared $J-H/H-K$ diagram as well as the Gaia astrometric measurements. We employ the Voronoi binning technique to divide the galaxy into sub-regions, the PN method to determine the TRGB position in the $J-K$/$K$ diagram, and the bootstrap method to estimate the uncertainties. The TRGB positions are calculated to be $J-K = 1.195 \pm 0.002$ and $1.100 \pm 0.003$, and $K = 17.615 \pm 0.007$ and $18.185 \pm 0.053$ for M31 and M33 respectively as an entity, consistent with previous results. The $J-K$ gradient of M31 is found to be $-$0.0055 kpc$^{-1}$ at $R_{\rm GC}=(0, 24)$ kpc and $-$0.0002 kpc$^{-1}$ at $R_{\rm GC}=(24, 150)$ kpc. Notably, two dust rings are evident at 11.5 kpc and 14.5 kpc, in agreement with previous studies. The $J-K$ of M33 is analyzed in four directions and generally shows a trend of gradually decreasing from the inside to the outside, however, it shows an increasing trend of 0.022 kpc$^{-1}$ in the inner 0$-$2 kpc in the west. Through the color$-$metallicity relation of TRGB, the metallicity gradient of M31 turns to be $-0.040 \pm 0.0012$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}&lt;30$ kpc and $-0.001 \pm 0.0002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}&gt;30$ kpc, and for M33, $-$0.269 $\pm$ 0.0206 dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}&lt;9$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Search for high energy 5.5 MeV solar axions with the complete Borexino dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A search for solar axions and axion-like particles produced in the $p+d\rightarrow\rm{^3He}+A~(5.5\rm{ ~MeV})$ reaction was performed using the complete dataset of the Borexino detector (3995 days of measurement live-time). The following interaction processes have been considered: axion decay into two photons $({\rm A}\rightarrow2\gamma)$, inverse Primakoff conversion on nuclei $({\rm A}+Z\rightarrow\gamma+Z$), the Compton conversion of axions to photons $({\rm A}+e\rightarrow e+\gamma)$ and the axio-electric effect $({\rm A}+e+Z\rightarrow e+Z$). Model-independent limits on axion-photon ($g_{A\gamma}$), axion-electron ($g_{Ae}$), and isovector axion-nucleon ($g_{3AN}$) couplings are obtained: $|g_{A\gamma}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 2.3\times 10^{-11} \rm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $|g_{Ae}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 1.9\times 10^{-13}$ at $m_A &lt;$ 1 MeV (90\% c.l.). The Borexino results exclude new large regions of $g_{A\gamma}$, and $g_{Ae}$ coupling constants and axion masses $m_A$, and leads to constraints on the products $|g_{A\gamma}\times m_A|$ and $|g_{Ae}\times m_A|$ for the KSVZ- and the DFSZ-axion models.</description>

      <title>Explosive growth of large-scale magnetic fluctuations due to particle scattering on developed small-scale Weibel turbulence in magnetoactive plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical theory of non-linear generation of large-scale magnetic turbulence in anisotropic magnetoactive plasma in the quasilinear approximation without taking into account the direct non-linear interaction of individual harmonics is constructed. It is shown that anomalous collisions of particles due to scattering on small-scale fluctuations of the developed Weibel turbulence lead to instability of long-wave harmonics, which are stable in the linear approximation. The non-linear growth of such harmonics at a given anisotropy of the particle velocity distribution, consistent with the dynamics of short-wave perturbations at the saturation stage and possible anisotropic particle injection, occurs in the superexponential regime and corresponds to an explosive-type instability. The growth law of the large-scale magnetic field is found analytically and the critical time of explosive instability is estimated.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Catastrophically Disrupted Open Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Of the many discoveries uncovered by the Gaia astrometric mission, some of the most exciting are related to nearby dispersed stellar structures. We analyze one such structure in the Milky Way disk, OCSN-49, a coeval stellar stream with 257 identified members spanning approximately 30$^\circ$ across the sky. We obtained high-resolution spectroscopic data for four members that span the stream's extent, finding these four stars to have solar metallicities and remarkably homogeneous chemistry. Through a combination of isochrone fitting, lithium abundance analysis, and gyrochronology, we find a consistent stellar age of 400--600 Myr. Integrating stellar orbits backwards reveals that OCSN-49 converged to a single point at a much younger age. By integrating unbound model stars forward and comparing them to the current phase-space distribution of OCSN-49, we derive a dynamical age of 83$\pm$1 Myr, inconsistent with the age of the stellar population. The discrepancy between the kinematic and stellar age indicators is naturally explained by a disruptive event that unbound OCSN-49 roughly 500 Myr into its lifetime. Based on rate estimates, disruption due to a passing giant molecular cloud (GMC) is the most likely culprit. Assuming a single encounter, we find that a nearly head-on collision with a fairly massive GMC ($\sim$10$^5$ M$_\odot$) was necessary to unbind the cluster, although encounters with multiple GMCs may be responsible. To our knowledge, OCSN-49 serves as the first known remnant of a catastrophically disrupted open cluster and therefore serves as a benchmark for further investigating cluster disruption in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Constraints on Black Hole Formation in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino signals associated with black hole formation resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, motivated by the candidate failed supernova M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). By compiling numerical simulation results for stellar collapse, we predict the expected neutrino emission and compare these predictions with observational limits from Super-Kamiokande (SK). The simulations reveal a characteristic precursor signal consisting of a short, intense burst whose average neutrino energy rises rapidly and then ceases abruptly once the black hole forms. We examine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer \&amp; Swesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on neutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the predicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with M31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS. These findings demonstrate the capability of neutrino astronomy to probe core collapse and black hole formation in failed supernova scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The HMYSO G24.33+0.14 (G24), has recently been observed to undergo an accretion burst since September 2019, lasting approximately two years. By utilizing 1.3 mm observational data from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in March 2020 and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in September 2019, we have examined the physical environment changes in gas and dust within G24 region during the decay phase of the accretion burst. Following the burst, the continuum emission in the inner core region of G24 diminished by approximately 20%, while the emission in the outer region exhibited an increase by a factor of ~30%. This pattern indicates that the heat wave, triggered by the accretion burst, radiated outward from the core's interior to its periphery over the half-year period, with a calculated propagation speed of 0.08-0.38 times the speed of light. Moreover, the methanol emission intensity in this area has experienced a notable decline, with the rate of flux reduction correlating positively with the energy of the upper energy states. This, in conjunction with the analysis of methanol molecular line rotation temperature diagrams for different emitting regions, further substantiates that the core region of G24 cooled down, contrasted with the persistent heating in the outer region following the burst.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed a plethora of substructures in the disks surrounding young stars. These substructures have several proposed formation mechanisms, with one leading theory being the interaction between the disk and newly formed planets. In this Letter, we present high angular resolution ALMA observations of LkCa~15's disk that reveal a striking difference in dust and CO emission morphology. The dust continuum emission shows a ring-like structure characterized by a dust-depleted inner region of $\sim$40 au in radius. Conversely, the CO emission is radially smoother and shows no sign of gas depletion within the dust cavity. We compare the observations with models for the disk-planet interaction, including radiative transfer calculation in the dust and CO emission. This source is particularly interesting as the presence of massive planets within the dust cavity has been suggested based on previous NIR observations. We find that the level of CO emission observed within the dust cavity is inconsistent with the presence of planets more massive than Jupiter orbiting between 10-40 au. Instead, we argue that the LkCa~15 innermost dust cavity might be created either by a chain of low-mass planets, or by other processes that do not require the presence of planets.</description>

      <title>Tracing the ejecta structure of SN 1987A: Insights and diagnostics from 3D MHD simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A provides a unique window into the aftermath of a massive stellar explosion, offering key insights into the ejecta's morphology, composition, explosion mechanism, progenitor system, and circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction. We investigate large-scale ejecta asymmetries in SN 1987A. By comparing the simulations with JWST observations and making predictions for XRISM, we aim to refine our understanding of the explosion mechanism and the remnant's evolution. We performed 3D MHD simulations that trace the evolution of SN 1987A from the SN to the SNR, extending our predictions up to 5000 years into the future and considering the Ni-bubble effects. The simulation results are compared with JWST observations and used to predict XRISM spectra, to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled ejecta structure. Our simulations reproduce the large-scale Fe-rich ejecta morphology seen by JWST, revealing two clumps suggestive of a bipolar explosion. Ni-bubble effects in the first year boost Fe-rich ejecta expansion and their interaction with the reverse shock. However, discrepancies with JWST observations in clump velocities and spatial distribution suggest stronger explosion asymmetries than modeled. Since 2021, our models predict that shocked ejecta have contributed increasingly to X-ray emission, now rivaling shocked CSM and soon dominating as the latter fades. Future XRISM observations will trace the evolution of these ejecta structures, refining constraints on explosion geometry. Early remnant asymmetries from CSM interaction may persist for at least 100 years. Our results underscore the role of asymmetric core-collapse mechanisms in shaping SN 1987A's ejecta and constraining its explosion geometry. Future studies should explore more extreme asymmetries, in neutrino-driven core collapse or magneto-rotational SN models, to identify the origin of its bipolar Fe-rich structure.</description>

      <title>The Dust Echo Emission of Fast Blue Optical Transients and Application to the Near-Infrared Excess of AT 2018cow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A near-infrared (NIR) excess has been discovered in the emission of the representative fast blue optical transient (FBOT): AT 2018cow. It was suggested that this NIR excess could be emitted by the dust surrounding the source and, thus, could provide a probe into the nature of its progenitor. We develop a model to describe the influence of the FBOT emission on the environmental dust and, as a result, a dust-free evaporation cavity can be formed on a timescale of one day. Outside this cavity, the surviving dust grains can have different size distributions at different distances to the source. With such a special dust environment, we fit the multi-wavelength light curves of AT 2018cow by taking into account the evolutionary dust echo of the FBOT emission. It is found that the dust temperature can vary with time along with the evolution of the irradiating FBOT emission. Even at a fixed time, the dust temperature can be distributed in a wide range rather than having only a unique value. Furthermore, both the mass of the dust shell and its distance to the FBOT are found to be much larger than those derived with a direct empirical fitting of the NIR spectra but without considering the evolutionary relationship between the spectra.</description>

      <title>exoALMA III: Line-intensity Modeling and System Property Extraction from Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALMA large program exoALMA offers a unique window into the three-dimensional physical and dynamical properties of 15 circumstellar disks where planets may be actively forming. Here, we present an analysis methodology to map the gas disk structure and substructure encoded in 12CO, 13CO, and CS line emission from our targets. To model and characterize the disk structure probed by optically thin species, such as CS and, in some cases, 13CO, we introduce a composite line profile kernel that accounts for increased intensities caused by the projected overlap between the disk's front and back side emission. Our workflow, built on the Discminer modelling framework, incorporates an improved iterative two-component fitting method for inclined sources ($i&gt;40^\circ$), to mitigate the impact of the disk backside on the extraction of velocity maps. Also, we report best-fit parameters for the Keplerian stellar masses, as well as inclinations, position angles, systemic velocities, rotation direction, and emission surfaces of the disks in our sample.</description>

      <title>exoALMA XV: Interpreting the height of CO emission layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of exquisite data and the development of new analysis techniques have enabled the study of emitting heights in proto-planetary disks. In this paper we introduce a simple model linking the emitting height of CO to the disk surface density and temperature structure. We then apply the model to measurements of the emitting height and disk temperature conducted as part of exoALMA, integrated with additional legacy measurements from the MAPS Large Programme, to derive CO column densities and surface density profiles (assuming a CO abundance) for a total of 14 disks. A unique feature of the method we introduce to measure surface densities is that it can be applied to optically thick observations, rather than optically thin as conventionally done. While we use our method on a sample of well studied disks where temperature structures have been derived using two emission lines, we show that reasonably accurate estimates can be obtained also when only one molecular transition is available. With our method we obtain independent constraints from $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO and we find they are in general good agreement using the standard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio. The masses derived from our method are systematically lower compared with the values derived dynamically from the rotation curve if using an ISM CO abundance, implying that CO is depleted by a median factor $\sim$20 with respect to the ISM value, in line with other works that find that CO is depleted in proto-planetary disks.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. XVII. Characterizing the Gas Dynamics around Dust Asymmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key planet-formation processes in protoplanetary disks remain an active matter of research. One promising mechanism to radially and azimuthally trap millimeter-emitting dust grains, enabling them to concentrate and grow into planetesimals, is anticyclonic vortices. While dust observations have revealed crescent structures in several disks, observations of their kinematic signatures are still lacking. Studying the gas dynamics is, however, essential to confirm the presence of a vortex and understand its dust trapping properties. In this work, we make use of the high-resolution and sensitivity observations conducted by the exoALMA large program to search for such signatures in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO molecular line emission of four disks with azimuthal dust asymmetries: HD 135344B, HD 143006, HD 34282, and MWC 758. To assess the vortex features, we constructed an analytical vortex model and performed hydrodynamical simulations. For the latter, we assumed two scenarios: a vortex triggered at the edge of a dead zone and of a gap created by a massive embedded planet. These models reveal a complex kinematical morphology of the vortex. When compared to the data, we find that none of the sources show a distinctive vortex signature around the dust crescents in the kinematics.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass stars and the origin of the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of known planets around intermediate-mass stars (1.5 M$_{\odot}$ &lt; M$_{\star}$ &lt; 3.5 M$_{\odot}$) is rather low. We aim to test whether the correlation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of gas-giant planets found for MS low-mass stars still holds for intermediate-mass stars. In particular, we aim to understand whether or not the planet-metallicity relation changes as stars evolve from the pre-MS to the red giant branch. Our results confirm that pre-MS stars with transitional discs with gaps show lower metallicities than pre-MS with flat discs. We show a tendency of intermediate-mass stars in the MS to follow the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation, although the differences in metal content between planet and non-planet hosts are rather modest and the strength of the correlation is significantly lower than for the less massive FGK MS stars. For stars in the red giant branch, we find a strong planet-metallicity correlation, compatible with that found for FGK MS stars. We discuss how the evolution of the mass in the convective zone of the star's interior might affect the measured metallicity of the star. The lack of a well-established planet-metallicity correlation in pre-MS and MS intermediate-mass stars can be explained by a scenario in which planet formation leads to an accretion of metal-poor material on the surface of the star. As intermediate-mass stars are mainly radiative the metallicity of the star does not reflect its bulk composition but the composition of the accreted material. When the star leaves the MS and develops a sizeable convective envelope, a strong-planet metallicity correlation is recovered. Thus, our results are in line with core-accretion models of planet formation and the idea that the planet-metallicity correlation reflects a bulk property of the star.</description>

      <title>Observation-Based Iterative Map for Solar Cycles. I. Nature of Solar Cycle Variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inter-cycle variations in the series of 11-year solar activity cycles have a significant impact on both the space environment and climate. Whether solar cycle variability is dominated by deterministic chaos or stochastic perturbations remains an open question. Distinguishing between the two mechanisms is crucial for predicting solar cycles. Here we reduce the solar dynamo process responsible for the solar cycle to a one-dimensional iterative map, incorporating recent advance in the observed nonlinearity and stochasticity of the cycle. We demonstrate that deterministic chaos is absent in the nonlinear system, regardless of model parameters, if the generation of the poloidal field follows an increase-then-saturate pattern as the cycle strength increases. The synthesized solar cycles generated by the iterative map exhibit a probability density function (PDF) similar to that of observed normal cycles, supporting the dominant role of stochasticity in solar cycle variability. The parameters governing nonlinearity and stochasticity profoundly influence the PDF. The iterative map provides a quick and effective tool for predicting the range, including uncertainty of the subsequent cycle strength when an ongoing cycle amplitude is known. Due to stochasticity, a solar cycle loses almost all its original information within 1 or 2 cycles. Although the simplicity of the iterative map, the behaviors it exhibits are generic for the nonlinear system. Our results provide guidelines for analyzing solar dynamo models in terms of chaos and stochasticity, highlight the limitation in predicting solar cycle, and motivate further refinement of observational constraints on nonlinear and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Multiplicity of early B-type supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blue supergiant (BSG) domain contains a large variety of stars whose past and future evolutionary paths are still highly uncertain. Since binary interaction plays a crucial role in the fate of massive stars, investigating the multiplicity among BSGs helps shed light on the fate of such objects. We aim to estimate the binary fraction of a large sample of BSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud within the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey. In total, we selected 262 targets with spectral types B0-B3 and luminosity classes I-II. This work is based on spectroscopic data collected by the GIRAFFE instrument, mounted on the Very Large Telescope, which gathered nine epochs over three months. Our spectroscopic analysis for each target includes the individual and peak-to-peak radial velocity measurements, an investigation of the line profile variability, and a periodogram analysis to search for possible short- and long-period binaries. By applying a 20 km s$^{-1}$ threshold on the peak-to-peak radial velocities above which we would consider the star to be binary, the resulting observed spectroscopic binary fraction for our BSG sample is 23 $\pm$ 3$\%$. In addition, we derived reliable orbital periods for 41 spectroscopic binaries and potential binary candidates, among which there are 17 eclipsing binaries, including 20 SB1 and SB2 systems with periods of less than 10 days. We reported a significant drop in the binary fraction of BSGs with spectral types later than B2 and effective temperatures less than 18 kK, which could indicate the end of the main sequence phase in this temperature regime. We found no metallicity dependence in the binary fraction of BSGs, compared to existing spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive UV and Optical spectral analysis of Cygnus X-1: Stellar and wind parameters, abundances, and evolutionary implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of Cyg X-1, utilizing archival high-resolution UV and optical spectra in conjunction with sophisticated atmospheric models. Notably, this is the first investigation to simultaneously analyze UV and optical spectra of Cyg X-1 along with incorporating X-rays to constrain the stellar and wind parameters. Our analysis yields notably lower masses for both the donor (29$\,M_\odot$) and the black hole (12.7 to 17.8$\,M_\odot$, depending on inclination), and confirms that the donor's radius is close to reaching the inner Lagrangian point. We find super-solar Fe, Si, and Mg abundances (1.3-1.8 times solar) at the surface of the donor star, while the total CNO abundance remains solar despite evidence of CNO processing (N enrichment, O depletion) and He enrichment. This abundance pattern is distinct from the surrounding Cyg OB3 association. We observe a clear difference in wind parameters between X-ray states: $v_\infty \approx 1200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M} \approx 3\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the high/soft state, increasing to $v_\infty\lesssim 1800\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the low/hard state. The observed X-ray luminosity is consistent with wind-fed accretion. Evolutionary models show that Cyg X-1 will undergo Roche lobe overflow in the near future. Under a fully conservative mass accretion scenario, our models predict a future binary black hole merger for Cyg X-1 within $\sim5$ Gyr. Our comprehensive analysis provides refined stellar and wind parameters of the donor star in Cyg X-1, highlighting the importance of using advanced atmospheric models and considering X-ray ionization and wind clumping. The observed abundances suggest a complex formation history involving a high initial metallicity.</description>

Abstract: Short-period Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) systems will be observable both in visible light through photometric monitoring and in mHz-range gravitational waves (GWs) with forthcoming space-based laser interferometry such as LISA. When only photometric variability is used to measure DWD intrinsic properties, there is a degeneracy between the chirp mass and binary tidal interaction, as orbital frequency time derivative is set by both GW radiation and tides. Without expensive radial velocity data from spectroscopic monitoring, this degeneracy may be lifted in principle by directly measuring the second time derivative of the orbital frequency through photometric monitoring over an ultra-long time baseline. Alternatively, the degeneracy can be removed by exploiting information in both photometric variability and the coherent GW waveform. Investigating both approaches, we find that direct measurement of the second time derivative is likely infeasible for most DWDs, while the multi-messenger method will disentangle measurements of the chirp mass and the binary moments of inertia, for a large sample of tidally locked systems. The latter information will enable empirical tests of WD structure models with finite temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Wind erosion and transport on planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that aeolian (wind blown) processes occur on small, 1 to 100~km diameter, planetesimals when they were embedded in the protosolar nebula. Drag from a headwind within a protostellar disk is sufficiently large to loft cm and smaller sized particles off the surface of a 10 km diameter asteroid in the inner solar system (at a few AU), and micron sized particles off the surface of a 10 km diameter object in the Transneptunian region. The headwind is sufficiently strong to overcome surface cohesion in the inner solar system, but not in the outer solar system. However, in the outer solar system, surface particles can be redistributed or escape due to impacts from particles that are in the protosolar disk's wind. Based on scaling crater ejecta, we estimate that impacts from particles in the headwind will lead to erosion of mass rather than accretion for planetesimals below about 6 km in diameter. The erosion limit is independent of material strength but proportional to the wind velocity. We explore the sensitivity of splash particle trajectories to particle size, headwind velocity and Reynolds number. Winds from a protostellar disk could account for Kuiper Belt Object (486958) Arrokoth's smooth undulating terrain but only during an epoch of high particle flux and low wind velocity. These conditions could have been present during and just after coalescence of Arrokoth's building blocks.</description>

      <title>Spirals, rings, and vortices shaped by shadows in protoplanetary disks: from radiative hydrodynamical simulations to observable signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous protoplanetary disks exhibit shadows in scattered light observations. These shadows are typically cast by misaligned inner disks and are associated with observable structures in the outer disk such as bright arcs and spirals. Investigating the dynamics of the shadowed outer disk is therefore essential in understanding the formation and evolution of these structures. We carry out twodimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations that include radiative diffusion and dust-gas dynamics to study the formation of substructure in shadowed disks. We find that spiral arms are launched at the edge of each shadow, permeating the entire disk. The local dissipation of these spirals results in an angular momentum flux, opening multiple gaps and leading to a series of concentric, regularly-spaced rings We find that ring formation is favored in weakly turbulent disks where dust growth is taking place. These conditions are met for typical class-II disks, in which bright rings should form well within a fraction of their lifetime (0.1-0.2 Myr). For hotter disks gap opening is more efficient, such that the gap edges quickly collapse into vortices that can appear as bright arcs in continuum emission before decaying into rings or merging into massive, long-lived structures. Synthetic observations show that these structures should be observable in scattered light and millimeter continuum emission, providing a new way to probe the presence of substructure in protoplanetary disks. Our results suggest that the formation of rings and gaps is a common process in shadowed disks, and can explain the rich radial substructure observed in several protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Challenges to a sharp change in $G$ as a solution to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the gravitational constant $G$ abruptly decreased around 130 Myr ago, making Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the Hubble flow intrinsically brighter than those in host galaxies with Cepheid distances. This would make Hubble flow SNe more distant, causing redshifts to rise slower with distance, potentially solving the Hubble tension. We explore a wide range of unattractive consequences of this ``$G$ step model'' (GSM). We find that since the luminosities of Sun-like stars scale as approximately $G^{5.6}$, the Solar luminosity would have dropped substantially 130 Myr ago in this scenario, likely pushing Earth into a planetary glaciation. However, there was no Snowball Earth episode in the last 500 Myr. The GSM also implies that the length of a year would have abruptly increased by about 10%, but the number of days per year has evolved broadly continuously according to geochronometry and cyclostratigraphy. The GSM would considerably alter stellar evolution, causing the Sun to have exhausted about 2/3 of its fuel supply rather than 1/2. This would make the Sun's helioseismic age exceed that of the oldest meteorite samples, but these agree excellently in practice. The expected age of the Universe also agrees well with that of the oldest Galactic stars assuming constant $G$. The GSM however implies these stars are younger, creating a lack of stars from the first 3 Gyr of cosmic history. These arguments pose significant challenges to models seeking to resolve the Hubble tension through a transition in $G$.</description>

      <title>Novel Physics of Escaping Secondary Atmospheres May Shape the Cosmic Shoreline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of cool, rocky exoplanets reveal a probable lack of thick atmospheres, suggesting prevalent escape of the secondary atmospheres formed after losing primordial hydrogen. Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS 1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.</description>

      <title>Super-Kamiokande Strongly Constrains Leptophilic Dark Matter Capture in the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun can efficiently capture leptophilic dark matter that scatters with free electrons. If this dark matter subsequently annihilates into leptonic states, it can produce a detectable neutrino flux. Using 10 years of Super-Kamiokande observations, we set constraints on the dark-matter/electron scattering cross-section that exceed terrestrial direct detection searches by more than an order of magnitude for dark matter masses below 100 GeV, and reach cross-sections as low as $\sim$4$\times$10$^{-41}$cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. I. Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Simulating the shaping of point-symmetric structures in the jittering jets explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of core-collapse supernovae by launching several pairs of jets into a collapsing core model and show that the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) can form a point-symmetric morphology that accounts for observed morphologies of about a dozen core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) remnants. Point-symmetric morphologies are composed of pairs of opposite structures around the center of the CCSN remnant. In the JJEM, the newly born neutron star launches several to a few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions, and these jets explode the star. In the simulations with the FLASH numerical code, we launch pairs of jets with varying directions, energies, opening angles, and durations into the massive stellar core and follow their evolution for about two seconds. We show that the jets form pairs of opposite filaments, clumps, bubbles, and lobes, namely, prominent point-symmetric morphologies. The interaction of the jets with the core leads to vigorous Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and excites many vortices, which also shape clumps and filaments. Our results suggest that the JJEM could play a central role in the explosion mechanism of CCSNe; neutrino heating can boost the role of jets.</description>

      <title>Microlensing at Cosmological Distances: Event Rate Predictions in the Warhol Arc of MACS 0416</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly magnified stars ($\mu$ $&gt;$ 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at $z=0.94$) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at $z=0.396)$ where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.</description>
