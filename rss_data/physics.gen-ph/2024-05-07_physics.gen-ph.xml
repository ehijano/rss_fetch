      <title>Tunable Metamaterial Absorber Based on Archimedean Spiral-Shaped Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, the Archimedean spiral structure has been considered as a promising design element in construction for specific purposes and opening up new possibilities in various applications. Its distinctive geometry exhibits a continuous growth pattern with a constant separation between its successive turns. One notable application of the Archimedean spiral structure in metamaterial absorbers is in achieving broadband absorption. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation of a tunable metamaterial absorber with an Archimedean spiral structure in the frequency range of 60 to 600 terahertz. The absorber's absorption spectrum is controlled by temperature variations that induce changes in the conductivity of vanadium dioxide. The absorber is composed of three layers: a bottom layer made of gold, a middle layer consisting of vanadium dioxide, and an upper layer is constructed using a gold cylinder, from which the Archimedean spiral with the same thickness as the gold is subtracted. This research provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of tunable metamaterial absorber.</description>

      <title>Mass-energy equivalence and the gravitational redshift: Does energy always have mass?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most widespread interpretations of the mass-energy equivalence establishes that not only can mass be transformed into energy (e.g., through nuclear fission, fusion, or annihilation) but that every type of energy also has mass (via the mass-energy equivalence formula). Here, we show that this is not always the case. With the help a few thought experiments, we show that, for instance, the electric potential energy of a charged capacitor should not contribute to the capacitor's gravitational rest mass (while still contributing to its linear momentum). That result is in agreement with the fact that light (ultimately, an electromagnetic phenomenon) has momentum but not rest mass.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Einstein's gravitational field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann tensor is the cornerstone of general relativity, but as everyone knows it does not appear explicitly in Einstein's equation of gravitation. This suggests that the latter may not be the most general equation. We propose here for the first time, following a rigorous mathematical treatment based on the variational principle, that there exists a generalized 4-index gravitational field equation containing the Riemann curvature tensor linearly, and thus the Weyl tensor as well. We show that this equation, written in $n$ dimensions, contains the energy-momentum tensor for matter and also that of the gravitational field itself. This new 4-index equation remains completely within the framework of general relativity and emerges as a natural generalization of the familiar 2-index Einstein equation. Due to the presence of the Weyl tensor, we show that this equation contains much more information, which fully justifies the use of a fourth-order theory.</description>

      <title>New bound on the Yukawa coupling from CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the one loop inflation stemming from the superstring theory in the braneworld scenario. The tensor to scalar ratio of the loop inflation is found inconsistent with the recent CMB results for the Yukawa coupling from the SM sector. We propose a new bound on the Yukawa coupling, $9.92&lt;\lambda&lt;13.4$, applicable to the cosmological sector from CMB. The aftermath of this new bound is explored. The present results may shed some light on the phenomenology of superstring theory and its associated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Deflection of Light: A Heuristic Derivation at the Undergraduate Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new heuristic derivation of the gravitational deflection of light around the Sun at the undergraduate level. Instead of solving the geodesic equation directly, we compute the correct deflection angle by focusing on the acceleration term of null geodesics. Using this heuristic deviation, we expect that undergraduate students who have not learned general relativity will be able to experience this computation, which is one of the most remarkable evidences of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Proton Eigenfunctions in Crystalline Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation and Bloch theorem are applied to examine a system of protons confined within a periodic potential, accounting for deviations from ideal harmonic behavior due to real-world conditions like truncated and non-quadratic potentials, in both one-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios. Numerical computation of the energy spectrum of bound eigenfunctions in both cases reveals intriguing structures, including bound states with degeneracy matching the site number $N_w$, reminiscent of a finite harmonic oscillator spectrum. In contrast to electronic energy bands, the proton system displays a greater number of possible bound states due to the significant mass of protons. Extending previous research, this study rigorously determines the constraints on energy gap and oscillation amplitude of the previously identified coherent states. The deviations in energy level spacing identified in the computed spectrum, leading to minor splitting of electromagnetic modes, are analyzed and found not to hinder the onset of coherence. Finally, a more precise value of the energy gap is determined for the proton coherent states, ensuring their stability against thermal decoherence up to the melting temperature of the hosting metal.</description>
