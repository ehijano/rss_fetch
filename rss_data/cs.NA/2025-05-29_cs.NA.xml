      <title>Finite Element Methods for Elastic Contact: Penalty and Nitsche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two methods for treating elastic contact problems with the finite element method; the penalty method and Nitsche's method. For the penalty method we discuss how the penalty parameter should be chosen. Both the theoretical analysis and numerical examples show that an optimal convergence rate cannot be achieved. The method is contrasted to that of Nitsche which is optimally convergent. We also give the derivation of Nitsche's method by a very simple consistency correction of the penalty method.</description>

      <title>Structured Divide-and-Conquer for the Definite Generalized Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast, randomized divide-and-conquer algorithm for the definite generalized eigenvalue problem, which corresponds to pencils $(A,B)$ in which $A$ and $B$ are Hermitian and the Crawford number $\gamma(A,B) = \min_{||x||_2 = 1} |x^H(A+iB)x|$ is positive. Adapted from the fastest known method for diagonalizing arbitrary matrix pencils [Foundations of Computational Mathematics 2024], the algorithm is both inverse-free and highly parallel. As in the general case, randomization takes the form of perturbations applied to the input matrices, which regularize the problem for compatibility with fast, divide-and-conquer eigensolvers -- i.e., the now well-established phenomenon of pseudospectral shattering. We demonstrate that this high-level approach to diagonalization can be executed in a structure-aware fashion by (1) extending pseudospectral shattering to definite pencils under structured perturbations (either random diagonal or sampled from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble) and (2) formulating the divide-and-conquer procedure in a way that maintains definiteness. The result is a specialized solver whose complexity, when applied to definite pencils, is provably lower than that of general divide-and-conquer.</description>

      <title>Locking-Free Training of Physics-Informed Neural Network for Solving Nearly Incompressible Elasticity Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to divergence instability, the accuracy of low-order conforming finite element methods for nearly incompressible homogeneous elasticity equations deteriorates as the Lam\'e coefficient $\lambda\to\infty$, or equivalently as the Poisson ratio $\nu\to1/2$. This phenomenon, known as locking or non-robustness, remains not fully understood despite extensive investigation. In this paper, we propose a robust method based on a fundamentally different, machine-learning-driven approach. Leveraging recently developed Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we address the numerical solution of linear elasticity equations governing nearly incompressible materials. The core idea of our method is to appropriately decompose the given equations to alleviate the extreme imbalance in the coefficients, while simultaneously solving both the forward and inverse problems to recover the solutions of the decomposed systems as well as the associated external conditions. Through various numerical experiments, including constant, variable and parametric Lam\'e coefficients, we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>A High Accuracy Symplectic Scheme for Advection Diffusion Reaction Models in Bioseparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an advection-diffusion-reaction problem with non-homogeneous boundary conditions that models the chromatography process, a vital stage in bioseparation. We prove stability and error estimates for both constant and affine adsorption, using the symplectic one-step implicit midpoint method for time discretization and finite elements for spatial discretization. In addition, we perform the stability analysis for the nonlinear, explicit adsorption in the continuous and semi-discrete cases. For the nonlinear, explicit adsorption, we also complete the error analysis for the semi-discrete case and prove the existence of a solution for the fully discrete case. The numerical tests validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Local cubic spline interpolation for Vlasov-type equations on a multi-patch geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-Lagrangian method for the numerical resolution of Vlasov-type equations on multi-patch meshes. We employ a local cubic spline interpolation with Hermite boundary conditions between the patches. The derivative reconstruction is adapted to cope with non-uniform meshes as well as non-conforming situations. In the conforming case, there are no longer any constraints on the number of points for each patch; however, a small global system must now be solved. In that case, the local spline representations coincide with the corresponding global spline reconstruction. Alternatively, we can choose not to apply the global system and the derivatives can be approximated. The influence of the most distant points diminishes as the number of points per patch increases. For uniform per patch configurations, a study of the explicit and asymptotic behavior of this influence has been led. The method is validated using a two-dimensional guiding-center model with an O-point. All the numerical results are carried out in the Gyselalib++ library.</description>

      <title>Optimized Schwarz methods for heterogeneous heat transfer problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here nonoverlapping optimized Schwarz methods applied to heat transfer problems with heterogeneous diffusion coefficients. After a Laplace transform in time, we derive the error equation and obtain the convergence factor. The optimal transmission operators are nonlocal, and thus inconvenient to use in practice. We introduce three versions of local approximations for the transmission parameter, and provide a detailed analysis at the continuous level in each case to identify the best local transmission conditions. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the performance of each local transmission condition. As shown in our analysis, local transmission conditions, which are scaled appropriately with respect to the heterogeneous diffusion coefficients, are more efficient and robust especially when the discontinuity of the diffusion coefficient is large.</description>

      <title>Direct Algorithms for Reconstructing Small Conductivity Inclusions in Subdiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subdiffusion model that involves a Caputo fractional derivative in time is widely used to describe anomalously slow diffusion processes. In this work we aim at recovering the locations of small conductivity inclusions in the model from boundary measurement, and develop novel direct algorithms based on the asymptotic expansion of the boundary measurement with respect to the size of the inclusions and approximate fundamental solutions. These algorithms involve only algebraic manipulations and are computationally cheap. To the best of our knowledge, they are first direct algorithms for the inverse conductivity problem in the context of the subdiffusion model. Moreover, we provide relevant theoretical underpinnings for the algorithms. Also we present numerical results to illustrate their performance under various scenarios, e.g., the size of inclusions, noise level of the data, and the number of inclusions, showing that the algorithms are efficient and robust.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Hydro-Morphodynamic Model for Sediment Transport using the Moment Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sediment transport is crucial in the hydro-morphodynamic evolution of free surface flows in shallow water environments, which is typically modeled under the shallow water assumption. In classical shallow water modeling for sediment transport, the vertical structure of the flow is collapsed into a depth-averaged and near-bed velocity, usually reconstructed empirically, e.g., using a parameterized logarithmic profile. In practice, large variations from such empirical profiles can occur. It is therefore essential to resolve the vertical structure of the velocity profile within the shallow water framework to better approximate near-bed velocity. This study introduces a model and simulations that incorporate vertical velocity variations and bottom erosion-deposition effects in sediment transport, providing a computationally efficient framework for predicting sediment dynamics in shallow water environments. We employ the so-called moment model approach for the velocity variation, which considers a polynomial expansion of the horizontal velocity in the scaled vertical direction. This allows the use of a complex velocity profile with an extended set of variables determined by the polynomial basis coefficients, resolving the vertical structure as part of the solution. The extended model comprises four components: (1) the standard shallow water equations; (2) moment equations governing evolution of the basis coefficients; (3) an evolution equation for sediment concentration; and (4) a transport equation for the bed. This enables a coupled model for bedload and suspended load transport. We use a hyperbolic regularization technique to ensure model stability and realistic eigenvalues. Several numerical tests, including dam-break cases with and without wet/dry fronts, validate our results against laboratory data.</description>

      <title>Multiprecision computing for multistage fractional physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional physics-informed neural networks (fPINNs) have been successfully introduced in [Pang, Lu and Karniadakis, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 41 (2019) A2603-A2626], which observe relative errors of $10^{-3} \, \sim \, 10^{-4}$ for the subdiffusion equations. However their high-precision (multiprecision) numerical solution remains challenging, due to the limited regularity of the subdiffusion model caused by the nonlocal operator. To fill in the gap, we present the multistage fPINNs based on traditional multistage PINNs [Wang and Lai, J. Comput. Phys. 504 (2024) 112865]. Numerical experiments show that the relative errors improve to $10^{-7} \, \sim \, 10^{-8}$ for the subdiffusion equations on uniform or nouniform meshes.</description>

      <title>Lanczos with compression for symmetric matrix Lyapunov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers large-scale Lyapunov matrix equations of the form $AX + XA = \boldsymbol{c}\boldsymbol{c}^T$, where $A$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix and $\boldsymbol{c}$ is a vector. Motivated by the need to solve such equations in a wide range of applications, various numerical methods have been developed to compute low-rank approximations of the solution matrix $X$. In this work, we focus on the Lanczos method, which has the distinct advantage of requiring only matrix-vector products with $A$, making it broadly applicable. However, the Lanczos method may suffer from slow convergence when $A$ is ill-conditioned, leading to excessive memory requirements for storing the Krylov subspace basis generated by the algorithm. To address this issue, we propose a novel compression strategy for the Krylov subspace basis that significantly reduces memory usage without hindering convergence. This is supported by both numerical experiments and a convergence analysis. Our analysis also accounts for the loss of orthogonality due to round-off errors in the Lanczos process.</description>

      <title>Gautschi-type and implicit-explicit integrators for constrained wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the construction and analysis of two integrators for (semi-linear) second-order partial differential-algebraic equations of semi-explicit type. More precisely, we consider an implicit-explicit Crank-Nicolson scheme as well as an exponential integrator of Gautschi type. For this, well-known wave integrators for unconstrained systems are combined with techniques known from the field of differential-algebraic equations. The result are efficient time stepping schemes, which are provable of second order. Moreover, we discuss the practical implementation of the Gautschi-type method, which involves the solution of certain saddle point problems. The theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments for the the wave equation with kinetic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A hybrid PDE-ABM model for angiogenesis and tumour microenvironment with application to resistance in cancer treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main obstacle to effective cancer treatment is the development of drug resistance, which can be divided into two categories: spontaneous and acquired drug resistance. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. A subset of lung cancer, adenocarcinomas, is characterised by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Treatment of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinomas has become less effective over time due to drug resistance development, which is associated with a second mutation in the EGFR gene. An important factor in the development of cancer is angiogenesis, which is the formation of blood vessels from the existing vasculature. These newly formed blood vessels provide oxygen and nutrients to tumour cells to maintain tumour growth and proliferation. We applied a hybrid discrete-continuous (HDC) model to capture the dynamic vasculature in the tumour microenvironment (TME). In the case of pre-existing resistance, the formation of angiogenic networks creates a microenvironment that supports tumour survival and enhances drug resistance. In the case of spontaneous mutation-induced resistance, earlier and more frequent mutations confer a greater survival advantage to the tumour population. There is also a mutually reinforcing relationship between a high proliferation rate and high resistance characteristics. These findings explain two conflicting experimental results about the second mutation in NSCLC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical method for the initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) of first-order hyperbolic systems with source terms. The scheme directly solves the relaxation system using a relatively coarse mesh and captures the equilibrium behavior quite well, even in the presence of boundary layers. This method extends the concept of asymptotic-preserving schemes from initial-value problems to IBVPs. Moreover, we apply this idea to design a unified numerical scheme for the interface problem of relaxation systems.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning transformations of adjoint systems for evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust control and optimization in high-fidelity physics simulations is extremely challenging, especially for evolutionary systems whose solutions span vast scales across space, time, and physical variables. In conjunction with gradient-based methods, adjoint systems are widely used in the optimization of systems subject to differential equation constraints. In optimization, gradient-based methods are often transformed using suitable preconditioners to accelerate the convergence of the optimization algorithm. Inspired by preconditioned gradient descent methods, we introduce a framework for the preconditioning of adjoint systems associated to evolution equations, which allows one to reshape the dynamics of the adjoint system. We develop two classes of adjoint preconditioning transformations: those that transform both the state dynamics and the adjoint equation and those that transform only the adjoint equation while leaving the state dynamics invariant. Both classes of transformations have the flexibility to include generally nonlinear state-dependent transformations. Using techniques from symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics, we further show that these preconditioned adjoint systems preserve the property that the adjoint system backpropagates the derivative of an objective function. We then apply this framework to the setting of coupled evolution equations, where we develop a notion of scale preconditioning of the adjoint equations when the state dynamics exhibit large scale-separation. We demonstrate the proposed scale preconditioning on an inverse problem for the radiation diffusion equations. Naive gradient descent is unstable for any practical gradient descent step size, whereas our proposed scale-preconditioned adjoint descent converges in 10-15 gradient-based optimization iterations, with highly accurate reproduction of the wavefront at the final time.</description>

      <title>PADAM: Parallel averaged Adam reduces the error for stochastic optimization in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Averaging techniques such as Ruppert--Polyak averaging and exponential movering averaging (EMA) are powerful approaches to accelerate optimization procedures of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods such as the popular ADAM optimizer. However, depending on the specific optimization problem under consideration, the type and the parameters for the averaging need to be adjusted to achieve the smallest optimization error. In this work we propose an averaging approach, which we refer to as parallel averaged ADAM (PADAM), in which we compute parallely different averaged variants of ADAM and during the training process dynamically select the variant with the smallest optimization error. A central feature of this approach is that this procedure requires no more gradient evaluations than the usual ADAM optimizer as each of the averaged trajectories relies on the same underlying ADAM trajectory and thus on the same underlying gradients. We test the proposed PADAM optimizer in 13 stochastic optimization and deep neural network (DNN) learning problems and compare its performance with known optimizers from the literature such as standard SGD, momentum SGD, Adam with and without EMA, and ADAMW. In particular, we apply the compared optimizers to physics-informed neural network, deep Galerkin, deep backward stochastic differential equation and deep Kolmogorov approximations for boundary value partial differential equation problems from scientific machine learning, as well as to DNN approximations for optimal control and optimal stopping problems. In nearly all of the considered examples PADAM achieves, sometimes among others and sometimes exclusively, essentially the smallest optimization error. This work thus strongly suggest to consider PADAM for scientific machine learning problems and also motivates further research for adaptive averaging procedures within the training of DNNs.</description>

      <title>Discrete stochastic maximal regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete regularity estimates for a broad class of temporal numerical schemes for parabolic stochastic evolution equations. We provide a characterization of discrete stochastic maximal $\ell^p$-regularity in terms of its continuous counterpart, thereby establishing a unified framework that yields numerous new discrete regularity results. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous-time theory, we establish several important properties of discrete stochastic maximal regularity such as extrapolation in the exponent $p$ and with respect to a power weight. Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models for PDE-Constrained Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages, including the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse solutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems, particularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, diffusion models only access noisy data $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate steps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are typically applied to the expectation of clean samples $\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}_0|\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the learned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation does not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's Gap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the cost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are not injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a post-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only facilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also support both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from randomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over several recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and ECI-sampling, with less computation overhead. Our approach can shed light on more efficient and effective strategies for incorporating physical constraints into diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization Strategies for the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz in Noisy Quantum Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22398v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a benchmark of eight optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the tVHA, evaluating performance on $H_2$, $H_4$, and $LiH$ (in both full and active spaces) under noiseless and sampling noise conditions. Sampling noise fundamentally alters optimizer behavior, with gradient-based methods performing best in ideal conditions, while population-based algorithms, such as CMA-ES, show greater resilience under noise. Hartree-Fock initialization reduces the number of function evaluations by 27-60% and consistently yields higher final accuracy compared to random starting points. We identify a precision limit set by sampling noise, with diminishing returns beyond approximately 1000 shots.</description>

      <title>Continuity and approximability of competitive spectral radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competitive spectral radius extends the notion of joint spectral radius to the two-player case: two players alternatively select matrices in prescribed compact sets, resulting in an infinite matrix product; one player wishes to maximize the growth rate of this product, whereas the other player wishes to minimize it. We show that when the matrices represent linear operators preserving a cone and satisfying a "strict positivity" assumption, the competitive spectral radius depends continuously - and even in a Lipschitz-continuous way - on the matrix sets. Moreover, we show that the competive spectral radius can be approximated up to any accuracy. This relies on the solution of a discretized infinite dimensional non-linear eigenproblem. We illustrate the approach with an example of age-structured population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid High-Order formulations with turbulence modelling capabilities for incompressible flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, that is well suited to be employed for the simulation of turbulent flows. The spatial discretization relies on hybrid velocity and pressure spaces and the temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive features that can be fruitfully exploited when high-fidelity computations are required, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of mass enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the inviscid limit, implicit high-order accurate time stepping with local time step adaptation, reduced memory footprint thanks to static condensation of both velocity and pressure, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. After demonstrating the relevant properties of the scheme in practice, performing challenging 2D and 3D test cases, we consider the simulation of the Taylor--Green Vortex flow problem at Reynolds 1600.</description>

      <title>Superiority Of Symplectic Methods For Stochastic Hamiltonian System Via Asymptotic Error Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superiority of symplectic methods for stochastic Hamiltonian systems has been widely recognized, yet the probabilistic mechanism behind this superiority remains incompletely understood. This paper studies the superiority of symplectic methods from the perspective of the asymptotic error distribution, i.e., the limit distribution of normalized error. Focusing on stochastic Hamiltonian systems driven by additive noise, we obtain the asymptotic limit of the normalized error distribution of the $\theta$ method $(\theta\in[0,1])$ that is symplectic if and only if $\theta=\frac12$. By establishing upper bounds for the second-order moment of the asymptotic error distribution, we show that the midpoint method minimizes the error constant of the $\theta$ method for a large time horizon $T$. Furthermore, we take the linear stochastic oscillator as a test equation and investigate exact asymptotic error constants of several symplectic and non-symplectic methods. Our result suggests that in the long-time computation, the probability that the error deviates from zero decays exponentially faster for the symplectic methods than that for the non-symplectic ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove convergence rates of linear sampling recovery of functions in abstract Bochner spaces satisfying weighted summability of their generalized polynomial chaos expansion coefficients. The underlying algorithm is a function-valued extension of the least squares method widely used and thoroughly studied in scalar-valued function recovery. We apply our theory to collocation approximation of solutions to parametric elliptic or parabolic PDEs with log-normal random inputs and to relevant approximation of infinite dimensional holomorphic functions on $\mathbb R^\infty$. The application allows us to significantly improve known results in Computational Uncertainty Quantification for these problems. Our results are also applicable for parametric PDEs with affine inputs, where they match the known rates.</description>

      <title>Some lower bounds for optimal sampling recovery of functions with mixed smoothness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there was a substantial progress in the problem of sampling recovery on function classes with mixed smoothness. Mostly, it has been done by proving new and sometimes optimal upper bounds for both linear sampling recovery and for nonlinear sampling recovery. In this paper we address the problem of lower bounds for the optimal rates of nonlinear sampling recovery.
  In the case of linear recovery one can use the well developed theory of estimating the Kolmogorov and linear widths for establishing some lower bounds for the optimal rates. In the case of nonlinear recovery we cannot use the above approach. It seems like the only technique, which is available now, is based on some simple observations. We demonstrate how these observations can be used.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Singular Value Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition is widely used in modal analysis, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and resolvent analysis, to extract key features from complex problems. SVD derivatives need to be computed efficiently to enable the large scale design optimization. However, for a general complex matrix, no method can accurately compute this derivative to machine precision and remain scalable with respect to the number of design variables without requiring the all of the singular variables. We propose two algorithms to efficiently compute this derivative based on the adjoint method and reverse automatic differentiation and RAD-based singular value derivative formula. Differentiation results for each method proposed were compared with FD results for one square and one tall rectangular matrix example and matched with the FD results to about 5 to 7 digits. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method by calculating the derivatives of singular values with respect to the snapshot matrix derived from the POD of a large dataset for a laminar-turbulent transitional flow over a flat plate, sourced from the John Hopkins turbulence database.</description>

      <title>Maxwell \`a la Helmholtz: Electromagnetic scattering by 3D perfect electric conductors via Helmholtz integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of indirect boundary integral equation (BIE) formulations for the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems involving smooth perfectly electric conductors (PECs) in three-dimensions. These combined-field-type BIE formulations rely exclusively on classical Helmholtz boundary operators, resulting in provably well-posed, frequency-robust, Fredholm second-kind BIEs. Notably, we prove that the proposed formulations are free from spurious resonances, while retaining the versatility of Helmholtz integral operators. The approach is based on the equivalence between the Maxwell PEC scattering problem and two independent vector Helmholtz boundary value problems for the electric and magnetic fields, with boundary conditions defined in terms of the Dirichlet and Neumann traces of the corresponding vector Helmholtz solutions. While certain aspects of this equivalence (for the electric field) have been previously exploited in the so-called field-only BIE formulations, we here rigorously establish and generalize the equivalence between Maxwell and Helmholtz problems for both fields. Finally, a variety of numerical examples highlights the robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach when combined with Density Interpolation-based Nystr\"om methods and fast linear algebra solvers, implemented in the open-source Julia package Inti$.$jl.</description>

      <title>An Operator-Splitting Scheme for Viscosity Solutions of Constrained Second-Order PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a novel operator-splitting scheme for approximating viscosity solutions of constrained second-order partial differential equations (PDEs) with low-regularity solutions in \( C(\overline{\Omega}_T) \cap H^1(\Omega_T) \). By decoupling PDE evolution and constraint enforcement, the scheme leverages stabilized finite elements and implicit Euler time-stepping to ensure consistency, stability, and monotonicity, guaranteeing convergence to the unique viscosity solution via the Barles-Souganidis framework. The method supports vector-valued constraints and unstructured meshes, addressing challenges in traditional approaches such as restrictive stability conditions and ill-conditioned systems. Theoretical analysis demonstrates a convergence rate of \( O(h^{1-\epsilon}) \) with a proper chosen time step. Applications to Hamilton-Jacobi equations, reaction-diffusion systems, and two-phase Navier-Stokes flows highlight the scheme's versatility and robustness, positioning it as a significant advancement in numerical methods for constrained nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Solving FBSDEs and their Associated Semilinear Elliptic PDEs with Small Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forward-backwards stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) play an important role in optimal control, game theory, economics, mathematical finance, and in reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, the available FBSDE solvers operate on \textit{individual} FBSDEs, meaning that they cannot provide a computationally feasible strategy for solving large families of FBSDEs, as these solvers must be re-run several times. \textit{Neural operators} (NOs) offer an alternative approach for \textit{simultaneously solving} large families of decoupled FBSDEs by directly approximating the solution operator mapping \textit{inputs:} terminal conditions and dynamics of the backwards process to \textit{outputs:} solutions to the associated FBSDE. Though universal approximation theorems (UATs) guarantee the existence of such NOs, these NOs are unrealistically large. Upon making only a few simple theoretically-guided tweaks to the standard convolutional NO build, we confirm that ``small'' NOs can uniformly approximate the solution operator to structured families of FBSDEs with random terminal time, uniformly on suitable compact sets determined by Sobolev norms using a logarithmic depth, a constant width, and a polynomial rank in the reciprocal approximation error.
  This result is rooted in our second result, and main contribution to the NOs for PDE literature, showing that our convolutional NOs of similar depth and width but grow only \textit{quadratically} (at a dimension-free rate) when uniformly approximating the solution operator of the associated class of semilinear Elliptic PDEs to these families of FBSDEs. A key insight into how NOs work we uncover is that the convolutional layers of our NO can approximately implement the fixed point iteration used to prove the existence of a unique solution to these semilinear Elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Message-Passing GNNs Fail to Approximate Sparse Triangular Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed as a tool for learning sparse matrix preconditioners, which are key components in accelerating linear solvers. This position paper argues that message-passing GNNs are fundamentally incapable of approximating sparse triangular factorizations. We demonstrate that message-passing GNNs fundamentally fail to approximate sparse triangular factorizations for classes of matrices for which high-quality preconditioners exist but require non-local dependencies. To illustrate this, we construct a set of baselines using both synthetic matrices and real-world examples from the SuiteSparse collection. Across a range of GNN architectures, including Graph Attention Networks and Graph Transformers, we observe severe performance degradation compared to exact or K-optimal factorizations, with cosine similarity dropping below $0.6$ in key cases. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that architectural innovations beyond message-passing are necessary for applying GNNs to scientific computing tasks such as matrix factorization. Experiments demonstrate that overcoming non-locality alone is insufficient. Tailored architectures are necessary to capture the required dependencies since even a completely non-local Graph Transformer fails to match the proposed baselines.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Logarithmic Fekete Critical Configurations of at Most Six Points in All Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the logarithmic Fekete problem, which consists of placing a fixed number of points on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, in such a way that the product of all pairs of mutual Euclidean distances is maximized or, equivalently, so that their logarithmic energy is minimized. Using tools from Computational Algebraic Geometry, we find and classify all critical configurations for this problem when considering at most six points in every dimension $d$. In particular, our approach gives new proofs of several key results appearing in the literature, with the benefit of using a unified approach.</description>

      <title>Arnold Diffusion in the Full Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full three-body problem, on the motion of three celestial bodies under their mutual gravitational attraction, is one of the oldest unsolved problems in classical mechanics. The main difficulty comes from the presence of unstable and chaotic motions, which make long-term prediction impossible. In this paper, we show that the full three-body problem exhibits a strong form of instability known as Arnold diffusion. We consider the planar full three-body problem, formulated as a perturbation of both the Kepler problem and the planar circular restricted three-body problem. We show that the system exhibits Arnold diffusion, in the sense that there is a transfer of energy -- of an amount independent of the perturbation parameter -- between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on the topological method of correctly aligned windows, which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. We demonstrate that the approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, choosing a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system as an example. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>
