      <title>Microscopic mechanisms of Strong Electron Scattering and Giant Anomalous Hall Effect in high-Curie-temperature Fe3GaTe2 van der Waals Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 with room-temperature perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and strong anomalous Hall effect has attracted considerable interest for their potential in spintronics. However, the microscopic mechanisms and manipulation of the electron scattering and the anomalous Hall effect of Fe3GaTe2 have remained unsettled. Here, we demonstrate strong tuning of the electron scattering and anomalous Hall effect of pattern-defined Fe3GaTe2 Hall-bar devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, high Curie temperature (340 K, as high as that of Fe3GaTe2 bulk), and giant anomalous Hall effect by varying the layer thickness and temperature. Temperature-dependent resistivity experiments reveal that the electron scattering of the high-quality Fe3GaTe2 is dominated by impurity scattering and phonon scattering, regardless of the thickness. Combined temperature- and thickness-dependent scaling analyses of the anomalous Hall resistivity reveal that the anomalous Hall effect of the Fe3GaTe2 is predominantly from the positive, temperature-independent skew-scattering contribution that competes with negative temperature-independent, side-jump contribution, and negative, temperature-dependent intrinsic Berry-curvature contribution. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity decreases rapidly with increasing impurity scattering, which is consistent with the characteristic variation of intrinsic Hall conductivities in the dirty-metal regime. These findings advance the understanding of electron scattering and the anomalous Hall effect in van der Waals magnets and would benefit the application of the Fe3GaTe2 in spintronics.</description>

      <title>First-Principles and Machine Learning Investigation of the Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Dodecaphenylyne: A Novel Carbon Allotrope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the computational discovery and characterization of Dodecaphenylyne (DP), a novel carbon allotrope with a distinctive geometric arrangement. DP structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties were evaluated using density functional theory and a machine learning interatomic potential trained explicitly for this material. The formation energy of -7.98 eV/atom indicates high thermodynamic stability, further supported by the absence of imaginary phonon modes and the preservation of structural integrity up to 1000 K in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Mechanical analysis reveals high in-plane stiffness with directional dependence: Young's modulus values of 469.09 GPa and 600.41 GPa along the x and y directions, respectively. Electronic band structure and projected density of states analyses confirm the DP semiconducting character. Calculations of carrier mobility using the deformation potential theory reveal pronounced anisotropy, with maximum values reaching up to $30.6 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s (electrons, e) and $8.4 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s (holes, h), much higher than the observed for other 2D materials. DP also exhibits anisotropic optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum, highlighting its potential for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Sodium-Decorated P-C3N: A Porous 2D Framework for High-Capacity and Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of reversible hydrogen storage materials has become crucial for enabling carbon-neutral energy systems. Based on this, the present work investigates the hydrogen storage on the sodium-decorated P-C$_3$N (Na@P-C$_3$N), a porous carbon nitride monolayer recently proposed as a stable semiconductor. First-principles calculations reveal that Na atoms preferentially adsorb with an adsorption energy of -4.48~eV, effectively suppressing clusterization effects. Upon decoration, the system becomes metallic, while \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations confirm the thermal stability of Na@P-C$_3$N at 300~K. Hydrogen adsorption on Na@P-C$_3$N occurs through weak physisorption, with energies ranging from -0.18 to -0.28~eV, and desorption temperatures between 231 and 357~K. The system can stably absorb 16 H$_2$ molecules per unit cell, corresponding to a gravimetric storage capacity of 9.88~wt\%, surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy target. These results demonstrate that Na@P-C$_3$N is a promising candidate for lightweight, stable, and reversible hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>OLi3-decorated Irida-graphene for High-capacity Hydrogen Storage: A First-principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient hydrogen storage in solid-state materials is essential for next-generation energy systems, yet achieving a high gravimetric capacity with optimal adsorption characteristics remains a critical challenge. Although Li-decorated irida-graphene (IG) has shown promising hydrogen storage potential, its capacity is limited to $\sim$ 7wt\%, which, despite exceeding the U.S. DOE target, remains inadequate for large-scale applications. Additionally, Li clustering over extended cycles may compromise adsorption efficiency and structural stability. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the hydrogen storage potential of IG decorated with superalkali OLi$_3$ clusters, aiming to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability for advanced hydrogen storage technologies. Our findings show that the OLi$_3$ clusters exhibit a significant binding energy of -3.24 eV, which highlights its strong interaction with the IG. OLi$_3$@IG complex can host up to 12H$_2$ molecules, with optimal maximum storage capacity of 10.00 wt\%. Additionally, the release temperature (T$_R$) and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate that H$_2$ molecules can be efficiently released at operating temperatures under ambient conditions. These results highlight the potential of OLi$_3$-decorated irida-graphene as a promising candidate for reversible hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Mechanisms of Thermal Transport in Vacancy-Defective Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding heat conduction in defective silicon is crucial for electronics and thermoelectrics. Conventional understanding relies on phonon gas picture, treating defects as scattering centers that reduce phonon lifetimes without altering frequencies and group velocities. We go beyond phonon gas picture by employing Wigner transport equation to investigate heat conduction in vacancy-defected silicon. Our findings reveal that while thermal conduction in pristine silicon stems mainly from particle-like propagation of vibrational modes, wave-like tunnelling becomes increasingly significant in the presence of vacancies. Contrary to the conventional belief that defects only perturb mode lifetimes, we demonstrate that vacancies also diminish velocity operators, a dominant factor in thermal conductivity reduction, surpassing even the effect of lifetime shortening. Furthermore, incorporating anharmonic frequencies and interatomic force constants shows that while anharmonicity suppresses thermal conductivity in pristine silicon, this effect weakens with vacancy concentration and reverses to enhance conductivity. These findings challenge conventional knowledge and provide new insights into thermal conduction in defective materials.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the wavefunction of magnetic topological insulators MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 using spin-resolved photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their importance for exotic quantum effects, the surface electronic structure of magnetic topological insulators MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 remains poorly understood. Using high-efficiency spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we directly image the spin-polarization and orbital character of the surface states in both compounds and map our observations onto a model wavefunction to describe the complex spin-orbital texture, which solidifies our understanding of the surface band structure by establishing the single-band nature of the most prominent states. Most importantly, our analysis reveals a new mechanism for reducing the magnetic gap of the topological surface states based on the orbital composition of the wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Universal band center model for the HER activity of non-metal site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the hydrogen evolution reaction activities of non-metal sites in the transition metal dichalcogenides with the stoichiometry of MX2 are investigated using the first principles calculations. The trained machine learning model demonstrates that the pz band center, bandgap, and period effect are the key factors influencing the HER activity of MX2. Furthermore, it also reveals that the observed non-scaling law between the pz band center and HER activity in the semiconductor-like materials originates from the bandgap-induced downshift of bonding and antibonding states. In addition to the bandgap, the intrinsic p orbital energy level of the non-metal atoms also contributes to the periodic variation of pz band center. Extended calculations indicate that the descriptor is equally applicable to the other catalysts, suggesting its universality in predicting the HER activity of non-metal sites.</description>

      <title>Long-range electrical conductivity in non-$\pi$-conjugated organic molecular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic conductivity in organic materials is well-established. Moreover, semiconductive or metallic behavior in (quasi) 0-, 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional carbon-based materials has been demonstrated and understood and is nowadays widely applied in commercial devices. Despite the large structural variety, these materials commonly have an extended $\pi$-system, formed by sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which is responsible for the conductivity. Here, we present a class of organic molecular materials that, despite the absence of an extended $\pi$-system, show a distinct direct current conductivity in quasi-1D supramolecular stacks of small organic molecules. Long-range conductivity takes place by removal of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital, i.e. oxidation, followed by charge transfer between neighboring molecules. In thin-film devices, the resulting transport band becomes energetically accessible to charges from the contacts by interfacial dipoles stemming from a dipolar group in the molecule. Long-range order in the form of the supramolecular polymers with lengths exceeding several micrometers enhances the macroscopic conductivity but is not essential. The results presented herein show a new way to incorporate electronic functionality in organic materials and present a new class of organic conductors that lack the extended $\pi$-electron-system of conventional organic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Probing the semiconductor-to-dirac semimetal transition in Na-Sb-Bi alloys with x-ray Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss electron redistribution during the Semiconductor-to-Dirac Semimetal transition in Na-Sb-Bi alloys using x-ray Compton scattering experiments combined with first-principles electronic structure modeling. A robust signature of the semiconductor-to-Dirac semimetal transition is identified in the spherically averaged Compton profile. We demonstrate how the number of electrons involved in this transition can be estimated to provide a novel descriptor for quantifying the strength of spin-orbit coupling responsible for driving the transition. The associated theoretical deviation of the Born charge of Na in Na$_3$Bi from the expected ionic charge of +1 is found to be consistent with the corresponding experimental value of about 10%. Our study also shows the sensitivity of the Compton scattering technique toward capturing the spillover of Bi 6p relativistic states onto Na sites.</description>

      <title>Understanding Stability Mechanisms in Single-Atom Alloys with Theory-infused Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interpretable deep learning model that enhances the prediction of cohesive energy in transition metal alloys (TMAs) by incorporating cohesion theory into a graph neural network (GNN) framework. The model not only predicts the total cohesive energy-an indicator of crystal stability-but also disentangles its various contributing factors and underlying physical parameters. The physics insights extracted from the model clarify the stability trends of transition metal surfaces across the periodic table. Furthermore, by applying the model to single-atom alloys (SAAs), a class of catalytically significant next-generation TMAs, we analyze and explain the relative stability of monomer/dimer (in-plane symmetry breaking) and top-/sub-layer (out-of-plane symmetry breaking) configurations. These two types of symmetry breaking lead to distinct thermodynamic preferences in SAAs, governed by localized effects (e.g. d-orbital coupling) and delocalized effects (e.g. wavefunction renormalization). The model is thus positioned as a powerful tool for understanding and strategically designing TMAs, enabling the tailored development of materials with improved stability for advanced applications in catalysis and materials science.</description>

      <title>Crack Path Prediction with Operator Learning using Discrete Particle System data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained on 32 to 45 samples, using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Luminescence thermometry based on time gates: highly sensitive approach for real time sensing and imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, one of the most significant advantages of luminescence thermometry is its ability to be used not only for spot temperature measurements but also for imaging temperature changes. Among the commonly proposed approaches, luminescence thermometry based on luminescence kinetics holds particular promise. However, most thermometric studies rely on the analysis of luminescence decay profiles, a method that significantly hinders, if not entirely precludes, real-time thermal imaging. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on the luminescence intensity ratio integrated over two temporal gates. Tests conducted on two representative phosphors, Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+, demonstrate that the proposed method not only enables thermal imaging but also achieves substantially higher relative sensitivity, reaching SR=17.1 % K-1 for Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and SR=9.4 % K-1 for Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+, compared to the conventional lifetime-based approach (SR=4.2 % K-1 for Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and SR=1.2 % K-1 for Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+). Furthermore, careful selection of gate lengths allows optimization of the thermometric performance of the proposed luminescent thermometers. This approach enables expansion of the thermal operating range at the cost of relative sensitivity, providing versatility to adapt the thermometer for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Re-experiment Smart: a Novel Method to Enhance Data-driven Prediction of Mechanical Properties of Epoxy Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density ($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net, SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the dataset to be re-measured.These findings highlight the importance of data quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive reliability in materials science.</description>

      <title>DistMLIP: A Distributed Inference Platform for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional space-partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that existing foundational potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnon band topology and associated topological edge states (TESs) in Neel-type ferromagnetic skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, using parameters relevant to monolayer CrI3. Employing stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and discrete Holstein-Primakoff bosonization, we analyze the impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice structure on the magnonic spectrum, in contrast to the extensively studied triangular spin-lattice SkXs. Our analysis identifies topological features unique to the honeycomb lattice. In particular, certain characteristic magnon modes (e.g., elliptical distortion and triangular distortion modes) acquire nontrivial Chern numbers absent in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, contrary to predictions based on triangular spin-lattice SkXs, we find that the counterclockwise (CCW)-breathing magnonic gap exhibits topological behavior only at large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI), losing its universality with decreasing DMI strength. Meanwhile, the second magnon gap consistently hosts robust TESs across the entire range of DMI and magnetic fields studied, closing at critical fields through field-induced topological phase transitions. The study further uncovers a remarkable richness in the magnon topology, identifying 65 distinct topological magnon phases generated by magnetic-field-driven skyrmion deformation. These findings underscore the profound role of lattice geometry in shaping magnon topology in non-collinear spin textures.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale mapping of interfacial phonon modes in epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} / (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 thin films: The role of surface phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of phonons at the epitaxial interface between YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} thin film and (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 substrate using vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy. Interfacial phonon modes with different degrees of scattering localization were identified. We find evidence that surface contributions from the surrounding environment can impose additional scattering modulation into local EELS measurements at the interface. A method to remove those contributions is then used to isolate the phonon information at the interface. This work unveils interfacial phonon modes in a high-Tc cuprate superconductor, that are not accessible with traditional phonon spectroscopy techniques, and provides a method for probing interfacial phonons in complex oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Emergent rigidity percolation of five-fold aggregates enables controllable glass properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses possess outstanding mechanical and physical properties, making them promising candidates for advanced structural and functional applications; however, the lack of understanding and control over their glass transition and solidification processes remains a significant barrier to practical design. The glass transition from liquid to amorphous solid has remained an open problem in physics despite many theories and recent advances in computational efforts. The question of identifying a clear and well-defined diverging length scale accompanying the glass transition has remained unanswered, as has the nature of the transition and, indeed, the presence of a transition at all, as opposed to a mere dynamical crossover. Here we answer these questions using numerical results and theoretical analysis showing that, in atomic (metallic) glass formers, the glass transition coincides with, and is caused by, a continuous rigidity percolation transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like material. The transition occurs as five-fold symmetric atomic clusters progressively aggregate, forming a system-spanning rigid network that marks the onset of mechanical stability. This percolation-driven rigidity growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in the shear modulus G', indicating the emergence of macroscopic solid-like behavior. Beyond this point, which coincides with the Maxwell isostatic point of the percolating structure, dynamical arrest or "freezing-in" prevents further evolution. The long-sought diverging length scale is thus identified as the percolation-driven growth of rigid five-fold clusters, providing a direct link between local structural motifs and macroscopic mechanical properties at the glass transition. These insights offer practical routes to rationally engineer metallic glasses with targeted mechanical stiffness, hardness, and toughness.</description>

      <title>Chaotic magnetization dynamics in magnetic Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a magnetic analogy of the Duffing oscillator--magnetic Duffing oscillator--which is characterized by a double-well magnetic potential of a ferromagnet with a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Based on the linear stability analysis of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the magnetic anisotropy field creates an anharmonicity on the magnetic potential, generating homoclinic orbits in the phase space. By evaluating the Lyapunov exponent, we demonstrate that the magnetic Duffing oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviors in the presence of periodically oscillating external forces: Oersted field and spin-orbit torque by considering the ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer. We also show that the external magnetic field can be adjusted to generate or modify homoclinic orbits, thereby controlling the parameter range of the oscillating external forces that induce chaos. This work deepens our understanding of chaotic magnetization dynamics by bridging the fields of nonlinear dynamics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>A mesoscale phase-field model of intergranular liquid lithium corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phase-field model is developed to simulate intergranular corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels exposed to liquid lithium. The chromium concentration of the material is used to track the mass transport within the metal and liquid (corrosive) phase. The framework naturally captures intergranular corrosion by enhancing the diffusion of chromium along grain boundaries relative to the grain bulk with no special treatment for the corrosion front evolution. The formulation applies to arbitrary 2D and 3D polycrystalline geometries. The framework reproduces experimental measurements of weight loss and corrosion depth for a 9 wt\% Cr ferritic/martensitic steel exposed to static lithium at 600 $^\circ$C. A sensitivity analysis, varying near-surface grain density, grain size, and chromium depletion thickness, highlights the microstructural influence in the corrosion process. Moreover, the significance of saturation is considered and evaluated. Simulation results show that near-surface grain density is a deciding factor, whereas grain size dictates the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations of charge density wave order across the transition in 2H-NbSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs) involve coupled amplitude and phase degrees of freedom, but direct access to local amplitude correlations remains experimentally challenging. Here, we report cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) measurements of CDW ordering in 2H-NbSe2, enabled by liquid helium-based cooling down to 20 K. By mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution and analyzing their autocorrelations, we extract the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter, independent of global phase coherence. Our results reveal that weak short-range amplitude correlations persist above the transition temperature, and grow significantly upon cooling, reaching approximately 150 nm at 20 K. These findings demonstrate clear deviations from mean-field expectations and establish 4D-STEM as a powerful tool for probing spatially inhomogeneous electronic order in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected electronic metastability in an optically driven cuprate ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically excited quantum materials exhibit nonequilibrium states with remarkable emergent properties, but these phenomena are usually transient, decaying on picosecond timescales and limiting practical applications. Advancing the design and control of nonequilibrium phases requires the development of targeted strategies to achieve long-lived, metastable phases. Here, we report the discovery of symmetry-protected electronic metastability in the model cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Using femtosecond resonant x-ray scattering and spectroscopy, we show that this metastability is driven by a transfer of holes from chain-like charge reservoirs into the ladders. This ultrafast charge redistribution arises from the optical dressing and activation of a hopping pathway that is forbidden by symmetry at equilibrium. Relaxation back to the ground state is hence suppressed after the pump coherence dissipates. Our findings highlight how dressing materials with electromagnetic fields can dynamically activate terms in the electronic Hamiltonian, and provide a rational design strategy for nonequilibrium phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic band structure is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science. Conventional methods like Wannier interpolation (WI), which are commonly used to interpolate band structures onto dense k-point grids, often encounter difficulties with complex systems, such as those involving entangled bands or topological obstructions. We introduce the Hamiltonian transformation (HT) method, a novel framework that enhances interpolation accuracy by localizing the Hamiltonian. Using a pre-optimized transformation, HT produces a far more localized Hamiltonian than WI-SCDM (where Wannier functions are generated via the selected columns of the density matrix projection), achieving up to two orders of magnitude greater accuracy for entangled bands. Although HT utilizes a slightly larger, nonlocal numerical basis set, its construction is rapid and requires no optimization, resulting in significant computational speedups. These features make HT a more precise, efficient, and robust alternative to WI-SCDM for band structure interpolation, as verified by high-throughput calculations.</description>

      <title>Integrative Mobility Model For Grain-Boundary-Limited Transport In Thermoelectric Compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain-boundary-limited charge transport remains a key bottleneck in polycrystalline thermoelectric materials, where reduced carrier mobility degrades electrical conductivity and suppresses the power factor. Here we present a semi-empirical mobility model that integrates three dominant grain-boundary mechanisms: (i) weighted mobility linked to carrier effective mass and concentration, (ii) thermionic emission across grain-boundary barriers, and (iii) geometric suppression arising from a finite mean free path ($\ell$). The model is validated against a diverse set of polycrystalline thermoelectric materials -- including Bi$_2$Te$_3$, PbTe, Mg$_2$Si, and SnSe -- showing excellent agreement with experiment ($R^2 = 0.93$--0.99) and yielding physically consistent parameters: $0 \lesssim \Phi_{\mathrm{GB}} \lesssim 0.15$ eV and $\ell \approx 15$--60 nm. The model captures the non-monotonic mobility trends produced by the interplay between barrier activation and phonon scattering. We further apply the model to Al-doped ZnO, revealing that combined grain-boundary passivation (reducing $\Phi_{\mathrm{GB}}$ from 0.15 eV to 0.05 eV) and moderate grain growth (increasing $\ell$ from 5 nm to 25 nm) can raise the power factor by $\sim 6\times$ (from $\sim 4$ to $\sim 26$ mW\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-2}$) and the electronic quality factor $B$ by nearly $7\times$ (from $\sim 0.15$ to $&gt;1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^2$\,V$^{-1}$\,s$^{-1}$\,kg$^{3/2}$), approaching values achieved in leading chalcogenide thermoelectrics. The model therefore provides a transparent and practical framework for grain-boundary engineering in oxide-based thermoelectrics.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry protected topology has been studied extensively in the past twenty years, but the topology protected by spin symmetry has just begun to be studied. In this work, based on spin symmetry analysis, we propose that a class of Weyl nodal line semimetals is protected by the spin symmetry. Then, by the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ are node-network semimetals protected by the spin symmetry. Moreover, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ have nodal rings protected by the mirror symmetry and Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic spin symmetry. Furthermore, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ transform node-network semimetal phase into Weyl semimetal phase when considering spin-orbit coupling. Therefore, our work not only enriches the topological phases protected by spin symmetry, but also provides an excellent material platform to investigate the exotic physical properties of multiple altermagnetic topological semimetal phases in experiment.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mapping of Microstructure Transitions during Rapid Alloy Solidification Using Bayesian-Guided Phase-Field Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.</description>

We observe n-type behavior in all samples, with carrier concentration ranging from $4 \times 10^{18}$ to $4 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ at room temperature (RT). We observe a champion RT Hall mobility of 11.1 $\mathrm{cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}}$, which is competitive with established thin-film photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Temperature-dependent Hall mobility data show that phonon scattering dominates at room temperature, in agreement with computational predictions. X-ray diffraction data illustrate a correlation between mobility and stacking fault concentration, illustrating how microstructure can affect transport. Despite the well-established environmental stability of chalcogenide perovskites, we observe significant changes to electronic properties as a function of storage time in ambient conditions. With the help of secondary-ion mass-spectrometry (SIMS) measurements, we propose and support a defect mechanism that explains this behavior: as-grown films have a high concentration of sulfur vacancies that are shallow donors ($\mathrm{V_S^\bullet}$ or $\mathrm{V_S^{\bullet \bullet}}$), which are converted into neutral oxygen defects ($\mathrm{O_S^\times}$) upon air exposure. We discuss the relevance of this defect mechanism within the larger context of chalcogenide perovskite research, and we identify means to stabilize the electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Sliding Ferroelectrics Induced Hybrid-Order Topological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose ferroelectric layer sliding as a new approach to realize and manipulate topological quantum states in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer magnetic van der Waals materials. We show that stacking monolayer ferromagnetic topological states into layer-spin-locked bilayer antiferromagnetic structures, and introducing sliding ferroelectricity leads to asynchronous topological evolution of different layers (spins) owing to existence of polarization potentials, thereby giving rise to rich layer-resolved topological phases. As a specific example, by means of a lattice model, we show that a bilayer magnetic 2D second order topological insulator (SOTI) reveals an unrecognized spin-hybrid-order topological insulator after undergoing ferroelectric sliding. Interestingly, in such phase, the spin-up (top layer) and spin-down (bottom layer) channels exhibit first-order and second-order topological properties, respectively. Moreover, other topological phases such as SOTI, quantum spin Hall insulator, quantum anomalous Hall insulator, and trivial insulator can also emerge through changes in the parameters of the system, and the relevant topological indices are also discussed. In terms of materials, based on first principles calculations, we predict material ScI2 can serve as an ideal platform to realize our proposal. Further, we predict that the anomalous Nernst effect of these several topological phases exhibits distinct differences, and therefore can be used as a signal for experimentally probing.</description>

      <title>Fully characterized linear magnetoelectric response of 2D monolayers from high-throughput first-principles calculations</title>

Abstract: We screen 4784 stable monolayers from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) and identify 57 ferromagnetic (FM) and 67 antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds that should exhibit linear magnetoelectric (ME) effects. Using density functional theory, we compute contributions from the spin and orbital angular momentum as well as lattice-mediated and clamped-ion analogs to fully characterize the linear ME tensor in the static limit. We observe a general trend that AFM ordering gives rise to a larger ME response compared to FM ordered monolayers. Using a typical van der Waals interlayer distance, we find that AFM $\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{SI}_2$ exhibits the strongest component of linear ME response, providing approximately 580 ps/m. This is two orders of magnitude greater than in prototypical $\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ but comparable to the largest ME response measured in bulk $\mathrm{TbPO}_4$ (280-740 ps/m). We also search for antimagnetoelectricity and find a number of FM and AFM compounds with antiferroic tensor entries. By demonstration of select examples and analysis of our full data set, we argue that inclusion of all contributions (spin, orbital, lattice-mediated and clamped-ion) is of crucial importance for reliable predictions of the total ME response.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Strain-Induced Landau Levels in a Graphene - Black Phosphorus Heterostructure</title>

Abstract: Strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields offer the possibility of realizing zero magnetic field Quantum Hall effect in graphene, possibly up to room temperature, representing a promising avenue for lossless charge transport applications. Strain engineering on graphene has been achieved via random nanobubbles or artificial nanostructures on the substrate, but the highly localized and non-uniform pseudomagnetic fields can make spectroscopic probes of electronic structure difficult. Heterostructure engineering offers an alternative approach: By stacking graphene on top of another van der Waals material with large lattice mismatch at a desired twist angle, it is possible to generate large strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields uniformly over the entire heterostructure. Here, we report using nano-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) to probe the electronic bandstructure of a graphene/black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP). By directly measuring the iso-energy contours of graphene and black phosphorus we determine a twist angle of 20-degrees in our heterostructure. High-resolution nano-ARPES of the graphene bands near the Fermi level reveals the emergence of flat bands located within the Dirac cone. The spacing of the flat bands is consistent with Landau level formation in graphene, and corresponds to a pseudo-field of 11.36 T. Our work provides a new way to study quantum Hall phases induced by strain in 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting (metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered insulators, exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic, insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave functions may fulfill ``holographic'' area laws, since their correlation fractal dimension is \(d_2\approx 2\).</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence-Based Gas Sensing with MoS2 Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <title>Twist Angle Dependent Ultrafast Transient Dynamics of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals Heterostructures beyond the Exciton Mott Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ($\theta$) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moir\'e potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying $\theta$. Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Electron Fourier ptychography for phase reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed to high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm using data collected in an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible alternative approach to structural studies.</description>
