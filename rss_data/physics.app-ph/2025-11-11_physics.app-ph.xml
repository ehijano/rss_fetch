      <title>From cathode to anode: Understanding lithium loss in 21700-type Ni-rich NCM||Graphite-SiOx cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving to larger cell formats in lithium-ion batteries increases overall useable energy but introduces inhomogeneities that influence aging. This study investigates degradation in 21700-type cells with NCM cathodes and graphite/SiOx anodes under cyclic aging, using in operando neutron diffraction, neutron depth profiling, and X-ray computed tomography. Prolonged cycling causes lithium loss, observed on the cathode side as reduced NCM unit cell change during cycling. On the anode side, this loss appears as diminished formation of the fully lithiated LiC6 phase. Differential voltage analysis during aging reveals not only lithium inventory loss but also active anode material loss. Diffraction data confirm this through shifts in the LiC12 transition and LiC6 onset to lower capacities, requiring less lithium to trigger the transitions. Lithium concentration profiles across electrode positions show depletion in the cathode, while elevated concentrations in the anode indicate increased solid-electrolyte interphase formation, suggesting lithium consumed from the cathode deposits on the anode side. CT measurements show that intrinsic inhomogeneities inside the cells have a stronger influence on the macroscopic structure than aging-induced changes, indicating that the observed capacity fade primarily originates from microscopic degradation processes within the electrodes. Overall, the combined techniques provide direct evidence of lithium loss, active material degradation, and spatially dependent aging mechanisms in large-format cylindrical cells.</description>

      <title>Local metamaterials and transition layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we elucidate the concept of local acoustic metamaterials. These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Inversion of the impedance response towards physical parameter extraction using interpretable machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting the impedance response of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is challenging due to the complex coupling of ionic and electronic motion. While drift-diffusion (DD) modelling is a reliable method, its mathematical complexity makes directly extracting physical parameters from experimental data infeasible. This work uses DD modelling to generate a large synthetic dataset of impedance spectra for a standard TiO2/MAPI/spiro configuration. This dataset trains machine learning (ML) models to predict recombination and ionic parameters from impedance measurements. A Gradient Boosting Regressor, using features from a generalized equivalent circuit, showed the best performance. Interpretative analysis indicates open-circuit impedance experiments best probe recombination losses, while short-circuit conditions are more adequate for extracting ionic features like concentrations and mobilities. The trained ML models were tested on experimental spectra, confirming the inferred physical parameters could reproduce the data. For the studied configuration, predicted ion concentrations were (1.3-3.3) 10^17 cm-3, ion mobilities were (5-7) 10^-11 cm2V-1s-1, and surface recombination velocities were 7-9 and 23-35 m/s. This approach provides insights into the physical information extractable from impedance measurements and paves the way for ML models to unambiguously derive efficiency-determining parameters for solar cells.</description>

      <title>Effect of shape on void growth: A coupled Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) and Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (DDP) study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voids are one of the many material defects present at the microscopic length scale. They are primarily responsible for the formation of cracks and hence contribute to ductile fracture. Circular voids tend to deform into elliptical voids just before their coalescence to form cracks. The principle aim of this study is to investigate the effect of void shape on the micro-mechanism of void growth by using Discrete Dislocation Plasticity simulations. For voided crystals, conventional DDP produces a continuous slip step throughout the material even if a dislocation escapes from a non-convex domain. To overcome this issue, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is used here to incorporate the displacement discontinuity. Different aspect ratios of elliptical voids are considered under uniaxial and biaxial deformation boundary conditions. The results suggest that voids having the largest surface area tend to have maximum growth rate as compared to void with lower surface area, i.e. "larger is faster". Under biaxial loading, a higher magnitude of strain hardening, and void growth rate are observed as compared to uniaxial loading. The results also suggest that the orientation of slip planes as well as voids, affect the overall plastic behavior of the voided-ductile material. Furthermore, circular void tends to induce minimum growth rate but have the maximum strain hardening effect as compared to other void shapes under both loading conditions. The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of ductile fracture with applications in manufacturing industry, aerospace industry and in the design of nano/micro-electromechanical devices i.e. NEMS/MEMS.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-driven responses through multiscale 3D-printed knits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For their resilience and toughness, filamentous entanglements are ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems across length scales, from polymer-chain- to collagen-networks and from cable-net structures to forest canopies. Textiles are an everyday manifestation of filamentous entanglement: the remarkable resilience and toughness in knitted fabrics arise predominately from the topology of interlooped yarns. Yet most architected materials do not exploit entanglement as a design primitive, and industrial knitting fixes a narrow set of patterns for manufacturability. Additive manufacturing has recently enabled interlocking structures such as chainmail, knot and woven assemblies, hinting at broader possibilities for entangled architectures. The general challenge is to treat knitting itself as a three-dimensional architected material with predictable and tunable mechanics across scales. Here, we show that knitted architectures fabricated additively can be recast as periodic entangled solids whose responses are both fabric-like and programmable. We reproduce the characteristic behavior of conventional planar knits and extend knitting into the third dimension by interlooping along three orthogonal directions, yielding volumetric knits whose stiffness and dissipation are tuned by prescribed pre-strain. We propose a simple scaling that unifies the responses across stitch geometries and constituent materials. Further, we realize the same topology from centimeter to micrometer scales, culminating in the fabrication of what is, to our knowledge, the smallest knitted structure ever made. By demonstrating 3D-printed knits can be interpreted both as a traditional fabric, as well as a novel architected material with defined periodicity, this work establishes the dual nature of entangled filaments and paves the way towards a new form of material architectures with high degrees of entanglement.</description>

      <title>An uncertainty-aware physics-informed neural network solution for the Black-Scholes equation: a novel framework for option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an uncertainty-aware, physics-informed neural network (PINN) for option pricing that solves the Black--Scholes (BS) partial differential equation (PDE) as a mesh-free, global surrogate over $(S,t)$. The model embeds the BS operator and boundary/terminal conditions in a residual-based objective and requires no labeled prices. For American options, early exercise is handled via an obstacle-style relaxation while retaining the BS residual in the continuation region. To quantify \emph{epistemic} uncertainty, we introduce an anchored-ensemble fine-tuning stage (AT--PINN) that regularizes each model toward a sampled anchor and yields prediction bands alongside point estimates. On European calls/puts, the approach attains low errors (e.g., MAE $\sim 5\times10^{-2}$, RMSE $\sim 7\times10^{-2}$, explained variance $\approx 0.999$ in representative settings) and tracks ground truth closely across strikes and maturities. For American puts, the method remains accurate (MAE/RMSE on the order of $10^{-1}$ with EV $\approx 0.999$) and does not exhibit the error accumulation associated with time-marching schemes. Against data-driven baselines (ANN, RNN) and a Kolmogorov--Arnold FINN variant (KAN), our PINN matches or outperforms on accuracy while training more stably; anchored ensembles provide uncertainty bands that align with observed error scales. We discuss design choices (loss balancing, sampling near the payoff kink), limitations, and extensions to higher-dimensional BS settings and alternative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic wave enabled all-optical determination of the interlayer elastic constants of van der Waals interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of two-dimensional materials interfaces with the substrate is necessary for device applications. Surface acoustic wave propagation through the layered material flake on a substrate could provide unique information on the transverse rigidity of the flake-to-substrate interaction. We generate ultrasonic waves by a focused femtosecond laser pulse at the surface of the model system -- fused silica with h-BN flake transferred above. Using an all-optical spatially resolved pump-probe interferometric technique, we measure the spatial dependencies of the surface vertical velocity profiles. Our measurements reveal the appearance of the surface acoustic wave dispersion in the hBN flake region compared to fused silica surface. Multilayer modeling allows us to gain access to longitudinal and shear elastic coupling constants $c^*_{33}$ and $c^*_{44}$ between hexagonal BN and substrate.</description>

      <title>Ultranarrow Bright Single-Photon Emitters in Diamond with Strong Broadband Phonon Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters are fundamental building blocks for quantum information processing, communication and sensing. However, unwanted interactions with bulk phonons in their host environment strongly limit their coherence and controllability. We report single color centers in nanodiamonds that are strongly and comprehensively decoupled from the bulk phononic environment. The color centers feature record-narrow linewidths down to 0.3 nm at room temperature and stable, bright emission, exceeding 10 Mcps in saturation. Notably, the bulk phonon sideband is almost entirely suppressed, revealing the presence of a single localized vibrational mode outside the diamond phonon band. Our observations and simulations point towards a unique mechanism for phonon decoupling in common wide-gap materials, based on a strongly radiative orbital transition coupled to a localized vibrational mode. The new color center enables qualitatively higher performance for applications in quantum networks and nanoscale sensing, and the exploration of new physical resources associated with vibrational states.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Enhancement of Yield Strength due to Static Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction is fundamental to mechanical stability across scales, from geological faults and architectural structures to granular materials and animal feet. We study the mechanical stability of a minimal friction-stabilized structure composed of three cylindrical particles arranged in a triangular stack on a floor under gravity. We analyze the yield force, defined as the threshold compressive force applied quasi-statically from above at which the structure collapses due to sliding at the floor contact. Using singular perturbation analysis, we derive an expression which quantitatively predicts the yield force as a function of the static friction coefficient and a small dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ characterizing elastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Eigenmode-Guided Amplification via Spatiotemporal Active Acoustic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spatiotemporal gain-loss framework for eigenmode steering in coupled acoustic resonators. A cross-coupled gain-loss coefficient links the gain of one resonator to the intensity of its partner, creating nonlinear feedback that conserves total energy while driving the system toward the eigenmode associated with the eigenvalue having the largest imaginary part-a deterministic eigenmode collapse. Spatial gain-loss profiles shape the eigenvalue spectrum and attractor landscape, while temporal modulation governs the transition dynamics. When symmetry prevents direct access to a target eigenmode, controlled spatiotemporal perturbations enable otherwise symmetry-forbidden transitions and accelerate convergence. Within this framework, parity-time (PT) symmetry appears as a special case, allowing tunable switching between collapse and Rabi-like oscillations near the exceptional point. Full-wave simulations of coupled Helmholtz resonators confirm precise and programmable acoustic energy routing, establishing spatiotemporal gain-loss engineering as a route to reconfigurable wave control and analog information processing.</description>

      <title>Screening currents increase thermal quench propagation speed in ultra-high-field REBCO magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting REBCO ($RE$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, where $RE$ is a rare earth, typically Y, Gd or Eu) electromagnets are useful for many applications like medical magnetic resonace imaging (MRI), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and magnets for particle accelerators and detectors. REBCO magnets are also the core of many nuclear fusion energy start-ups. In order to avoid permanent damage during operation, magnet design needs to take electro-thermal quench into account, which is due to unavoidable REBCO tape or magnet imperfections. However, most high-field magnet designs do not take superconducting screening currents into account. In this work, we show that it is essential to consider screening currents in magnet design, since they highly speed-up electrothermal quench propagation. Our study is based on detailed numerical modeling, based on the Minimum Electromagnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) and Finite Differences (MEMEP-FD). Benchmarking with well-established Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) model supports the correctness of MEMEP-FD. This work focusses on a 32 T all-superconducting magnet design and we analyze in detail the time evolution of electrothermal quench. Our findings will have an impact in the design of ultra-high-field magnets for NMR or user facilities, and possibly for other kinds of magnets, like those for fusion energy.</description>

      <title>Raman Microspectroscopy for Real-Time Structure Indicator in Ultrafast Laser Writing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser fabrication enables the creation of a wide range of devices, but its scalability and yield can be limited by the lack of real-time, in-situ monitoring tools. In particular, there is a strong need for metrics that directly correlate with device performance. Raman microspectroscopy provides a non-destructive route for in-situ characterization. Here, we demonstrate its potential to assess the electrical performance of laser-written graphitic electrodes in diamond. By combining hyperspectral mapping with electrical testing, we show that depletion of the 1332 cm$^{-1}$ sp3 Raman line serves as a monotonic and robust predictor of resistance, offering clear advantages over commonly used spectral features. We further introduce hyperspectral unmixing as a label-free approach to identify relevant spectral signatures in fabrication processes where Raman markers are less defined. Importantly, the methodology we present is not restricted to diamond but can be adapted to other host materials and functionalities, offering a practical path toward specification-driven fs-laser microfabrication.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of thermal illusions through latent-space geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Illusion effects-where one object appears as another-arise from the non-uniqueness of physical systems, in which different material configurations yield identical external responses. Conventional approaches, such as coordinate transformation, map equivalent configurations but provide only specific solutions, while analytical or numerical optimization methods extend these designs by minimizing scattering yet remain constrained by model assumptions and computational cost. Here, we exploit this non-uniqueness through a data-driven framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compress high-dimensional thermal-field data into a compact latent space capturing geometrical relations between configurations and observations. In this latent space, thermal illusion corresponds to finding configurations that minimize geometric distance to a target configuration, with thermal cloaking as a special case where the target is free space. Specifically, we demonstrate the concept in a cylindrical shell with anisotropic thermal conductivities enclosing a core of arbitrary conductivity, achieving robust thermal illusion and cloaking using only positive conductivities. Such a latent-space distance approach provides a refreshed perspective for achieving illusion and can be applied to inverse-design problems in other classical wave systems.</description>

Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors are extensively studied for applications ranging from bioelectronics to analog and neuromorphic computing. Despite significant advances, the fundamental interactions between the polymer semiconductor channel and the electrolyte, which critically determine the device performance, remain underexplored. Here, we examine the coupling between the benchmark semiconductor PEDOT:PSS and an ionic liquid to explain the bistable and non-volatile behavior observed in OECTs. Using X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate how the electrolyte modifies the channel composition, enhances molecular order, and reshapes the energetic landscape. Notably, the observed bistability arises from asymmetric and path-dependent energetics during doping and dedoping, resulting in two distinct paths, driven by a direct interaction between the electronic and ionic charge carriers. These findings highlight the electrolyte's role in tuning charge carrier dynamics, positioning it as a powerful yet underutilized lever for enabling novel device functionalities.</description>
