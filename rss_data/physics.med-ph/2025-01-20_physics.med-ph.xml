      <title>ComptoNet: An End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Scatter Estimation in Multi-Source Stationary CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (MSS-CT) offers significant advantages in medical and industrial applications due to its gantry-less scan architecture and/or capability of simultaneous multi-source emission. However, the lack of anti-scatter grid deployment in MSS-CT results in severe forward and/or cross scatter contamination, presenting a critical challenge that necessitates an accurate and efficient scatter correction. In this work, ComptoNet, an innovative end-to-end deep learning framework for scatter estimation in MSS-CT, is proposed, which integrates Compton-scattering physics with deep learning techniques to address the challenges of scatter estimation effectively. Central to ComptoNet is the Compton-map, a novel concept that captures the distribution of scatter signals outside the scan field of view, primarily consisting of large-angle Compton scatter. In ComptoNet, a reference Compton-map and/or spare detector data are used to guide the physics-driven deep estimation of scatter from simultaneous emissions by multiple sources. Additionally, a frequency attention module is employed for enhancing the low-frequency smoothness. Such a multi-source deep scatter estimation framework decouples the cross and forward scatter. It reduces network complexity and ensures a consistent low-frequency signature with different photon numbers of simulations, as evidenced by mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) that are less than $1.26\%$. Conducted by using data generated from Monte Carlo simulations with various phantoms, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ComptoNet, with significant improvements in scatter estimation accuracy (a MAPE of $0.84\%$). After scatter correction, nearly artifact-free CT images are obtained, further validating the capability of our proposed ComptoNet in mitigating scatter-induced errors.</description>

      <title>Underestimation of systolic pressure in cuff-based blood pressure measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High blood pressure (hypertension) is the number one risk factor for premature death. Hypertension is asymptomatic, so blood pressure must be regularly monitored to diagnose it. In auscultatory blood pressure measurement, a patient's systolic (maximum) and diastolic (minimum) blood pressure are inferred from the pressure in an inflatable cuff wrapped around the arm. This technique is the gold standard against which all other non-invasive devices are validated. However, auscultatory measurements systematically underestimate systolic blood pressure and overestimate diastolic blood pressure. Overestimation is attributed to the increased cuff pressure needed to occlude the artery because of the surrounding tissue and arterial stiffness. In contrast, the cause of systolic underestimation, which leads to potentially a third of systolic hypertension cases being missed, has remained unclear. When the cuff is inflated beyond the systolic blood pressure, the blood flow to the vessels downstream of the cuff is cut off. The pressure in these downstream vessels drops to a low plateau. We have developed a novel experimental rig that shows that the low downstream pressure is the key cause of the underestimation of systolic blood pressure. The lower the downstream pressure, the greater the underestimation. Our results yield a simple physical model for the underestimation of systolic pressure in our rig and in the human body. Understanding the physics behind the underestimation of systolic blood pressure paves the way for developing strategies to mitigate this error.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the high compliance mechanism by which the urinary bladder fills under low pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high compliance of the urinary bladder during filling is essential for its proper function, enabling it to accommodate significant volumetric increases with minimal rise in transmural pressure. This study aimed to elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon by analyzing the ex vivo filling process in rat from a fully voided state to complete distension, without preconditioning, using three complementary imaging modalities. High-resolution micro-CT at 10.8 {\mu}m resolution was used to generate detailed 3D reconstructions of the bladder lumen, revealing a 62 fold increase in bladder volume during filling. Pressure-volume studies of whole bladder delineated three mechanical filling regimes: an initial high-compliance phase, a transitional phase, and a final high-pressure phase. While prior studies conjectured small mucosal rugae (450 {\mu}m) are responsible for the high compliance phase, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) of the dome of the voided bladder revealed large folds an order of magnitude larger than these rugae. Bladder imaging during the inflation process demonstrated flattening of these large scale folds is responsible for volume increases in the initial high compliance phase. The 3D reconstructions of the bladder lumen in the filled and voided state revealed a high voiding efficiency of 97.13%. The MPM imaging results suggest the large scale folds in the dome enable this high voiding fraction by driving urine toward the bladder outlet. These insights are vital for computational models of bladder biomechanics and understanding changes to bladder function due to pathological conditions such as bladder outlet obstruction and age-related dysfunction.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed DeepCT: Sinogram Wavelet Decomposition Meets Masked Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion model shows remarkable potential on sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction. However, when a network is trained on a limited sample space, its generalization capability may be constrained, which degrades performance on unfamiliar data. For image generation tasks, this can lead to issues such as blurry details and inconsistencies between regions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Sinogram-based Wavelet random decomposition And Random mask diffusion Model (SWARM) for SVCT reconstruction. Specifically, introducing a random mask strategy in the sinogram effectively expands the limited training sample space. This enables the model to learn a broader range of data distributions, enhancing its understanding and generalization of data uncertainty. In addition, applying a random training strategy to the high-frequency components of the sinogram wavelet enhances feature representation and improves the ability to capture details in different frequency bands, thereby improving performance and robustness. Two-stage iterative reconstruction method is adopted to ensure the global consistency of the reconstructed image while refining its details. Experimental results demonstrate that SWARM outperforms competing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative performance across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Realistic Total-Body J-PET Geometry Optimization -- Monte Carlo Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total-Body PET is one of the most promising medical diagnostics modalities. The high sensitivity provided by Total-Body technology can be advantageous for novel tomography methods like positronium imaging. Several efforts are ongoing to lower the price of the TB-PET systems. Among the alternatives, the Jagiellonian PET (J-PET) technology, based on plastic scintillator strips, offers a low-cost alternative. The work aimed to compare five Total-Body J-PET geometries as a possible next generation J-PET scanner design. We present comparative studies of performance characteristics of the cost-effective Total-Body PET scanners using J-PET technology. We investigated in silico five Total-Body scanner geometries. Monte Carlo simulations of the XCAT phantom, the 2-meter sensitivity line source and positronium sensitivity phantoms were performed. We compared the sensitivity profiles for 2-gamma and 3-gamma tomography, relative cost of the setups and performed quantitative analysis of the reconstructed images. The analysis of the reconstructed XCAT images reveals the superiority of the seven-ring scanners over the three-ring setups. However, the three-ring scanners would be approximately 2-3 times cheaper. The peak sensitivity values for two-gamma vary from 20 to 34 cps/kBq. The sensitivity curves for the positronium tomography have a similar shape to the two-gamma sensitivity profiles. The peak values are lower compared to the two-gamma cases, from about 20-28 times, with a maximum of 1.66 cps/kBq. The results show the feasibility of multi-organ imaging of all the systems to be considered for the next generation of TB J-PET designs. The relative cost for all the scanners is about 10-4 times lower compared to the cost of the uExplorer. These properties coupled together with J-PET cost-effectiveness, make the J-PET technology an attractive solution for broad application in clinics.</description>

      <title>The Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope: an instrument for characterization of Auger electron multiplicities and energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a new instrument, the Argonne Auger Radioisotope Microscope (ARM), capable of characterizing the Auger electron emission of radionuclides, including candidates relevant in nuclear medicine. Our approach relies on event-by-event ion-electron coincidence, time-of-flight, and spatial readout measurement to determine correlated electron multiplicity and energy distributions of Auger decays. We present a proof-of-principle measurement with the ARM using X-ray photoionization of stable krypton beyond the K-edge and identify a bifurcation in the electron multiplicity distribution depending on the emission of K-LX electrons. Extension of the ARM to the characterization of radioactive sources of Auger electron emissions is enabled by the combination of two recent developments: (1) cryogenic buffer gas beam technology to introduce Auger emitters into the detection region with well-defined initial conditions, and (2) large-area micro-channel plate detectors with multi-hit detection capabilities to simultaneously detect multiple electrons emitted in a single decay.
  The ARM will generate new experimental data on Auger multiplicities that can be used to benchmark atomic relaxation and decay models. This data will provide insight into the low-energy regime of Auger electrons where intensity calculations are most challenging and experimental data is limited. In particular, accurate multiplicity data of the low-energy regime can be used to inform oncological dosimetry models, where electron energies less than 500 eV are known to be most effective in damaging DNA and cell membranes.</description>
