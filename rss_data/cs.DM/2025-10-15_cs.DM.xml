      <title>Thin Trees via $k$-Respecting Cut Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin spanning trees lie at the intersection of graph theory, approximation algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. They are central to the long-standing \emph{thin tree conjecture}, which asks whether every $k$-edge-connected graph contains an $O(1/k)$-thin tree, and they underpin algorithmic breakthroughs such as the $O(\log n/\log\log n)$-approximation for ATSP. Yet even the basic algorithmic task of \emph{verifying} that a given tree is thin has remained elusive: checking thinness requires reasoning about exponentially many cuts, and no efficient certificates have been known.
  We introduce a new machinery of \emph{$k$-respecting cut identities}, which express the weight of every cut that crosses a spanning tree in at most $k$ edges as a simple function of pairwise ($2$-respecting) cuts. This yields a tree-local oracle that, after $O(n^2)$ preprocessing, evaluates such cuts in $O_k(1)$ time. Building on this oracle, we give the first procedure to compute the exact $k$-thinness certificate $\Theta_k(T)$ of any spanning tree for fixed $k$ in time $\tilde O(n^2+n^k)$, outputting both the certificate value and a witnessing cut.
  Beyond general graphs, our framework yields sharper guarantees in structured settings. In planar graphs, duality with cycles and dual girth imply that every spanning tree admits a verifiable certificate $\Theta_k(T)\le k/\lambda$ (hence $O(1/\lambda)$ for constant $k$). In graphs embedded on a surface of genus $\gamma$, refined counting gives certified (per-cut) bounds $O((\log n+\gamma)/\lambda)$ via the same ensemble coverage.</description>

      <title>Unimodular toric ideals of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a necessary and sufficient graph-theoretic characterization of toric ideals of graphs that are unimodular. As a direct consequence, we provide the structure of unimodular graphs by proving that the incidence matrix of a graph $G$ is unimodular if and only if any two odd cycles of $G$ intersect.</description>

      <title>Menger's Theorem for Temporal Paths (Not Walks)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A (directed) temporal graph is a (directed) graph whose edges are available only at specific times during its (discretized) lifetime $\tau$. In this setting, we ask that walks respect the temporal aspect by defining $\textit{temporal walks}$ as sequences of adjacent edges whose appearing times are either strictly increasing or non-decreasing (here called non-strict), depending on the scenario. The notion of disjointness between walks is also not unique: two walks are $\textit{vertex-disjoint}$ if they do not share a vertex, and are $\textit{temporal vertex-disjoint}$ if they do not share a vertex at the same time. Thus a $\textit{temporal path}$ is a temporal walk where no repetition of vertices, at any time, is allowed. This is an important distinction that separates the interpretation of our results from those of previous works on the topic. In this paper we focus on various questions regarding connectivity (maximum number of disjoint paths) and robustness (minimum size of a cut) between a given pair of vertices. Such problems are related to the well-known Menger's Theorem on static graphs. We explore all possible interpretations of such problems, according to vertex and temporal vertex-disjointness, strict and non-strict temporal paths, and directed and undirected temporal graphs. We present a number of new results, the main of which states that Menger's Theorem holds when the maximum number of temporal vertex-disjoint temporal paths is equal to 1.</description>

      <title>A Customized SAT-based Solver for Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ZykovColor, a novel SAT-based algorithm to solve the graph coloring problem working on top of an encoding that mimics the Zykov tree. Our method is based on an approach of H\'ebrard and Katsirelos (2020) that employs a propagator to enforce transitivity constraints, incorporate lower bounds for search tree pruning, and enable inferred propagations.
  We leverage the recently introduced IPASIR-UP interface for CaDiCaL to implement these techniques with a SAT solver. Furthermore, we propose new features that take advantage of the underlying SAT solver. These include modifying the integrated decision strategy with vertex domination hints and using incremental bottom-up search that allows to reuse learned clauses from previous calls. Additionally, we integrate a more effective clique computation and an algorithm for computing the fractional chromatic number to improve the lower bounds used for pruning during the search.
  We validate the effectiveness of each new feature through an experimental analysis. ZykovColor outperforms other state-of-the-art graph coloring implementations on the DIMACS benchmark set. Further experiments on random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our new approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art SAT-based methods for both very sparse and highly dense graphs. We give an additional configuration of ZykovColor that dominates other SAT-based methods on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs.</description>

      <title>First Order Logic and Twin-Width in Tournaments and Dense Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07683v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the classes of tournaments with tractable first-order model checking. For every hereditary class of tournaments $\mathcal T$, first-order model checking is either fixed parameter tractable or $\textrm{AW}[*]$-hard. This dichotomy coincides with the fact that $\mathcal T$ has either bounded or unbounded twin-width, and that the growth of $\mathcal T$ is either at most exponential or at least factorial. From the model-theoretic point of view, we show that NIP classes of tournaments coincide with bounded twin-width. Twin-width is also characterised by three infinite families of obstructions: $\mathcal T$ has bounded twin-width if and only if it excludes at least one tournament from each family. This generalises results of Bonnet et al.\ on ordered graphs.
  The key for these results is a polynomial time algorithm that takes as input a tournament $T$ and computes a linear order $&lt;$ on $V(T)$ such that the twin-width of the birelation $(T,&lt;)$ is at most some function of the twin-width of $T$. Since approximating twin-width can be done in polynomial time for an ordered structure $(T,&lt;)$, this provides a polynomial time approximation of twin-width for tournaments.
  Our results extend to oriented graphs with stable sets of bounded size, which may also be augmented by arbitrary binary relations.</description>

      <title>An NP-hardness result for the colored constrained maximum 2-edge-colorable subgraph problem in bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the maximum $k$-edge-colorable subgraph problem. In this problem we are given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the goal is to take $k$ matchings of $G$ such that their union contains maximum number of edges. This problem is NP-hard in cubic graphs, and polynomial-time solvable in bipartite graphs as we observe in our paper. We present an NP-hardness result for a version of this problem where we have color constraints on vertices. In fact, we show that this version is NP-hard already in bipartite graphs of maximum degree three. In order to achieve the result, we establish a connection between our problem and the problem of construction of special maximum matchings considered in the Master thesis of the author and defended back in 2003.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Fair Orientations of Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding fair orientations of graphs of chores, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, each edge corresponds to a chore, and a chore has zero marginal utility to an agent if its corresponding edge is not incident to the vertex corresponding to the agent. Recently, Zhou et al. (IJCAI, 2024) analyzed the complexity of deciding whether graphs containing a mixture of goods and chores have EFX orientations, and conjectured that deciding whether graphs containing only chores have EFX orientations is NP-complete. We resolve this conjecture by giving polynomial-time algorithms that find EF1 and EFX orientations of graphs containing only chores if they exist, even if there are self-loops. Remarkably, our result demonstrates a surprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because deciding whether graphs containing only goods have EFX orientations was shown to be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al. (EC, 2023). In addition, we show the EF1 and EFX orientation problems for multigraphs to be NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Balanced Fibonacci word rectangles, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational. Finally, we also examine the analogous question for the Tribonacci word.</description>
