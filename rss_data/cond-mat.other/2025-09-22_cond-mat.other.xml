      <title>Bulk-edge coulping induced by a moving impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More physics at the boundaries of a topological lattice remains to be explored for future applications of topological edge states. This work investigates the stability of topological edge states in the presence of a moving impurity. By modeling the impurity as a moving Gaussian on-site potential at the boundary of a two-dimensional (2D) lattice, we show that a moving impurity may cause significant modifications to edge transport, a feature markedly different from the expected robustness of edge transport against a static impurity. We further identify an interesting mechanism to explain the bulk-edge coupling using a co-moving frame, where the density of the bulk states and the degeneracy between the edge states and the bulk become key elements. The physical insights developed in this work are validated across multiple systems, including Chern insulators, quantum spin Hall insulators, and Floquet Chern insulators. Results presented in this work are complementary to our current understanding of the robustness of topological edge transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum printing -- the imprinting of quantum states from photons and phonons onto quantum matter. The discussion is focusing on charged fluids (metals, superconductors, Hall fluids) and neutral systems (magnets, excitons). We demonstrate how structured light can generate topological excitations, including vortices in superconductors and skyrmions in magnets. We also discuss how quantum printing induces magnetization in quantum paraelectrics and strain-mediated magnetization in Dirac materials. Finally, we propose future applications, such as printing entangled photon states, creating entangled topological excitations, and discuss applications of quantum printing to light induced quantum turbulence in a charged fluid. This review represents the expanded version of the shorter review submitted to Nature Physics.</description>

      <title>Gyromagnetic ratio and Pauli form factor in anisotropic QED$_{2 + 1}$ at one-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gyromagnetic ratio and Pauli form factor are important quantities that characterize the electric and magnetic moment distribution of a particle. The experimentally measured value for the gyromagnetic ratio or the spin g-factor of an electron in a vacuum agrees remarkably well with theoretical predictions, making it one of the biggest successes of quantum field theory. However, these factors may get modified compared to their vacuum counterparts due to the interaction present in the system. Motivating from that, in this article, we investigate the effects of interactions within the framework of $2+1$ dimensional Proca quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate how the g-factor and Pauli form factors change with the electron's Fermi velocity and the mass of the vector fields within Proca quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement manifestation of knot topology in a non-Hermitian lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the homotopy-knot theory has been utilized to implement effective topological classification for non-Hermitian systems, the physical implications underlying distinct knot topologies remain ambiguous and are rarely addressed. In this work, we propose a one-dimensional non-Hermitian four-band lattice model and map out its phase diagram according to the distinct knot structures residing in the moment space. The topological phase diagram is ascertained through a spectral winding number. Furthermore, we derive the exact analytic formula for the phase boundaries that delineate different knot topologies. To explore the concrete physical implications of distinct knot topologies, we investigate the many-body ground state entanglement entropy for free fermions loaded on such non-Hermitian lattice in real space. It turns out that different knot topologies imply different magnitudes of entanglement. Moreover, we show that the central charge c extracted from systematic finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy provides effective description of the phase diagram of the knot topology. Finally, we further confirm the phase boundaries for the topological phase transitions alternatively by numerical calculations of the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility. Our results showcase the connection between knot topology and entanglement of non-Hermitian systems and may facilitate further exploration of the profound and practical physical implications of knot topology.</description>

      <title>Entropy dynamics for a harmonic propeller-shaped planar molecular quantum Brownian rotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic stability is vital for the operation and control of molecular nanodevices, particularly molecular cogwheels in an external harmonic field. We used the relative change in rotator entropy as a measure of dynamical stability. This rotator dynamic is described by the Caldeira-Leggett quantum master equation: the main challenge is the absence of a general solution for this equation. As an alternative, we look for the initial states (pure or mixed) of the rotator that result in low entropy change. In order to create candidate initial states, we use an ansatz that align with the maximum entropy principle. We then find conditions for state preparation and system/bath parameters to achieve a small relative change in both linear and differential entropy in underdamped and non-underdamped regimes. We identify cases with relatively small entropy change and discuss their practical feasibility.</description>

      <title>Direct ab initio calculation of magnons in altermagnets: method, spin-space symmetry aspects, and application to MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate state-transfer in modular quantum computer architectures exploiting the ultrastrong coupling regime of interaction between quantum processing units and ICs. We show that protocols based on adiabatic coherent transport may achieve near-ideal single-letter quantum capacity and robustness against parametric fluctuations suppressing leakage induced by the dynamical Casimir effect.</description>
