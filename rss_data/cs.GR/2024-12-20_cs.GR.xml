      <title>GraphicsDreamer: Image to 3D Generation with Physical Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the surge of efficient and automated 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) methods has increasingly illuminated the path of transforming human imagination into complex 3D structures. However, the automated generation of 3D content is still significantly lags in industrial application. This gap exists because 3D modeling demands high-quality assets with sharp geometry, exquisite topology, and physically based rendering (PBR), among other criteria. To narrow the disparity between generated results and artists' expectations, we introduce GraphicsDreamer, a method for creating highly usable 3D meshes from single images. To better capture the geometry and material details, we integrate the PBR lighting equation into our cross-domain diffusion model, concurrently predicting multi-view color, normal, depth images, and PBR materials. In the geometry fusion stage, we continue to enforce the PBR constraints, ensuring that the generated 3D objects possess reliable texture details, supporting realistic relighting. Furthermore, our method incorporates topology optimization and fast UV unwrapping capabilities, allowing the 3D products to be seamlessly imported into graphics engines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can produce high quality 3D assets in a reasonable time cost compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>PixelMan: Consistent Object Editing with Diffusion Models via Pixel Manipulation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research explores the potential of Diffusion Models (DMs) for consistent object editing, which aims to modify object position, size, and composition, etc., while preserving the consistency of objects and background without changing their texture and attributes. Current inference-time methods often rely on DDIM inversion, which inherently compromises efficiency and the achievable consistency of edited images. Recent methods also utilize energy guidance which iteratively updates the predicted noise and can drive the latents away from the original image, resulting in distortions. In this paper, we propose PixelMan, an inversion-free and training-free method for achieving consistent object editing via Pixel Manipulation and generation, where we directly create a duplicate copy of the source object at target location in the pixel space, and introduce an efficient sampling approach to iteratively harmonize the manipulated object into the target location and inpaint its original location, while ensuring image consistency by anchoring the edited image to be generated to the pixel-manipulated image as well as by introducing various consistency-preserving optimization techniques during inference. Experimental evaluations based on benchmark datasets as well as extensive visual comparisons show that in as few as 16 inference steps, PixelMan outperforms a range of state-of-the-art training-based and training-free methods (usually requiring 50 steps) on multiple consistent object editing tasks.</description>

      <title>SEREP: Semantic Facial Expression Representation for Robust In-the-Wild Capture and Retargeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular facial performance capture in-the-wild is challenging due to varied capture conditions, face shapes, and expressions. Most current methods rely on linear 3D Morphable Models, which represent facial expressions independently of identity at the vertex displacement level. We propose SEREP (Semantic Expression Representation), a model that disentangles expression from identity at the semantic level. It first learns an expression representation from unpaired 3D facial expressions using a cycle consistency loss. Then we train a model to predict expression from monocular images using a novel semi-supervised scheme that relies on domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce MultiREX, a benchmark addressing the lack of evaluation resources for the expression capture task. Our experiments show that SEREP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, capturing challenging expressions and transferring them to novel identities.</description>

      <title>GenHMR: Generative Human Mesh Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial in many computer vision applications; from health to arts and entertainment. HMR from monocular images has predominantly been addressed by deterministic methods that output a single prediction for a given 2D image. However, HMR from a single image is an ill-posed problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods have attempted to address this by generating and fusing multiple plausible 3D reconstructions, but their performance has often lagged behind deterministic approaches. In this paper, we introduce GenHMR, a novel generative framework that reformulates monocular HMR as an image-conditioned generative task, explicitly modeling and mitigating uncertainties in the 2D-to-3D mapping process. GenHMR comprises two key components: (1) a pose tokenizer to convert 3D human poses into a sequence of discrete tokens in a latent space, and (2) an image-conditional masked transformer to learn the probabilistic distributions of the pose tokens, conditioned on the input image prompt along with randomly masked token sequence. During inference, the model samples from the learned conditional distribution to iteratively decode high-confidence pose tokens, thereby reducing 3D reconstruction uncertainties. To further refine the reconstruction, a 2D pose-guided refinement technique is proposed to directly fine-tune the decoded pose tokens in the latent space, which forces the projected 3D body mesh to align with the 2D pose clues. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GenHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Multimodal Latent Diffusion Model for Complex Sewing Pattern Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating sewing patterns in garment design is receiving increasing attention due to its CG-friendly and flexible-editing nature. Previous sewing pattern generation methods have been able to produce exquisite clothing, but struggle to design complex garments with detailed control. To address these issues, we propose SewingLDM, a multi-modal generative model that generates sewing patterns controlled by text prompts, body shapes, and garment sketches. Initially, we extend the original vector of sewing patterns into a more comprehensive representation to cover more intricate details and then compress them into a compact latent space. To learn the sewing pattern distribution in the latent space, we design a two-step training strategy to inject the multi-modal conditions, \ie, body shapes, text prompts, and garment sketches, into a diffusion model, ensuring the generated garments are body-suited and detail-controlled. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method, significantly surpassing previous approaches in terms of complex garment design and various body adaptability.

      <title>LiftRefine: Progressively Refined View Synthesis from 3D Lifting with Volume-Triplane Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new view synthesis method via synthesizing a 3D neural field from both single or few-view input images. To address the ill-posed nature of the image-to-3D generation problem, we devise a two-stage method that involves a reconstruction model and a diffusion model for view synthesis. Our reconstruction model first lifts one or more input images to the 3D space from a volume as the coarse-scale 3D representation followed by a tri-plane as the fine-scale 3D representation. To mitigate the ambiguity in occluded regions, our diffusion model then hallucinates missing details in the rendered images from tri-planes. We then introduce a new progressive refinement technique that iteratively applies the reconstruction and diffusion model to gradually synthesize novel views, boosting the overall quality of the 3D representations and their rendering. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on the synthetic SRN-Car dataset, the in-the-wild CO3D dataset, and large-scale Objaverse dataset while achieving both sampling efficacy and multi-view consistency.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Problem Solving in Mixed Reality: A Study on Visual Graph Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Problem solving is a composite cognitive process, invoking a number of systems and subsystems, such as perception and memory. Individuals may form collectives to solve a given problem together, in collaboration, especially when complexity is thought to be high. To determine if and when collaborative problem solving is desired, we must quantify collaboration first. For this, we investigate the practical virtue of collaborative problem solving. Using visual graph analysis, we perform a study with 72 participants in two countries and three languages. We compare ad hoc pairs to individuals and nominal pairs, solving two different tasks on graphs in visuospatial mixed reality. The average collaborating pair does not outdo its nominal counterpart, but it does have a significant trade-off against the individual: an ad hoc pair uses 1.46 more time to achieve 4.6 higher accuracy. We also use the concept of task instance complexity to quantify differences in complexity. As task instance complexity increases, these differences largely scale, though with two notable exceptions. With this study we show the importance of using nominal groups as benchmark in collaborative virtual environments research. We conclude that a mixed reality environment does not automatically imply superior collaboration.</description>

      <title>IDOL: Instant Photorealistic 3D Human Creation from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating a high-fidelity, animatable 3D full-body avatar from a single image is a challenging task due to the diverse appearance and poses of humans and the limited availability of high-quality training data. To achieve fast and high-quality human reconstruction, this work rethinks the task from the perspectives of dataset, model, and representation. First, we introduce a large-scale HUman-centric GEnerated dataset, HuGe100K, consisting of 100K diverse, photorealistic sets of human images. Each set contains 24-view frames in specific human poses, generated using a pose-controllable image-to-multi-view model. Next, leveraging the diversity in views, poses, and appearances within HuGe100K, we develop a scalable feed-forward transformer model to predict a 3D human Gaussian representation in a uniform space from a given human image. This model is trained to disentangle human pose, body shape, clothing geometry, and texture. The estimated Gaussians can be animated without post-processing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and method. Our model demonstrates the ability to efficiently reconstruct photorealistic humans at 1K resolution from a single input image using a single GPU instantly. Additionally, it seamlessly supports various applications, as well as shape and texture editing tasks.</description>

      <title>DI-PCG: Diffusion-based Efficient Inverse Procedural Content Generation for High-quality 3D Asset Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is powerful in creating high-quality 3D contents, yet controlling it to produce desired shapes is difficult and often requires extensive parameter tuning. Inverse Procedural Content Generation aims to automatically find the best parameters under the input condition. However, existing sampling-based and neural network-based methods still suffer from numerous sample iterations or limited controllability. In this work, we present DI-PCG, a novel and efficient method for Inverse PCG from general image conditions. At its core is a lightweight diffusion transformer model, where PCG parameters are directly treated as the denoising target and the observed images as conditions to control parameter generation. DI-PCG is efficient and effective. With only 7.6M network parameters and 30 GPU hours to train, it demonstrates superior performance in recovering parameters accurately, and generalizing well to in-the-wild images. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results validate the effectiveness of DI-PCG in inverse PCG and image-to-3D generation tasks. DI-PCG offers a promising approach for efficient inverse PCG and represents a valuable exploration step towards a 3D generation path that models how to construct a 3D asset using parametric models.</description>

      <title>AniSora: Exploring the Frontiers of Animation Video Generation in the Sora Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animation has gained significant interest in the recent film and TV industry. Despite the success of advanced video generation models like Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX in generating natural videos, they lack the same effectiveness in handling animation videos. Evaluating animation video generation is also a great challenge due to its unique artist styles, violating the laws of physics and exaggerated motions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system, AniSora, designed for animation video generation, which includes a data processing pipeline, a controllable generation model, and an evaluation dataset. Supported by the data processing pipeline with over 10M high-quality data, the generation model incorporates a spatiotemporal mask module to facilitate key animation production functions such as image-to-video generation, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation. We also collect an evaluation benchmark of 948 various animation videos, the evaluation on VBench and human double-blind test demonstrates consistency in character and motion, achieving state-of-the-art results in animation video generation. Our evaluation benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/bilibili/Index-anisora.</description>

      <title>Training Datasets Generation for Machine Learning: Application to Vision Based Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Based Navigation consists in utilizing cameras as precision sensors for GNC after extracting information from images. To enable the adoption of machine learning for space applications, one of obstacles is the demonstration that available training datasets are adequate to validate the algorithms. The objective of the study is to generate datasets of images and metadata suitable for training machine learning algorithms. Two use cases were selected and a robust methodology was developed to validate the datasets including the ground truth. The first use case is in-orbit rendezvous with a man-made object: a mockup of satellite ENVISAT. The second use case is a Lunar landing scenario. Datasets were produced from archival datasets (Chang'e 3), from the laboratory at DLR TRON facility and at Airbus Robotic laboratory, from SurRender software high fidelity image simulator using Model Capture and from Generative Adversarial Networks. The use case definition included the selection of algorithms as benchmark: an AI-based pose estimation algorithm and a dense optical flow algorithm were selected. Eventually it is demonstrated that datasets produced with SurRender and selected laboratory facilities are adequate to train machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>SimAvatar: Simulation-Ready Avatars with Layered Hair and Clothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SimAvatar, a framework designed to generate simulation-ready clothed 3D human avatars from a text prompt. Current text-driven human avatar generation methods either model hair, clothing, and the human body using a unified geometry or produce hair and garments that are not easily adaptable for simulation within existing simulation pipelines. The primary challenge lies in representing the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging established prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural simulators. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework that combines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and garment meshes. Specifically, we first employ three text-conditioned 3D generative models to generate garment mesh, body shape and hair strands from the given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion models, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair strands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the avatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the garment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians through carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our synthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic, fully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current approaches.</description>
