      <title>A weaker notion of the finite factorization property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An (additive) commutative monoid is called atomic if every given non-invertible element can be written as a sum of atoms (i.e., irreducible elements), in which case, such a sum is called a factorization of the given element. The number of atoms (counting repetitions) in the corresponding sum is called the length of the factorization. Following Geroldinger and Zhong, we say that an atomic monoid $M$ is a length-finite factorization monoid if each $b \in M$ has only finitely many factorizations of any prescribed length. An additive submonoid of $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ is called a positive monoid. Factorizations in positive monoids have been actively studied in recent years. The main purpose of this paper is to give a better understanding of the non-unique factorization phenomenon in positive monoids through the lens of the length-finite factorization property. To do so, we identify a large class of positive monoids which satisfy the length-finite factorization property. Then we compare the length-finite factorization property to the bounded and the finite factorization properties, which are two properties that have been systematically investigated for more than thirty years.</description>

      <title>Formal lifting of dualizing complexes and consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a Noetherian ring $A$ that is $I$-adically complete for an ideal $I$, if $A/I$ admits a dualizing complex, so does $A$. This gives an alternative proof of the fact that a Noetherian complete local ring admits a dualizing complex. We discuss several consequences of this result. We also consider a generalization of the notion of dualizing complexes to infinite-dimensional rings and prove the results in this generality. In addition, we give an alternative proof of the fact that every excellent Henselian local ring admits a dualizing complex, using ultrapower.</description>

      <title>Revisiting derived crystalline cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.02921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the $\infty$-category of surjections of animated rings is projectively generated, introduce and study the notion of animated PD-pairs - surjections of animated rings with a "derived" PD-structure. This allows us to generalize classical results to non-flat and non-finitely-generated situations.
  Using animated PD-pairs, we develop several approaches to derived crystalline cohomology and establish comparison theorems. As an application, we generalize the comparison between derived and classical crystalline cohomology from syntomic (affine) schemes (due to Bhatt) to quasisyntomic schemes.
  We also develop a non-completed animated analogue of prisms and prismatic envelopes. We prove a variant of the Hodge-Tate comparison for animated prismatic envelopes from which we deduce a result about flat cover of the final object for quasisyntomic schemes, which generalizes several known results under smoothness and finiteness conditions.</description>

      <title>Linear equations with monomial constraints and decision problems in abelian-by-cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is undecidable whether a system of linear equations over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$ admit solutions where a specified subset of variables take value in the set of monomials $\{X^z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. In particular, we construct a finitely presented $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$-module, where it is undecidable whether a linear equation $X^{z_1} \boldsymbol{f}_1 + \cdots + X^{z_n} \boldsymbol{f}_n = \boldsymbol{f}_0$ has solutions $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This contrasts the decidability of the case $n = 1$, which can be deduced from Noskov's Lemma.
  We apply this result to settle a number of problems in computational group theory. We show that it is undecidable whether a system of equations has solutions in the wreath product $\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$, providing a negative answer to an open problem of Kharlampovich, L\'{o}pez and Miasnikov (2020). We show that there exists a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group in which the problem of solving a single quadratic equation is undecidable. We also construct a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group, different to that of Mishchenko and Treier (2017), in which the Knapsack Problem is undecidable. In contrast, we show that the problem of Coset Intersection is decidable in all finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic groups.</description>
