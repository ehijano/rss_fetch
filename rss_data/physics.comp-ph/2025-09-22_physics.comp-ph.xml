      <title>What does it mean for a system to compute?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world dynamic systems, both natural and artificial, are understood to be performing computations. For artificial dynamic systems, explicitly designed to perform computation - such as digital computers - by construction, we can identify which aspects of the dynamic system match the input and output of the computation that it performs, as well as the aspects of the dynamic system that match the intermediate logical variables of that computation. In contrast, in many naturally occurring dynamical systems that we understand to be computers, even though we neither designed nor constructed them - such as the human brain - it is not a priori clear how to identify the computation we presume to be encoded in the dynamic system. Regardless of their origin, dynamical systems capable of computation can, in principle, be mapped onto corresponding abstract computational machines that perform the same operations. In this paper, we begin by surveying a wide range of dynamic systems whose computational properties have been studied. We then introduce a very broadly applicable framework for identifying what computations(s) are emulated by a given dynamic system. After an introduction, we summarize key examples of dynamical systems whose computational properties have been studied. We then introduce a very broadly applicable framework that defines the computation performed by a given dynamical system in terms of maps between that system's evolution and the evolution of an abstract computational machine. We illustrate this framework with several examples from the literature, in particular discussing why some of those examples do not fully fall within the remit of our framework. We also briefly discuss several related issues, such as uncomputability in dynamical systems, and how to quantify the value of computation in naturally occurring computers.</description>

      <title>The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the hot-electron limit (HEL) closure of the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, denoted as gyromoment (GM). By expanding gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio Ti/Te limit and retaining only essential O(Ti/Te) terms, we obtain a closed system for density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In the Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy in Z-pinch geometry, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low-collisionality dynamics. Extension to tokamak-relevant s-alpha geometry, and comparison with gyrokinetic simulations, reveals the HEL closed GM model capabilities and limitations: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at Ti/Te=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents accurate Dimits shift prediction and transport suppression.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculation of higher-order elastic constants from divided differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is presented to calculate from first principles the higher-order elastic constants of a solid material. The method relies on finite strain deformations, a density functional theory approach to calculate the Cauchy stress tensor, and a recursive numerical differentiation technique homologous to the divided differences polynomial interpolation algorithm. The method is applicable as is to any material, regardless its symmetry, to calculate elastic constants of, in principle, any order. Here, we introduce conceptual framework and technical details of our method, we discuss sources of errors, we assess convergence trends, and we present selected applications. In particular, our method is used to calculate elastic constants up to the 6$^{th}$ order of two crystalline materials with the cubic symmetry, silicon and gold. To demonstrate general applicability, our method is also used to calculate the elastic constants up to the 5$^{th}$ order of $\alpha$-quartz, a crystalline material belonging to the trigonal crystal system, and the second- and third-order elastic constants of kevlar, a material with an anisotropic bonding network. Higher order elastic constants computed with our method are validated against density functional theory calculations by comparing stress responses to large deformations derived within the continuum approximation.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade Mediated by Two-Photon Absorption in an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.</description>

      <title>Ring polymers in two-dimensional melts double-fold around randomly branching "primitive shapes"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the concept of the "primitive path" of a linear chain in melt conditions, we introduce here a numerical protocol which allows us to detect, in an unambiguous manner, the "primitive shapes" of ring polymers in two-dimensional melts. Then, by analysing the conformational properties of these primitive shapes, we demonstrate that they conform to the statistics of two-dimensional branched polymers (or, trees) in the same melt conditions, in agreement with seminal theoretical work by Khokhlov, Nechaev and Rubinstein. Results for polymer dynamics in light of the branched nature of the rings are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised and probabilistic learning with Contrastive Local Learning Networks: The Restricted Kirchhoff Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous physical learning systems modify their internal parameters and solve computational tasks without relying on external computation. Compared to traditional computers, they enjoy distributed and energy-efficient learning due to their physical dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a self-learning resistor network, the Restricted Kirchhoff Machine, capable of solving unsupervised learning tasks akin to the Restricted Boltzmann Machine algorithm. The circuit relies on existing technology based on Contrastive Local Learning Networks, in which two identical networks compare different physical states to implement a contrastive local learning rule. We simulate the training of the machine on the binarized MNIST dataset, providing a proof of concept of its learning capabilities. Finally, we compare the scaling behavior of the time, power, and energy consumed per operation as more nodes are included in the machine to their Restricted Boltzmann Machine counterpart operated on CPU and GPU platforms.</description>

      <title>kh2d-solver: A Python Library for Idealized Two-Dimensional Incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python library for simulating two-dimensional incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in stratified shear flows. The solver employs a fractional-step projection method with spectral Poisson solution via Fast Sine Transform, achieving second-order spatial accuracy. Implementation leverages NumPy, SciPy, and Numba JIT compilation for efficient computation. Four canonical test cases explore Reynolds numbers 1000--5000 and Richardson numbers 0.1--0.3: classical shear layer, double shear configuration, rotating flow, and forced turbulence. Statistical analysis using Shannon entropy and complexity indices reveals that double shear layers achieve 2.8$\times$ higher mixing rates than forced turbulence despite lower Reynolds numbers. The solver runs efficiently on standard desktop hardware, with 384$\times$192 grid simulations completing in approximately 31 minutes. Results demonstrate that mixing efficiency depends on instability generation pathways rather than intensity measures alone, challenging Richardson number-based parameterizations and suggesting refinements for subgrid-scale representation in climate models.</description>

      <title>Near-field-free super-potential FFT method for the three-dimensional free-space Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectrally accurate, efficient FFT-based method for the three-dimensional free-space Poisson equation with smooth, compactly supported sources. The method adopts a super-potential formulation: we first compute the convolution with the biharmonic Green's function, then recover the potential by spectral differentiation, applying the Laplacian in Fourier space. A separable Gaussian-sum (GS) approximation enables efficient precomputation and quasi-linear, FFT-based convolution. Owing to the biharmonic kernel's improved regularity, the GS cutoff error is fourth-order, uniform for all target points, eliminating the near-field corrections and Taylor expansions required in standard GS/Ewald-type methods. Benchmarks on Gaussian, oscillatory, and compactly supported densities reach the double-precision limit and, at matched accuracy on the same hardware, reduce both error and per-solve runtime relative to our original GS-based scheme. The resulting method is simple, reproducible, and efficient for three-dimensional free-space Poisson problems with smooth sources on uniform grids.</description>

      <title>Gradient Alignment in Physics-informed Neural Networks: A Second-Order Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning through composite loss functions is fundamental to modern deep learning, yet optimizing competing objectives remains challenging. We present new theoretical and practical approaches for addressing directional conflicts between loss terms, demonstrating their effectiveness in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) where such conflicts are particularly challenging to resolve. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how these conflicts limit first-order methods and show that second-order optimization naturally resolves them through implicit gradient alignment. We prove that SOAP, a recently proposed quasi-Newton method, efficiently approximates the Hessian preconditioner, enabling breakthrough performance in PINNs: state-of-the-art results on 10 challenging PDE benchmarks, including the first successful application to turbulent flows with Reynolds numbers up to 10,000, with 2-10x accuracy improvements over existing methods. We also introduce a novel gradient alignment score that generalizes cosine similarity to multiple gradients, providing a practical tool for analyzing optimization dynamics. Our findings establish frameworks for understanding and resolving gradient conflicts, with broad implications for optimization beyond scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent time-series foundation models exhibit strong abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context, without knowledge of the underlying physics. Here, we show that foundation models often forecast through a simple parroting strategy, and when they are not parroting they exhibit some shared failure modes such as converging to the mean. As a result, a naive context parroting model that copies directly from the context scores higher than leading time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, including low-dimensional chaos, turbulence, coupled oscillators, and electrocardiograms -- and at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains recent works showing that large language models can often be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor, providing insight into previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. By revealing the performance gaps and failure modes of current time-series foundation models, context parroting can guide the design of future foundation models and help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</description>
