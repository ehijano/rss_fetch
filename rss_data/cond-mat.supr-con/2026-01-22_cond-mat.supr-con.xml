      <title>Vortex-parity-controlled diode effect in Corbino topological Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal supercurrents in Josephson junctions have recently emerged as a sensitive tool for investigating broken symmetries in superconducting quantum materials. Here, we report an even-odd Josephson diode effect (JDE) in Corbino-geometry junctions fabricated on the pristine surface of a bulk-insulating three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI). We find that the diode polarity, which indicates the preferred direction of supercurrent flow, robustly alternates its sign depending on the parity (even or odd) of the enclosed vortex number. This behavior is absent in two key control devices: a non-topological graphene Corbino Josephson junction and a 3DTI-based linear Josephson junction. These results indicate that the polarity-tunable JDE is intrinsically linked to the unique combination of the proximitized topological superconductivity in the 3DTI surface and the Corbino device's closed-loop geometry. Our theoretical modeling attributes the observed sign change in diode polarity to the alternating sign of periodic boundary conditions in topological superconductors, supporting the interpretation that the vortex-parity-controlled JDE is a direct manifestation of the underlying Andreev bound state topology associated with the presence of non-Abelian anyons in the vortices.</description>

      <title>Lumped-Element Model of THz HEB Mixer Based on Sputtered MgB2 Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis and experimental study of THz hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers made from 40-nm-thick sputtered magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin films on high-resistivity silicon substrates. Using a lumped-element bolometric model, we achieve strong quantitative agreement with measurements of conversion gain, noise temperature, and local-oscillator (LO) coupling to the HEB devices. Our analysis shows that the sensitivity of current HEB devices is primarily limited by on-chip optical losses, with both Johnson and thermal-fluctuation noise contributing significantly to the overall noise temperature. Simulations of an optimized device with near-ideal optical coupling suggest that Johnson noise remains a substantial factor even with improved coupling. Further reduction of the noise temperature may require additional suppression of Johnson noise (via improved intrinsic conversion gain) beyond optimizing optical coupling efficiency. We emphasize the importance of accurate modeling to achieve good numerical agreement with experiments, thereby enabling understanding of the causes of sensitivity loss.</description>

      <title>A Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Criterion for Metallic Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central unresolved question in the theory of superconductivity is why only a small subset of metallic elements exhibit a superconducting state, whereas many others remain strictly normal. Neither the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) framework nor its extensions involving charge density wave (CDW) or pair density wave (PDW) order provide a predictive or material-selective criterion capable of distinguishing superconducting metals from non-superconducting ones. In particular, the persistent absence of superconductivity in simple noble metals with well-defined Fermi surfaces poses a challenge for all traditional approaches. Here we address this problem using the Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Ginzburg Landau (GL) framework introduced in our previous work. In this formulation, a coarse-grained MEL charge field $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}(\mathbf{r})$ with momentum dependent stiffness $\alpha(q)$ is coupled to the superconducting (SC) order parameter $\psi(\mathbf{r})$. We show that metallic superconductivity emerges only when the system satisfies a specific ``MEL enhancement window,'' characterized by a negative minimum of $\alpha(q)$ at either a finite modulation wave vector $q^{\ast}$ or at $q=0$, together with sufficiently strong coupling between $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}$ and $\psi$. This unified criterion naturally partitions metallic elements into three universal classes: (i) MEL-enhanced superconductors with a finite-$q^{\ast}$ charge mode, (ii) conventional BCS superconductors as the homogeneous $q^{\ast}=0$ limit of the MEL framework, and (iii) metals for which $\alpha(q)$ remains positive for all $q$, suppressing all MEL modes and preventing any superconducting instability. By applying this criterion to simple metallic elements, we identify why some metals develop superconductivity while others do not, possibly resolving a selection problem long open within the BCS paradigm.</description>

      <title>Theory of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy for topological superconductors probed by $s$-wave superconducting tips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) with $s$-wave superconducting tips has been widely applied to probe exotic superconductors, but its potential for investigating topological superconductors remains unclear. In junctions between an $s$-wave superconductor and a topological superconductor, the dominant tunneling process is Andreev reflection, in which Cooper pairs from the $s$-wave superconductor tunnel as particle--hole excitations into the surface state of the topological superconductor. In this work, we theoretically investigate the fundamental properties of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy on topological superconductors, focusing on the $dI/dV$ characteristics and current noise. We develop a real-time description of an effective tunneling action incorporating Andreev reflection processes in the Keldysh formalism and derive analytical expressions for the Andreev reflection current and the associated current noise. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations for representative topological superconductors and provide a catalog of $dI/dV$ spectra and the Fano factor. Our results establish guidelines for probing topological superconductivity using STM with $s$-wave superconducting tips, and provide theoretical benchmarks for future STS experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Charge-Density-Wave Order and Suppressed Superconductivity in Intercalated Bulk $\mathrm{Nb}{\mathrm{Se}}_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic ground states of transition-metal dichalcogenides are strongly shaped by reduced dimensionality, yet the properties of atomically thin layers remain difficult to probe due to their small size and environmental sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that controlled electrochemical intercalation of organic cations provides a robust bulk platform for accessing monolayer-like physics in NbSe$_2$. Intercalation of tetrapropylammonium and tetrabutylammonium expands the interlayer spacing by nearly a factor of two, electronically decoupling the NbSe$_2$ layers while simultaneously introducing well-defined charge doping. Using a combination of Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoemission, we uncover a pronounced enhancement of the charge-density-wave transition temperature to $\sim 130$ K together with a strong suppression of superconductivity, reproducing the phase diagram observed in exfoliated monolayers. The enhanced charge-density-wave order and reduced $T_c$ arise from the combined effects of dimensionality reduction and electron injection, and are accompanied by distinct dip-hump anomalies in the tunneling spectra suggestive of collective mode excitations. Our results establish molecular intercalation as a powerful and scalable route for engineering competing orders in layered quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Spin Fluctuations in the Rare-Earth Doped Bilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin fluctuations have been generally believed as the pairing glue of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies have revealed a weak flat spin-fluctuation signal around 45 meV in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, suggesting strong interlayer and weak intralayer magnetic couplings ($SJ_{\perp}\approx$ 60 meV, $SJ_{\parallel}\leq$ 3.5 meV) in contrast to cuprate and pnictide superconductors. Here, we report further INS studies on the Pr and Nd doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ powder samples at ambient pressure. Besides the crystalline electric field excitations at low energies, we have found that the 45 meV flat mode splits into two modes in doped compounds, along with another weak mode at about 60 meV, where the spin fluctuations in La$_2$NdNi$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ are stronger than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Based on an effective Heisenberg model by only considering the nearest-neighbor exchange couplings on the stripe-type antiferromagnetic orders, we conclude that the interlayer coupling $SJ_{\perp}$ is enhanced to about 69 meV and 73 meV for Pr and Nd doped samples, respectively. Our results highlight the crucial role of interlayer coupling in the rare-earth doped bilayer nickelates, which towards to promote high $T_c$ via interlayer $s\pm$ pairing.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth and characterization of a hole-doped iron-based superconductor Ba(Fe$_{0.875}$Ti$_{0.125}$)$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the crystal growth of a new hole-doped iron-based superconductor Ba(Fe$_{0.875}$Ti$_{0.125}$)$_2$As$_2$ by substituting Ti on the Fe site. The crystals are accidentally obtained in trying to grow Ni doped Ba$_2$Ti$_2$Fe$_2$As$_4$O. After annealing at 500 \textcelsius $ $ in vacuum for one week, superconductivity is observed with zero resistance at $T_{c0} \approx 17.5$ K, and about 20\% diamagnetic volume down to 2 K. While both the small anisotropy of superconductivity and the temperature dependence of normal state resistivity are akin to the electron doped 122-type compounds, the Hall coefficient is positive and similar to the case in hole-doped Ba$_{0.9}$K$_{0.1}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. The density functional theory calculations suggest dominated hole pockets contributed by Fe/Ti 3$d$ orbitals. Therefore, the Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ti$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$ system provides a new platform to study the superconductivity with hole doping on the Fe site of iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Theory of reentrant superconductivity in Corbino Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions made of conventional superconductors display Fraunhofer-like oscillations of the critical current as a function of the threaded magnetic flux. When the superconductors are deposited on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, this pattern is slightly modified due to the presence of chiral Majorana modes. Here we calculate the critical current of a Corbino Josephson junction, where the fluxoid becomes quantized and the superconducting phase has an integer winding. We discover that circular junctions exhibit similar behavior in both topologically trivial and non-trivial scenarios, while non-circular junctions demonstrate a remarkable distinction. Using a simple analytical model, we show that these non-circular junctions exhibit reentrant superconductivity with a period related to their number of corners, and numerically we find that this period is halved in the topological case. The period halving may help establish the existence of topological superconductivity in hybrid topological insulator-superconductor junctions.</description>

      <title>Acoustic phonons in a magnetized vacuum? First-principle lattice results on the mass spectrum of the electroweak model in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use numerical Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector of the electroweak model in an external magnetic field of the electroweak-scale strength ($10^{20}\,{\rm T}$) at zero temperature. It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions.</description>

      <title>Cooperative stabilization of persistent currents in superfluid ring networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.</description>

      <title>Buried Dirac points in quantum spin Hall insulators: Implications for Majorana Kramers pair-based quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For heterostructures formed by a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) placed in proximity to a superconductor (SC), no external magnetic field is necessary to drive the system into a phase supporting topological superconductivity with Majorana zero energy states, making them very attractive for the realization of non-Abelian states and fault-tolerant qubits. Despite considerable work investigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their resilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for the formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC junction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a superconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance plateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is consistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk valence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the conductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the high transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show that a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D topological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana Kramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states, highlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.</description>

      <title>Majorana vortex phases in time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators and topologically trivial insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana vortex phases have been extensively studied in topological materials with conventional superconducting pairing. Inspired by recent experimental progress in realizing time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators (THOTIs) and inducing superconducting proximity effects, we investigate Majorana vortex phases in these systems. We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in W3Re2C with chiral structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover superconductivity in cubic W3Re2C with chiral structure and the superconducting transition temperature Tc is about 6.2 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore, the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both superconductivity and band topology.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on 1.3 GHz niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at 16 MV/m. We also observe an additive effect of O and N impurities in reducing R$_\mathrm{T}$. We discuss these results in the context of field dependent nonequilibrium superconductivity, gap enhancement, and hydrogen trapping mechanisms.</description>
