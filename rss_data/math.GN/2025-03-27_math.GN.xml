      <title>Weight, net weight, and elementary submodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we prove several theorems that are related to some results and problems from [6]. We answer two of the main problems that were raised in [6]. First we give a ZFC example of a Hausdorff space in $C(\omega_1)$ that has uncountable net weight. Then we prove that after adding any number of Cohen reals to a model of CH, in the extension every regular space in $C(\omega_1)$ has countable net weight. We prove in ZFC that for any regular topology of uncountable weight on $\omega_1$ there is a non-stationary subset that has uncountable weight as well. Moreover, if all final segments of $\omega_1$ have uncountable weight then the assumption of regularity can be dropped. By [6], the analogous statements for the net weight are independent from ZFC. Our proofs of all these results make essential use of elementary submodels.</description>

      <title>The small-scale limit of magnitude and the one-point property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnitude of a metric space is a real-valued function whose parameter controls the scale of the metric. A metric space is said to have the one-point property if its magnitude converges to 1 as the space is scaled down to a point. Not every finite metric space has the one-point property: to date, exactly one example has been found of a finite space for which the property fails. Understanding the failure of the one-point property is of interest in clarifying the interpretation of magnitude and its stability with respect to the Gromov--Hausdorff topology. We prove that the one-point property holds generically for finite metric spaces, but that when it fails, the failure can be arbitrarily bad: the small-scale limit of magnitude can take arbitrary real values greater than 1.</description>
