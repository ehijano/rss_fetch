      <title>Study of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein by Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spike protein (SP) of SARS-CoV-2 is the major molecular target for making diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutic development. We used a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface enhanced Raman microscopy (SERS) to study its structure. Using SERS on an aluminum substrate, we were able to detect a characteristic spectrum of SP mostly due to vibration of three aromatic amino acids producing Raman shifts at 466 cm-1, 524 cm-1, 773 cm-1, 831 cm-1, 1048 cm-1, 1308 cm-1, 1457 cm-1, and 1610 cm-1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of the SP showed periodic 2D-lattice orientation. The findings from this study have translational values for developing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based detectors for screening and testing SARS-CoV-2 signatures in diagnostic settings and contamination tracking.</description>

      <title>Bacterial dimensions sensitively regulate surface diffusivity and residence time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble is a common but vital strategy that bacteria employ to explore environment suffused with boundaries, as well as to escape from entrapment. In this study we reveal how this strategy and the resulting dynamical behavior can be sensitively regulated by bacterial dimensions. Our results demonstrate that the logarithm of the surface residence time for bacteria with constant tumble bias is linearly related to a dimensionless parameter of bacterial intrinsic size characteristics, where a small variation in bacterial dimensions, which is natural in a suspension, reproduces well the experimentally observed large variation in bacterial residence time. Furthermore, our results predict that the optimal tumble bias corresponding to the maximum surface diffusivity depends strongly on bacterial dimensions, where the same small variation in bacterial dimensions gives rise to a strongly diversified optimal tumble bias and an order of magnitude change in surface diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the navigation of magnetic microrobots through cerebral bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local administration of thrombolytics in ischemic stroke could accelerate clot lysis and the ensuing reperfusion while minimizing the side effects of systemic administration. Medical microrobots could be injected into the bloodstream and magnetically navigated to the clot for administering the drugs directly to the target. The magnetic manipulation required to navigate medical microrobots will depend on various parameters such as the microrobots size, the blood velocity, and the imposed magnetic field gradients. Numerical simulation was used to study the motion of magnetically controlled microrobots flowing through representative cerebral bifurcations, for predicting the magnetic gradients required to navigate the microrobots from the injection point until the target location. Upon thorough validation of the model against several independent analytical and experimental results, the model was used to generate maps and a predictive equation providing quantitative information on the required magnetic gradients, for different scenarios. The developed maps and predictive equation are crucial to inform the design, operation and optimization of magnetic navigation systems for healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Cell Deformation Signatures along the Apical-Basal Axis: A 3D Continuum Mechanics Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) mechanical models of confluent tissues have related the mechanical state of a monolayer of cells to the average perimeter length of the cell cross sections, predicting floppiness or rigidity of the material. For the well-studied system of in-vitro MDCK epithelial cells, however, we find experimentally that cells in mechanically rigid tissues display long perimeters characteristic of a floppy state in 2D models. We suggest that this discrepancy is due to mechanical effects in the third (apical-basal) dimension, including those caused by actin stress fibers near the basal membrane. To quantitatively understand cell deformations in 3D, we develop a continuum mechanics model of epithelial cells as elastic cylindrical shells, with appropriate boundary conditions reflecting both the passive confinement of neighboring cells and the active stress of actomyosin contractility. This formalism yields analytical solutions predicting cell cross sections along the entire cylinder axis. Deconvolution microscopy experimental data confirm the significant and systematic change in cell shape parameters in this apical-basal direction. In addition to providing a wealth of detailed information on deformation on the subcellular scale, the results of the approach alter our understanding of how active tissues balance requirements of their stiffness and integrity, suggesting they are more robust against loss of rigidity than previously inferred.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow generates bacterial conjugation hotspots by increasing the rate of shear-driven cell-cell encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conjugation accelerates bacterial evolution by enabling bacteria to acquire genes horizontally from their neighbors. Plasmid donors must physically encounter and connect with recipients to allow plasmid transfer, and different environments are characterized by vastly different encounter rates between cells, based on mechanisms ranging from simple diffusion to fluid flow. However, how the environment affects the conjugation rate by setting the encounter rate has been largely neglected, mostly because existing experimental setups do not allow direct control over cell encounters. Here, we describe the results of conjugation experiments in E. coli in which we systematically varied the magnitude of shear flow using a cone-and-plate rheometer to control the encounter rate. We discovered that the conjugation rate increases with shear until it peaks at an optimal shear rate (100 1/s), reaching a conjugation rate five-fold higher than the baseline set by diffusion-driven encounters. This optimum marks the transition from a regime in which shear promotes conjugation by increasing the rate of cell-cell encounters to a regime in which shear disrupts conjugation. Regions of high fluid shear are widespread in aquatic systems, in the gut of host organisms, and in soil, and our results indicate that these regions could be hotspots of bacterial conjugation in the environment.</description>
