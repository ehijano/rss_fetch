      <title>Stellar Loci. VIII. Photometric Metallicities for 100 Million Stars Based on Synthetic Gaia Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the stellar locus method to synthetic $(BP-RP)_{XPSP}$ and $(BP-G)_{XPSP}$ colors derived from corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra to obtain accurate and precise estimates of metallicity for about 100 million stars in the Milky Way (34 million giants in the color range $0.6 &lt; (BP-RP)_0 &lt; 1.75$ and 65 million dwarfs in the color range $0.2 &lt; (BP-RP)_0 &lt; 1.5$). The sub milli-magnitude precision of the derived synthetic stellar colors enables estimates of metallicity for stars as low as [Fe/H] $\sim -4$. Multiple validation tests indicate that the typical metallicity precision is between 0.05 -- 0.1 dex for both dwarfs and giants at [Fe/H] = 0 as faint as G $\sim$ 17, and decreases to 0.15 -- 0.25 dex at [Fe/H] = $-$2.0. For $-4.0 &lt;$ [Fe/H] $ &lt; -3.0$, the typical metallicity precision decreases to on the order of 0.4 -- 0.5 dex, based on the results from the training sample. Our achieved precision is comparable to or better than previous efforts using the entire XP spectra, and about three times better than our previous work based on Gaia EDR3 colors. This opens up new opportunities for investigations of stellar populations, the formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way, the chemistry of stars and star clusters, and the identification of candidate stars for subsequent high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>On Convective Turnover Times and Dynamos In Low-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between magnetic activity and Rossby number is one way through which stellar dynamos can be understood. Using measured rotation rates and X-ray to bolometric luminosity ratios of an ensemble of stars, we derive empirical convective turnover times based on recent observations and re-evaluate the X-ray activity-Rossby number relationship. In doing so, we find a sharp rise in the convective turnover time for stars in the mass range of $0.35-0.4\ \rm M_{\odot}$, associated with the onset of a fully convective internal stellar structure. Using $\texttt{MESA}$ stellar evolution models, we infer the location of dynamo action implied by the empirical convective turnover time. The empirical convective turnover time is found to be indicative of dynamo action deep within the convective envelope in stars with masses $0.1-1.2\ \rm M_{\odot}$, crossing the fully convective boundary. Our results corroborate past works suggesting that partially and fully convective stars follow the same activity-Rossby relation, possibly owing to similar dynamo mechanisms. Our stellar models also give insight into the dynamo mechanism. We find that empirically determined convective turnover times correlate with properties of the deep stellar interior. These findings are in agreement with global dynamo models that see a reservoir of magnetic flux accumulate deep in the convection zone before buoyantly rising to the surface.</description>

      <title>Re analysis of Temperature Dependent Neutron Capture Rates and Stellar \b{eta} decay Rates of 95 98Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron capture rates and temperature dependent stellar beta decay rates of Mo isotopes are investigated within the framework of the statistical code (Talys v1.96) and proton neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pnQRPA) models. The Maxwellian average cross section (MACS) and neutron capture rates for 95 98Mo(n,{\gamma}) 96 99Mo radiative capture processes are analyzed within the framework of statistical code Talys v1.96 based on the phenomenological nuclear level density (NLD) parameters and gamma strength functions (GSFs). The current model based computed data for MACS provide a good comparison with the existing measured data. The temperature dependent stellar \b{eta} decay rates of 95 98Mo are investigated at different densities within the framework of the pn-QRPA model. For the considered temperature range, the neutron capture rates were found to be higher, by orders of magnitude, than the stellar \b{eta} rates.</description>

      <title>Supersensitive seismic magnetometry on white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs (WDs) remains mysterious. Magnetic WDs are traditionally associated with field strengths $\gtrsim1\,\mathrm{MG}$, set by the sensitivity of typical spectroscopic magnetic field measurements. Informed by recent developments in red giant magnetoasteroseismology, we revisit the use of WD pulsations as a seismic magnetometer. WD pulsations primarily probe near-surface magnetic fields, whose effect on oscillation mode frequencies is to asymmetrize rotational multiplets and, if strong enough, suppress gravity-mode propagation altogether. The sensitivity of seismology to magnetic fields increases strongly with mode period and decreases quickly with the depth of the partial ionization-driven surface convective zone. We place upper limits for magnetic fields in $24$ pulsating WDs: $20$ hydrogen-atmosphere (DAV) and three helium-atmosphere (DBV) carbon-oxygen WDs, and one extremely low-mass (helium-core) pulsator. These bounds are typically $\sim1$-$10\,\mathrm{kG}$, although they can reach down to $\sim10$-$100\,\mathrm{G}$ for DAVs and helium-core WDs in which lower-frequency modes are excited. Seismic magnetometry may enable new insights into the formation and evolution of WD magnetism.</description>

      <title>Three-part structure of solar coronal mass ejection observed in low coronal signatures of Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between early solar coronal mass ejection (CME) propagation, the associated filament eruption, and coronal dimming in the rare event observed on March 28, 2022, which featured a three-part CME in the low corona of active region AR 12975, including a bright core/filament, dark cavity, and bright front edge. We employ 3D filament and CME shock reconstructions using data from SolO, STEREO-A, and SDO to track the filament's path, height, and kinematics. Our analysis across three viewpoints shows the outer front in SolO/EUI 304 \r{A} aligns with shock structures in STEREO-A/EUVI 195 \r{A}, showing a full 3D EUV wave dome, later matching the outer CME front in STEREO-A COR2. We introduce the method ATLAS-3D (Advanced Technique for single Line-of-sight Acquisition of Structures in 3D) and validate it against traditional approaches to reconstruct CME shock using SOLO data exclusively. Additionally, we estimate early CME propagation characteristics based on coronal dimming evolution with the DIRECD method. Results indicate that the filament height increased from 28 to 616 Mm (0.04 to 0.89 Rs) within 30 minutes (11:05 to 11:35 UT), reaching peak velocity of around 648 km/s and acceleration of around 1624 m/s$^2$. At 11:45 UT, the filament deflected by 12{\deg} to a height of 841 Mm (1.21 Rs), while the CME shock expanded from 383 to 837 Mm (0.55 to 1.2 Rs) over 10 minutes. Key parameters include a CME direction inclined by 6{\deg}, a 21{\deg} half-width, and a 1.12 Rs cone height at the dimming's impulsive phase end. This event demonstrates that expanding dimming correlates with early CME development, with the DIRECD method linking 2D dimming to 3D CME evolution. These insights underscore the value of multi-viewpoint observations and advanced reconstructions for improving space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>NSVS 3198272, a low-mass ratio contact binary, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report our study on a low-mass ratio contact binary system NSVS 3198272. We subjected our multi-filter ground-based photometry to the light curve numerical modeling using a modified Wilson-Devinney code. We present three scenarios fitting to the data best: a simple, non-spotted model, a model with a circumpolar spot and a model with a marginal third light. The first two models return similar physical properties which are comparable to the previously reported results on this object. In discussion section we are arguing for advocating the model with a circumpolar spot. At the and we are considering the impact of specific scenarios on the calculated physical parameters of contact binaries. In addition, we report a discovery of a new bright variable star, found by chance as a field star.</description>

      <title>The AH Pictoris syndrome: Continuous trains of stunted outbursts in novalike variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novalike variables are a subgroup of cataclysmic variables (CVs) that -- unlike dwarf novae -- do not exhibit strong brightenings in their long-term light curves. Variations over time scales of weeks, months or years are mostly restricted to irregular low-amplitude modulations. However, some of them occasionally suffer from so-called stunted outbursts, that is, small-scale brightenings of less than a magnitude lasting for a couple of days to weeks. There is no consensus about the physical mechanisms behind these outbursts. Here I discuss the common properties of a group of novalike variables (which I call AH~Pictoris stars after its most prominent member) that exhibit a continuous train of successive stunted outbursts over their entire observational history, or at least for several years. The outburst amplitudes are stable in a given system, always ranging between 0.5 and 1~mag in the visual band. The outburst intervals, at an overall range between 12 and 30 days, and the outburst profiles can gradually evolve, but no sudden changes are observed. On shorter time scales the orbital waveforms are not only surprisingly similar, but also evolve in the same way over the outburst cycle. All AH~Pic stars have absolute visual magnitudes in the overlap region between absolute magnitudes of all novalike variables and of quiescent dwarf novae above the CV period gap. So far, I identified seven novalike variables with the consistent photometric behavior which may be termed the AH~Pic syndrome. Several more systems may be related objects. The relationship to the anomalous Z~Cam stars is discussed.</description>

      <title>Interplanetary Rotation of 2021 December 4 CME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic orientation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is of great importance to understand their space weather effects. Although many evidences suggest that CMEs can undergo significant rotation during the early phases of evolution in the solar corona, there are few reports that CMEs rotate in the interplanetary space. In this work, we use multi-spacecraft observations and a numerical simulation starting from the lower corona close to the solar surface to understand the CME event on 2021 December 4, with an emphatic investigation of its rotation. This event is observed as a partial halo CME from the back side of the Sun by coronagraphs, and reaches the BepiColombo spacecraft and the MAVEN/Tianwen-1 as a magnetic flux rope-like structure. The simulation discloses that in the solar corona the CME is approximately a translational motion, while the interplanetary propagation process evidences a gradual change of axis orientation of the CME's flux rope-like structure. It is also found that the downside and the right flank of the CME moves with the fast solar wind, and the upside does in the slow-speed stream. The different parts of the CME with different speeds generate the nonidentical displacements of its magnetic structure, resulting in the rotation of the CME in the interplanetary space. Furthermore, at the right flank of the CME exists a corotating interaction region (CIR), which makes the orientation of the CME alter, and also deviates from its route due to the CME. These results provide new insight on interpreting CMEs' dynamics and structures during their travelling through the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>KIC 10855535: An elegant Delta Scuti pulsator with Amplitude and Phase Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the pulsating behavior of KIC 10855535 using Kepler 4-year long cadence data. Two independent frequencies were detected: a pulsation frequency F0 = 17.733260(5)d-1 and a low frequency f8=0.412643(8)d-1 We identify F0 as the fundamental frequency, at which a equidistant quintuplet is centered, suggesting that the star orbits in a binary system. The fitted orbital parameters align well with those reported in previous literature. Long-term phase modulation caused by binarity has been confirmed by considering TESS light curve. Through adjusting light time via removing the light time effect, we measured a linear change in period of order $\dot{P}/P \simeq 1.44\times 10^{-7}yr^{-1}$, a value that could be indicative of stellar evolution. The star also exhibits a gradual and stable amplitude growth, thereby raising the possibility of structural changes during its evolution. We attributed f8 and its two harmonics to rotation and surface spots, with further analysis suggesting evolving characteristics over time. Based on the hypothesis, KIC 10855535 may rotate slowly for its type, with a speed of 37(2)km/s. Overall, KIC 10855535 presents an exceptionally clean spectrum and a relatively slow rotation as a {\delta} Sct pulsator, exhibiting a single pulsation mode that undergoes both amplitude and phase modulation.</description>

      <title>Generative Simulations of The Solar Corona Evolution With Denoising Diffusion : Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar magnetized corona is responsible for various manifestations with a space weather impact, such as flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and, naturally, the solar wind. Modeling the corona's dynamics and evolution is therefore critical for improving our ability to predict space weather In this work, we demonstrate that generative deep learning methods, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), can be successfully applied to simulate future evolutions of the corona as observed in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. Our model takes a 12-hour video of an Active Region (AR) as input and simulate the potential evolution of the AR over the subsequent 12 hours, with a time-resolution of two hours. We propose a light UNet backbone architecture adapted to our problem by adding 1D temporal convolutions after each classical 2D spatial ones, and spatio-temporal attention in the bottleneck part. The model not only produce visually realistic outputs but also captures the inherent stochasticity of the system's evolution. Notably, the simulations enable the generation of reliable confidence intervals for key predictive metrics such as the EUV peak flux and fluence of the ARs, paving the way for probabilistic and interpretable space weather forecasting. Future studies will focus on shorter forecasting horizons with increased spatial and temporal resolution, aiming at reducing the uncertainty of the simulations and providing practical applications for space weather forecasting.

      <title>Magnetic activity in close binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal forces in close binary systems have diverse impacts on magnetic activity. The synchronicity characteristic of close systems counteracts magnetic braking, thereby sustaining rapid rotation-a key factor in increased levels of magnetic activity. Tidal effects can also work against the slowing down of rotation during stellar evolution, when the star inflates into a red giant. A notable manifestation of the effect of binarity on activity in such systems is the appearance of active longitudes, which are thought to arise from the excitation of non-axisymmetric dynamo modes. Through some recent examples, the dynamo operation in RS CVn and BY Dra type systems is briefly reviewed in terms of spot cycles, active longitudes, flare activity, and differential rotation.</description>

      <title>High-precision broadband linear polarimetry of early-type binaries. V. The Binary System HD 165052 in Open Cluster NGC 6530</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study continues our investigation of early-type binaries using high-precision broad-band polarimetry, focusing on HD 165052, a massive O+O-type binary in the young cluster NGC 6530. Our aim was to monitor linear polarization variations and independently determine the orbital period through polarization data analysis. By examining the phase-locked Stokes parameters, we estimated the orbital inclination at about 55+5/-55 deg, and the orientation at 148+20/-22 deg. The binary's rotation direction is clockwise. Using the Dipol-2 polarimeter with the 60 cm KVA and Tohoku T60 telescopes, we achieved polarization measurement accuracy around 0.01 percent in the B, V, and R passbands. Period analysis identified a strong periodic signal with a cycle of about 1.48 days, corresponding to half of the orbital period of about 2.96 days. The second Fourier harmonics suggest a symmetric scattering geometry, likely due to electron scattering in interacting stellar winds. Our estimates indicate a mass-loss rate of approximately 4.0 x 10^(-7) solar masses per year. Observations of neighboring stars in NGC 6530 revealed complex interstellar polarization behaviors within the cluster, enhancing our understanding of its polarimetric environment.</description>

      <title>A tell-tale tracer for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks: comparing the [CI] 8727 A line and ALMA observations in proplyds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of disks. These winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star forming-regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O i] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i] 8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i] lines are well detected in all these targets, there is &lt;&lt;10% detection rate in the case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a ~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation. The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-trace tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>

      <title>Observations of Magnetospheric Solar Wind Charge Exchange</title>

Abstract: The study of solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) emission is vital to both the X-ray astrophysics and heliophysics communities. SWCX emission contaminates all astrophysical observations in X-rays regardless of the direction. Ignoring this contribution to X-ray spectra can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the astrophysical plasmas along the line of sight due to the similar spectral distributions of SWCX and several common types of more distant astrophysical plasmas. Since its discovery, literature has distinguished between diffuse SWCX emission resulting from solar wind neutral interactions within the terrestrial magnetosphere, called magnetospheric SWCX, and similar interactions occurring more generally throughout the heliosphere, called heliospheric SWCX. Here, we build upon previous work validating a modeling method for the heliospheric SWCX contribution in X-ray spectra obtained with a medium resolution CubeSat instrument named HaloSat at low ecliptic latitudes. We now apply this model to a specially designed set of extended observations with the same instrument and successfully separate the spectral contributions of the astrophysical background and the heliospheric SWCX from the remaining contributions. Specifically, we find significant excess emission for four observations in the O VII emission line not explained by other sources, possibly indicative of magnetospheric SWCX. We discuss these results in comparison with simulation results publicly available through the Community Coordinated Modeling Center. We also report an absorbed high-temperature component in two of the twelve fields of view analyzed.</description>

      <title>SIROCCO: A Publicly Available Monte Carlo Ionization and Radiative Transfer Code for Astrophysical Outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outflows are critical components of many astrophysical systems, including accreting compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These outflows can significantly affect a system's evolution and alter its observational appearance by reprocessing the radiation produced by the central engine. Sirocco (Simulating Ionization and Radiation in Outflows Created by Compact Objects - or "the code formerly known as Python") is a Sobolev-based Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. It is designed to simulate the spectra produced by any system with an azimuthally-symmetric outflow, from spherical stellar winds to rotating, biconical accretion disc winds. Wind models can either be parametrized or imported, e.g. from hydrodynamical simulations. The radiation sources include an optically thick accretion disc and various central sources with flexible spectra and geometries. The code tracks the "photon packets" produced by the sources in any given simulation as they traverse and interact with the wind. The code assumes radiative near-equilibrium, so the thermal and ionization state can be determined iteratively from these interactions. Once the physical properties in the wind have converged, Sirocco can be used to generate synthetic spectra at a series of observer sightlines. Here, we describe the physical assumptions, operation, performance and limitations of the code. We validate it against tardis, cmfgen and cloudy, finding good agreement, and present illustrative synthetic spectra from disc winds in cataclysmic variables, tidal disruption events, AGN and X-ray binaries. Sirocco is publicly available on GitHub, alongside its associated data, documentation and sample input files covering a wide range of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf -- an average-energy explosion with circumstellar medium and a precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abridged: The fortunate proximity of the SN2023ixf allowed astronomers to follow its evolution from almost the moment of the collapse of the progenitor's core. SN2023ixf can be explained as an explosion of a massive star with an energy of 0.7e51 erg, however with a greatly reduced envelope mass, probably because of binary interaction. In our radiative-transfer simulations, the SN ejecta of 6 Msun interact with circumstellar material (CSM) of ~0.6 Msun extending to 1.e15 cm, which results in a light curve (LC) peak matching that of SN2023ixf. The origin of this required CSM might be gravity waves originating from convective shell burning, which could enhance wind-like mass-loss during the late stages of stellar evolution. The steeply rising, low-luminosity flux during the first hours after observationally confirmed non-detection, however, cannot be explained by the collision of the energetic SN shock with the CSM. Instead, we considered it as a precursor that we could fit by the emission from ~0.5 Msun of matter that was ejected with an energy of 1.e49 erg a fraction of a day before the main shock of the SN explosion reached the surface of the progenitor. The source of this energy injection into the outermost shell of the stellar envelope could also be dynamical processes related to the convective activity in the progenitor's interior or envelope. Alternatively, the early rise of the LC could point to the initial breakout of a highly non-spherical SN shock or of fast-moving, asymmetrically ejected matter that was swept out well ahead of the SN shock, potentially in a low-energy, nearly relativistic jet. We also discuss that pre-SN outbursts and LC precursors can be used to study or to constrain energy deposition in the outermost stellar layers by the decay of exotic particles, such as axions, which could be produced simultaneously with neutrinos in the newly formed, hot neutron star.</description>

      <title>Thermo-kinetic invariant in anisotropic plasma with heat fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate linear perturbations in an incompressible, weakly collisional, anisotropic plasma, taking heat fluxes into account. Our analysis identifies a new class of time-invariant perturbations that encompass heat flux variations and aperiodic longitudinal perturbations in the magnetic field and flow velocity. Under the Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) approximation, which neglects low-frequency heat flux effects, these perturbations are purely thermal and decoupled from magnetic and velocity fields. When heat fluxes are included, these perturbations gain kinematic and magnetic components, leading to the identification of a ``thermo-kinetic mode.''
  The nature of aperiodic linear modes suggests that they may reach higher amplitudes in perturbation structures, that can be revealed as filamentary formations. We discuss the potential implications of these filaments on the large-scale dynamics of flows and on the nonlinear energy balance within small-scale MHD turbulence. Our findings indicate that thermo-kinetic invariant may play a significant role in modulating turbulence energy transfer dynamics, potentially impacting both local and global flow behavior in weakly collisional anisotropic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Orbital-period Changes of Low-mass X-ray Binaries Driven by Magnetic Braking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in driving the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The modified MB prescription, convection and rotation boosted (CARB) model, is very successful in reproducing the detected mass-transfer rates of persistent neutron star (NS) LMXBs. In this work, we investigate whether the CARB MB prescription could account for the formation and evolution of some NS and black hole (BH) LMXBs with an observed orbital period derivative. Using the MESA code, we perform a detailed binary evolution model for six NS and three BH LMXBs. Our simulations find that the CARB MB prescription can successfully reproduce the observed donor-star masses, orbital periods, and period derivatives of four NS LMXBs and one BH LMXB. Our calculated effective temperatures are in good agreement with the detected spectral types of two NS LMXBs and one BH LMXB. However, the standard MB model is difficult to produce the observed period derivatives of those LMXBs experiencing a rapid orbital shrinkage or expansion.</description>

      <title>Detecting and sizing the Earth with PLATO: A feasibility study based on solar data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission will observe the same area of the sky continuously for at least two years in an effort to detect transit signals of an Earth-like planet orbiting a solar-like star.
  Aims. We aim to study how short-term solar-like variability caused by oscillations and granulation would affect PLATO's ability to detect and size Earth if PLATO were to observe the Solar System itself.
  Methods. We injected Earth-like transit signals onto real solar data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument. We isolated short-term stellar variability by removing any variability with characteristic timescales longer than five hours. We then added a noise model for a variety of different stellar magnitudes computed by PlatoSim assuming an observation by all 24 normal cameras. We first compared four different commonly used treatments of correlated noise in the time domain. We then tried to recover pairs of transit signals. Finally, we performed transit fits using realistic priors on planetary and stellar parameters.
  Results. We find that short-term solar-like variability affects the correct retrieval of Earth-like transit signals in PLATO data. Variability models accounting for variations with typical timescales at the order of one hour are sufficient to mitigate these effects. For bright targets (8.5 - 10.5 mag), the transit signal of an Earth analogue can reliably be detected in PLATO data. For faint targets the results of transit search algorithms have to be verified by transit-fitting algorithms to avoid false positive detections being flagged. For bright targets (V-mag $\leq$ 9.5), the radius of an Earth-like planet orbiting a solar-like star can be correctly determined at a precision of 3% or less, assuming that at least two transit events are observed and the characteristics of the host star are well understood.</description>

      <title>Mass-gap Black Holes in Coalescing Neutron Star Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a mass gap of $3-5\,M_{\odot}$ between the heaviest neutron stars (NSs) and the lightest black holes (BHs), inferred from the BH mass distribution in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), has been suggested for decades. The recently reported gravitational-wave source GW230529 has been confidently identified as a NSBH merger, with the BH mass falling within this lower mass gap. This detection provides strong evidence against the existence of the latter and introduces new implications for the coalescing NSBH population, including a revised BH mass distribution and an updated local merger rate. In this study, we employ POSYDON, a binary population synthesis code that integrates detailed single- and binary-star models, to investigate coalescing NSBH binaries formed through isolated binary evolution. In particular, we focus on the BH mass distribution of the intrinsic NSBH merger population. We find that, with a high common-envelope efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm{CE}} =2 $, the BH masses in NSBH mergers concentrate in the lower mass gap, aligning more closely with observations. However, after accounting for the constraints of the selection bias against mass-gap BHs in LMXBs, which suggests that the maximum NS birth mass is below $\simeq 2\,M_{\odot}$, we find that introducing a high $\alpha_{\rm{CE}}$ is not required to match observations. Additionally, we explore the impact of core-collapse supernova kicks. Finally, we present the property distributions of observable NSBH mergers from our simulation and find that they match well with the observations. We find that the fraction of electromagnetic counterparts in observable populations is $\approx 4-30\%$, depending on different NS equations of state. Future detections of coalescing NSBH binaries would provide invaluable insights into SN mechanisms, common envelope evolution, and NS physics.</description>

      <title>Unimolecular Chemical Kinetics in the Interstellar: Competition of Infrared Radiation and Collision Activation Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unimolecular gas phase chemical reactions could be activated by both infrared (IR) radiation and inter-molecular collision in the interstellar environment. Understanding the interplay and competition between the radiation and collision activation mechanisms is crucial for assessing accurate reaction rate constants with an appropriate model. In this work, guided by an extended version of Lindemann theory that considers the contribution of both the radiation-activation and collision-activation to the rate constant of unimolecular reactions, we show that the relative importance of the two mechanisms can be measured by a dimensionless number $PR$ that is the ratio of the collision frequency to the radiation absorption rate of the molecule. The reaction kinetic is dominated by collision-activation or by radiation activation depending on whether $PR$ is larger or smaller than a reference value $PR^*$, which is determined to be $PR^* \approx 10$ based on magnitudes of molecular properties and is verified by detailed calculations of a number of typical interstellar unimolecular reactions. This method of evaluating the relative importance of the two mechanisms is checked against master equation calculations of two interstellar reactions: the dissociation reaction of silicilic acid around the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and the methyl association in Titan's atmosphere, and the validity is verified. The method can be used in the future to help determine the appropriate and effective modeling approach for chemical reactions in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Probing red-supergiant atmospheres and winds with early-time high-cadence high-resolution type II supernova spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-cadence high-resolution spectroscopic observations of infant Type II supernovae (SNe) represent an exquisite probe of the atmospheres and winds of exploding red-supergiant (RSG) stars. Using radiation hydrodynamics and radiative transfer, we study the gas and radiation properties during and after the phase of shock breakout, considering RSG progenitors enshrouded within a circumstellar material (CSM) that varies in extent, density, and velocity profile. In all cases, the original, unadulterated CSM structure is probed only at the onset of shock breakout, visible in high-resolution spectra as narrow, often blueshifted emission, possibly with an absorption trough. As the SN luminosity rises during breakout, radiative acceleration of the unshocked CSM starts, leading to a broadening of the ``narrow'' lines by ~100 and up to ~1000km/s, depending on CSM properties. This acceleration is maximum close to the shock, where the radiative flux is greater, and thus typically masked by optical-depth effects. Generally, narrow-line broadening is greater for more compact, tenuous CSM because of the proximity to the shock where the flux is born, and smaller in denser and more extended CSM. Narrow-line emission should show a broadening that slowly increases first (the line forms further out in the original wind), then sharply rises (the line forms in a region that is radiatively accelerated), before decreasing until late times (the line forms further away in regions more weakly accelerated). Radiative acceleration should inhibit X-ray emission during the early, IIn phase. Although high spectral resolution is critical at the earliest times to probe the original slow wind, radiative acceleration and associated line broadening may be captured with medium resolution allowing a simultaneous view of narrow, Doppler-broadened as well as extended, electron-scattering broadened line emission.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) of the accreting X-ray pulsar Cen X-3 and significantly detect the 29 keV cyclotron line features in the hard X-ray averaged spectroscopy studies based on the recent Insight-HXMT observations in 2022, when Cen X-3 has X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X} &gt; \sim 5 \times 10^{37}$ erg\ s$^{-1}$ in the bands of 2 -- 60 keV. We do not find a harmonic line in the average spectra based on different continuum models. We showed that the CRSF energies have no correlation with time or luminosity in the average spectra. In addition, by performing a pulse phase-dependent spectral analysis, we revealed the fundamental line with the centroid energy ranging from 25 to 29 keV with a high significance over the spin phases. The evolution of the cyclotron line centroid energies over pulse phase is similar to the shape of pulse profiles, illustrating a positive correlation between the energy of CRSFs and the pulse phase flux.</description>

      <title>Planetary migration in wind-fed non-stationary accretion disks in binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accretion disk can be formed around a secondary star in a binary system when the primary companion leaves the Main sequence and starts to lose mass at an enhanced rate. We study the accretion disk evolution and planetary migration in wide binaries. We use a numerical model of a non-stationary alpha-disk with a variable mass inflow. We take into account that the low-mass disk has an extended region that is optically thin along the rotation axis. We consider irradiation by both the host star and the donor. The migration path of a planet in such a disk is determined by the migration rate varying during the disk evolution. Giants may open/close the gap several times over the disk lifetime. We identify the new type of migration specific to parts of the growing disk with a considerable radial gradient of an aspect ratio. Its rate is enclosed between the type 2 and the fast type 1 migration rates being determined by the ratio of time and radial derivatives of the disk aspect ratio. Rapid growth of the wind rate just before the envelope loss by the donor leads to the formation of a zone of decretion, which may lead to substantial outward migration. In binaries with an initial separation $a\lesssim 100$ AU migration becomes most efficient for planets with 60-80 Earth masses. This results in approaching a short distance from the host star where tidal forces become non-negligible. Less massive Neptune-like planets at the initial orbits $r_\mathrm{p} \lesssim 2$ AU can reach these internal parts in binaries with $a \lesssim 30$ AU. In binaries, mass loss by the primary component at late evolutionary stages can significantly modify the structure of a planetary system around the secondary component resulting in mergers of relatively massive planets with a host star.</description>

Abstract: Planet engulfment has been identified as one of the mechanisms for enhancing lithium abundance in stars. However, comprehensive investigations into lithium signatures following such events remain limited. Stars born together, sharing a common origin and stellar characteristics, provide a unique opportunity to study these signatures and compare lithium abundances. We demonstrate that the distinctive signature of planet engulfment in lithium abundance is only discernible among highly similar stellar twins. We present lithium abundance measurements for 125 co-moving pairs of stars, representing the largest sample to date with a single, homogeneous assessment of high-precision lithium abundance. While lithium abundance enhancements in pairs showing planet engulfment signatures are within 0.35 dex, we find that even at fixed stellar parameters (temperature and age), the intrinsic scatter in lithium abundance is typically 0.35 dex for G/F dwarfs and can be as large as 0.6 dex for older and cooler stars due to internal stellar evolution processes. Since the planet engulfment signature from lithium can be masked by stellar intrinsic scatter, our findings raise questions about relying solely on lithium as an indicator for planet engulfment or attributing lithium-richness in stars primarily to planet engulfment events.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra for the Photospheric Phase of a 3D Stripped-Envelope Supernova Explosion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present synthetic light curves and spectra from three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations based on a 3D core-collapse supernova explosion model of an ultra-stripped $3.5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ progenitor. Our calculations predict a fast and faint transient with $\Delta m_{15} \sim 1\texttt{-} 2\,\mathrm{mag}$ and peak bolometric luminosity between $-15.3\,\mathrm{mag}$ and $-16.4\,\mathrm{mag}$. Due to a large-scale unipolar asymmetry in the distribution of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, there is a pronounced viewing-angle dependence with about $1\,\mathrm{mag}$ difference between the directions of highest and lowest luminosity. The predicted spectra for this rare class of explosions do not yet match any observed counterpart. They are dominated by prominent Mg~II lines, but features from O, C, Si, and Ca are also found. In particular, the O~I line at \wl{7}{774} appears as a blended feature together with Mg~II emission. Our model is not only faster and fainter than the observed Ib/c supernova population, but also shows a correlation between higher peak luminosity and larger $\Delta m_{15}$ that is not present in observational samples. A possible explanation is that the unusually small ejecta mass of our model accentuates the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry. We suggest that the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry may be used to constrain asymmetries in explosion models of more typical stripped-envelope supernova progenitors in future.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Rays Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep learning framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the spectra of galactic cosmic rays by leveraging historical solar activity data, addressing the limitations of traditional transport models. By incorporating multiple solar parameters, such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The inclusion of historical cosmic-ray data enhances prediction accuracy, making the model highly effective for space weather forecasting. Moreover, it provides reliable one-day-ahead predictions of full spectra of cosmic rays for different species. Our approach surpasses traditional physics-based methods, providing a scalable, data-driven solution for reliable daily and long-term forecasts. This work paves the way for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>

      <title>Observation of O+ Characteristics During the Terrestrial Alfv\'en Wing State Induced by the April 2023 Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report Magnetospheric Multiscale observations of oxygen ions (O+) during a coronal mass ejection in April 2023 when the solar wind was sub-Alfv\'enic and Alfv\'en wings formed. For the first time, O+ characteristics are studied at the contact region between the unshocked solar wind and the magnetosphere. The O+ ions show energies between 100s eV and ~30 keV. The possible sources are the ring current, the warm plasma cloak, and the ionosphere. The O+ ions exhibit bi-directional streaming along newly-formed closed field lines (CFLs), and dominantly anti-parallel on earlier-formed CFLs. Escaping O+ ions in the unshocked solar wind are observed. During the recovery phase, the O+ pitch-angle distribution associated with flux tubes shows dispersion, indicating potential loss to the solar wind. Our results show escaping as well as trapped O+ ions in the region where a magnetic cloud, an Alfv\'en wing, and magnetospheric field lines are mixed.</description>

      <title>Formation of free-floating planetary mass objects via circumstellar disk encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of planetary mass objects (PMOs) wandering in young star clusters remains enigmatic, especially when they come in pairs. They could represent the lowest-mass object formed via molecular cloud collapse or high-mass planets ejected from their host stars. However, neither theory fully accounts for their abundance and multiplicity. Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridge between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in density clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by mutual gravity. PMOs may thus form a distinct population different from stars and planets.</description>

      <title>The VSPEC Collection: A suite of utilities to model spectroscopic phase curves of 3D exoplanet atmospheres in the presence of stellar variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Variable Star PhasE Curve (VSPEC) Collection, a set of Python packages for simulating combined-light spectroscopic observations of 3-dimensional exoplanet atmospheres in the presence of stellar variability and inhomogeneity. VSPEC uses the Planetary Spectrum Generator's Global Emission Spectra (PSG/GlobES) application along with a custom-built multi-component time-variable stellar model based on a user-defined grid of stellar photosphere models to produce spectroscopic light curves of the planet-host system. VSPEC can be a useful tool for modeling observations of exoplanets in transiting geometries (primary transit, secondary eclipse) as well as orbital phase curve measurements, and is built in a modular and flexible configuration for easy adaptability to new stellar and planetary model inputs. We additionally present a set of codes developed alongside the core VSPEC modules, including the stellar surface model generator vspec-vsm, the stellar spectral grid interpolation code GridPolator, and a Python interface for PSG, libpypsg.</description>

      <title>Investigating 39 Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars with VLTI/GRAVITY: Uncovering A Long Period Binary Desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are one of the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and immediate progenitors of stellar-mass black holes. Their multiplicity forms an important anchor point in single and binary population models for predicting gravitational-wave progenitors. Recent spectroscopic campaigns have suggested incompatible multiplicity fractions and period distributions for N- and C-rich Galactic WRs (WNs and WCs) at short as well as long orbital periods, in contradiction with evolutionary model predictions. In this work, we employed infrared interferometry using the $K$-band instrument GRAVITY at the VLTI to investigate the multiplicity of WRs at long periods and explore the nature of their companions. We present a survey of 39 Galactic WRs, including 11 WN, 15 WC and 13 H-rich WN (WNh) stars. We detected wide companions with GRAVITY for only four stars: WR 48, WR 89, WR 93 and WR 115. Combining with spectroscopic studies, we arrived at multiplicity fractions of $f^{\rm WN}_{\rm obs} = 0.55\pm0.15$, $f^{\rm WC}_{\rm obs} = 0.40\pm0.13$ and $f^{\rm WNh}_{\rm obs} = 0.23\pm0.12$. In addition, we also found other features in the GRAVITY dataset such as (i) a diffuse extended component in over half the WR sample; (ii) five known spectroscopic binaries resolved in differential phase data and (iii) spatially resolved winds in four stars: WR 16, WR 31a, WR 78 and WR 110. Our survey reveals a lack of intermediate (few 100s d) and long- (few years to decades) period WR systems. The 200-d peak in the period distributions of WR+OB and BH+OB binaries predicted by Case B mass-transfer binary evolution models is not seen in our data. The rich companionship of their O-type progenitors in this separation range suggest that the WR progenitor stars expand and interact with their companions, most likely through unstable mass-transfer, resulting in either a short-period system or a merger.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Discovery and Characterization Efficiency in the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will discover thousands of microlensing events across the Milky Way Galaxy, allowing for the study of populations of exoplanets, stars, and compact objects. We evaluate numerous survey strategies simulated in the Rubin Operation Simulations (OpSims) to assess the discovery and characterization efficiencies of microlensing events. We have implemented three metrics in the Rubin Metric Analysis Framework: a discovery metric and two characterization metrics, where one estimates how well the lightcurve is covered and the other quantifies how precisely event parameters can be determined. We also assess the characterizability of microlensing parallax, critical for detection of free-floating black hole lenses. We find that, given Rubin's baseline cadence, the discovery and characterization efficiency will be higher for longer duration and larger parallax events. Microlensing discovery efficiency is dominated by the observing footprint, where more time spent looking at regions of high stellar density including the Galactic bulge, Galactic plane, and Magellanic clouds, leads to higher discovery and characterization rates. However, if the observations are stretched over too wide an area, including low-priority areas of the Galactic plane with fewer stars and higher extinction, event characterization suffers by &gt; 10%. This could impact exoplanet, binary star, and compact object events alike. We find that some rolling strategies (where Rubin focuses on a fraction of the sky in alternating years) in the Galactic bulge can lead to a 15-20% decrease in microlensing parallax characterization, so rolling strategies should be chosen carefully to minimize losses.</description>

      <title>Antineutrino Opacity in Neutron Stars in the Models Constrained by Recent Terrestrial Experiments and Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate neutral current (NC) antineutrino scattering with the constituents of neutron star (NS) matter at zero temperature. The modeling of standard matter in NS is constructed within the framework of both extended relativistic mean-field (E-RMF) and nonrelativistic Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU energy density functional (KIDS-EDF) models. In the E-RMF model, we use a new parameter, G3(M), which was constrained by the recent PREX II experiment measurement of neutron distribution in $^{208}\rm{Pb}$, while the KIDS-EDF models are constrained by terrestrial experiments, gravitational-wave signals, and astrophysical observations. Using both realistic and well-constrained matter models, we then calculate the antineutrino differential cross-section (ADCS) and antineutrino mean free path (AMFP) for the interaction between antineutrinos and neutron star (NS) matter constituents using linear response theory. It is found that the AMFP for the KIDS0 and KIDSA models are smaller compared to the SLy4 model and the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. The AMFP result of the Skyrme model with the SLy4 parameter set is found to have a prediction almost similar to that of the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. Contributions of each nucleon to the total AMFP are also presented for the G3(M) model.</description>

      <title>The Flavor Composition of Supernova Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that standard matter effects in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae significantly constrain the flavor composition of the neutrino flux, even with the enormous uncertainties originating from self-induced flavor conversions in the supernova core. Assuming an arbitrary initial flavor composition emerging from the supernova core, we find that, for the normal mass ordering, the fraction of neutrinos with electron flavor reaching the Earth, denoted as $f_{\nu_e}$, is constrained to be less than $0.5$ for all energies throughout the emission phase, whereas, for inverted mass ordering, we anticipate neutrinos arriving in near flavor equipartition ($f_{\nu_e}\approx 1/3$). In case adiabaticity is violated in the region of standard matter effects (e. g. due to shock waves), the result is flavor equipartition for both mass orderings. These results could be tested by future observations and may provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrino fluxes emerging from the supernova core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint in explaining the experimental data on neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for those existing experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path as well as their totals, which is given by a sum of the Standard Model and nonstandard interaction.</description>

A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, and the locations of the two peaks are sensitive to the maximum value of $J_{\rm{sym}}$ reflecting the stiffness of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ above about 3 times the saturation density $\rho_0$ of SNM, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around $(2-3)\rho_0$.</description>

      <title>Echo Location: Distances to Galactic Supernovae From ASAS-SN Light Echoes and 3D Dust Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light echoes occur when light from a luminous transient is scattered by dust back into our line of sight with a time delay due to the extra propagation distance. We introduce a novel approach to estimating the distance to a source by combining light echoes with recent three-dimensional dust maps. We identify light echoes from the historical supernovae Cassiopeia A and SN 1572 (Tycho) in nearly a decade of imaging from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). Using these light echoes, we find distances of $3.6\pm0.1$ kpc and $3.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ kpc to Cas A and Tycho, respectively, which are generally consistent with previous estimates but are more precise. These distance uncertainties are primarily dominated by the low distance resolution of the 3D dust maps, which will likely improve in the future. The candidate single degenerate explosion donor stars B and G in Tycho are clearly foreground stars. Finally, the inferred reddening towards each SN agrees well with the intervening HI column density estimates from X-ray analyses of the remnants.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.</description>

      <title>Viewing the PLATO LOPS2 Field Through the Lenses of TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PLATO will begin observing stars in its Southern Field (LOPS2) after its launch in late 2026. By this time, TESS will have observed the stars in LOPS2 for at least four years. We find that by 2025, on average each star in the PLATO field will have been monitored for 330 days by TESS, with a subset of stars in the TESS continuous viewing zone having over 1000 days of monitoring. There are currently 101 known transiting exoplanets in the LOPS2 field, with 36 of these residing in multiplanet systems. The LOPS2 field also contains more than 500 TESS planet candidate systems, 64 exoplanets discovered by radial velocity only, over 1000 bright (V$&lt;$13) eclipsing binary systems, 7 transiting brown dwarf systems, and 2 bright white dwarfs (G$&lt;$13). We calculate TESS and PLATO sensitivities to detecting transits for the bright FGK stars that make up the PLATO LOPS2 P1 sample. We find that TESS should have discovered almost all transiting giant planets out to approximately 30 d within the LOPS2 field, and out to approximately 100 d for the regions of the LOPS2 field within the TESS CVZ ($\sim20$ per cent of the LOPS2 field). However, we find that for smaller radius planets in the range 1-4 R$_\oplus$ PLATO will have significantly better sensitivity, and these are likely to make up the bulk of new PLATO discoveries.</description>

      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes: collisional dynamics, binaries, and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>PRODIGE -- envelope to disk with NOEMA. IV. An infalling gas bridge surrounding two Class 0/I systems in L1448N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in the past decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is still not fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system, that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feeds the central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatial morphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3A and IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGE large program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Given the complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to three Gaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to disentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure. Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both the IRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwest direction and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pc towards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile is consistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towards IRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates a protostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolution continuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gas observations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scale mass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles. The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent with gravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.</description>
