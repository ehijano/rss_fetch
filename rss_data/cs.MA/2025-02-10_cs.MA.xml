      <title>Position: Emergent Machina Sapiens Urge Rethinking Multi-Agent Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificially intelligent (AI) agents that are capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across domains like transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in AI systems' design and deployment driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives introduces a crucial challenge: how can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to dynamically adjust their objectives, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through this paper, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these systems.</description>

      <title>$TAR^2$: Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution for Optimal Policy Preservation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), learning effective policies is challenging when global rewards are sparse and delayed. This difficulty arises from the need to assign credit across both agents and time steps, a problem that existing methods often fail to address in episodic, long-horizon tasks. We propose Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution $TAR^2$, a novel approach that decomposes sparse global rewards into agent-specific, time-step-specific components, thereby providing more frequent and accurate feedback for policy learning. Theoretically, we show that $TAR^2$ (i) aligns with potential-based reward shaping, preserving the same optimal policies as the original environment, and (ii) maintains policy gradient update directions identical to those under the original sparse reward, ensuring unbiased credit signals. Empirical results on two challenging benchmarks, SMACLite and Google Research Football, demonstrate that $TAR^2$ significantly stabilizes and accelerates convergence, outperforming strong baselines like AREL and STAS in both learning speed and final performance. These findings establish $TAR^2$ as a principled and practical solution for agent-temporal credit assignment in sparse-reward multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Online Learning for Multi-Agent Submodular Coordination: Tight Approximation and Communication Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating multiple agents to collaboratively maximize submodular functions in unpredictable environments is a critical task with numerous applications in machine learning, robot planning and control. The existing approaches, such as the OSG algorithm, are often hindered by their poor approximation guarantees and the rigid requirement for a fully connected communication graph. To address these challenges, we firstly present a $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ algorithm, which employs the multi-linear extension to transfer the discrete submodular maximization problem into a continuous optimization, thereby allowing us to reduce the strict dependence on a complete graph through consensus techniques. Moreover, $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ leverages a novel surrogate gradient to avoid sub-optimal stationary points. To eliminate the computationally intensive projection operations in $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$, we also introduce a projection-free $\textbf{MA-OSEA}$ algorithm, which effectively utilizes the KL divergence by mixing a uniform distribution. Theoretically, we confirm that both algorithms achieve a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{C_{T}T}{1-\beta}})$ against a $(\frac{1-e^{-c}}{c})$-approximation to the best comparator in hindsight, where $C_{T}$ is the deviation of maximizer sequence, $\beta$ is the spectral gap of the network and $c$ is the joint curvature of submodular objectives. This result significantly improves the $(\frac{1}{1+c})$-approximation provided by the state-of-the-art OSG algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through simulation-based multi-target tracking.</description>

      <title>Discrete GCBF Proximal Policy Optimization for Multi-agent Safe Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control policies that can achieve high task performance and satisfy safety constraints are desirable for any system, including multi-agent systems (MAS). One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose DGPPO, a new framework that simultaneously learns both a discrete graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a constant set of hyperparameters across all environments.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Traffic Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic assignment analyzes traffic flows in road networks that emerge due to traveler interaction. Traditionally, travelers are assumed to use private cars, so road costs grow with the number of users due to congestion. However, in sustainable transit systems, travelers share vehicles s.t. more users on a road lead to higher sharing potential and reduced cost per user. Thus, we invert the usual avoidant traffic assignment (ATA) and instead consider synergistic traffic assignment (STA) where road costs decrease with use.
  We find that STA is significantly different from ATA from a game-theoretical point of view. We show that a simple iterative best-response method with simultaneous updates converges to an equilibrium state. This enables efficient computation of equilibria using optimized speedup techniques for shortest-path queries. In contrast, ATA requires slower sequential updates or more complicated iteration schemes that only approximate an equilibrium. Experiments with a realistic scenario for the city of Stuttgart indicate that STA indeed quickly converges to an equilibrium. We envision STA as a part of software-defined transportation systems that dynamically adapt to current travel demand. As a first demonstration, we show that an STA equilibrium can be used to incorporate traveler synergism in a simple bus line planning algorithm to potentially greatly reduce the required vehicle resources.</description>

      <title>Assigning Credit with Partial Reward Decoupling in Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. However, MAPPO still struggles with the credit assignment problem, wherein the sheer difficulty in ascribing credit to individual agents' actions scales poorly with team size. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that adapts recent developments in credit assignment to improve upon MAPPO. Our approach leverages partial reward decoupling (PRD), which uses a learned attention mechanism to estimate which of a particular agent's teammates are relevant to its learning updates. We use this estimate to dynamically decompose large groups of agents into smaller, more manageable subgroups. We empirically demonstrate that our approach, PRD-MAPPO, decouples agents from teammates that do not influence their expected future reward, thereby streamlining credit assignment. We additionally show that PRD-MAPPO yields significantly higher data efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to both MAPPO and other state-of-the-art methods across several multi-agent tasks, including StarCraft II. Finally, we propose a version of PRD-MAPPO that is applicable to \textit{shared} reward settings, where PRD was previously not applicable, and empirically show that this also leads to performance improvements over MAPPO.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Effect Decomposition in Multi-Agent Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their "intrinsic" contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.</description>

      <title>HyperMARL: Adaptive Hypernetworks for Multi-Agent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptability is critical in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents must learn specialised or homogeneous behaviours for diverse tasks. While parameter sharing methods are sample-efficient, they often encounter gradient interference among agents, limiting their behavioural diversity. Conversely, non-parameter sharing approaches enable specialisation, but are computationally demanding and sample-inefficient. To address these issues, we propose HyperMARL, a parameter sharing approach that uses hypernetworks to dynamically generate agent-specific actor and critic parameters, without altering the learning objective or requiring preset diversity levels. By decoupling observation- and agent-conditioned gradients, HyperMARL empirically reduces policy gradient variance and facilitates specialisation within FuPS, suggesting it can mitigate cross-agent interference. Across multiple MARL benchmarks involving up to twenty agents -- and requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours -- HyperMARL consistently performs competitively with fully shared, non-parameter-sharing, and diversity-promoting baselines, all while preserving a behavioural diversity level comparable to non-parameter sharing. These findings establish hypernetworks as a versatile approach for MARL across diverse environments.</description>
