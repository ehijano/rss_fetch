      <title>Operational solutions for the generalized Fokker-Planck and generalized diffusion-wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution operator method is used to solve the generalized Fokker-Planck equations and the generalized diffusion-wave equations in the (1+1) dimensional space in which $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$. These equations contain either the first- or the second-time derivatives smeared by memory functions, each of which forms an integral kernel (denoted by $f(\xi, t)$, $\xi\in\mathbb{R}_+$) of suitable evolution operators. If memory functions in the Laplace space are Stieltjes functions, then $f(\xi, t)$ satisfy normalization, non-negativity, and infinite divisibility to be considered a probability density function. The evolution operators also contain exponential-like operators whose action on initial condition $p_0(x) &gt; 0$ leads to the parent process distribution functions. This makes the results fully analogous to those obtained within the standard subordination approach. The above conclusion is satisfied by the solution of the generalized Fokker-Planck equation. In the case of the generalized diffusion-wave equation, to get this property, we should employ a special class, namely "diffusion-like" initial conditions. The key models of the operator method involve power-law memory functions. It leads to the characterization of $f(\xi, t)$ by applying one-sided stable L\'{e}vy distributions. The article also examines the properties of evolution operators in terms of evolution and self-reproduction.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of principal chiral model from solutions of associative Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <title>Calculus with combinatorial differential forms for fluid flow analysis in porous and fractured media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabric of porous and fractured media contains solid regions (grains) and voids. The space conducting fluids is a system of connected voids with variable geometries. Relative to the grain sizes, the voids can be voluminous with three comparable large extensions, narrow expansive with two comparable large extensions and one smaller extension, and thin long with one comparable large extension and two smaller extensions. The widely used representation of void spaces by systems of spheres connected by cylinders (pore network models) is an acceptable approximation for some special cases, but not for most porous and fractured media. We propose a flexible method for modelling such media by mapping their measured fabric's characteristics - void and grain volume distributions and shapes - onto polyhedral tessellations of space. The map assigns voluminous voids and grains to polyhedrons (3D), narrow expansive voids to some polyhedral faces (2D), and thin long voids to some polyhedral edges (1D), as dictated by experimental data. The analysis of transport through such discrete structures with components of different dimensions is performed by a novel mathematical method, which uses combinatorial differential forms to represent physical properties and their fluxes, as well as structure-preserving operators on such forms to formulate the conservation laws exactly and directly in matrix form, ready for computation. The method allows for individual material properties, such as conductivity, to be assigned to voids of all dimensions, so that the three types of voids are suitably represented. Publicly available XCT images of four different rocks are used to test the method.</description>

      <title>SUSY design of smooth quantum rings in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a suitable technique to design zero-energy graphene models with radial electrostatic potentials capable of achieving electrostatic confinement. Using the Gaussian law for electrostatics, we derive the charge density associated with these potentials that correspond to concentric electrostatic rings. The technique is based on a modified supersymmetric transformation that allows to design time-reversal invariant interaction terms and to find the corresponding zero-energy bound states in analytical form. Consequently, solutions with the same probability density but different angular momentum are characterized by circular probability currents flowing in opposite directions. The energies of the systems defined in two Dirac valleys (one-valley) have a fourfold (twofold) degeneracy. As an example of the technique, we construct a ring-decorated Coulomb potential that exhibits zero energy collapse and bound states together.</description>

      <title>Isochronous oscillator with a singular position-dependent mass and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the equation $\ddot{x} - (1/2x) \dot{x}^2 + 2 \omega^2 x - 1/8x = 0$, where $\omega &gt; 0$ and $x = x(t)$ is a real-valued variable. We first discuss the appearance of this equation from a position-dependent-mass scenario in which the mass profile goes inversely with $x$, admitting a singularity at $x = 0$. The associated potential is also singular at $x = 0$, splitting the real axis into two halves, i.e., $x &gt; 0$ and $x &lt; 0$. The dynamics is exactly solvable for both the branches and so for definiteness, we stick to the $x &gt; 0$ branch. Performing a canonical quantization in the position representation and upon employing the ordering strategy of the kinetic-energy operator due to von Roos, we show that the problem is isospectral with the isotonic oscillator. Thus, the quantum spectrum consists of an infinite number of equispaced levels which is in line with the expectation that classical systems that support isochronous oscillations are associated in their quantized versions with equally-spaced spectra. The spacing between energy levels is found to be insensitive to the specific choices of the ambiguity parameters that are employed for ordering the kinetic-energy operator \`a la von Roos.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces an advanced novel theory for calculating non-linear Newtonian hydrostatic perturbations in the density, shape, and gravitational field of fluid stars and planets subjected to external tidal and rotational forces. The theory employs a Lie group approach using exponential mappings to derive exact differential equations for large gravitational field perturbations and the shape function, which describes the finite deformation of the body's figure. This approach lays the foundation for the precise analytic determination and numerical computation of the induced body's multipole moments and Love numbers with any desired degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Kummer Construction of Calabi-Yau and Hyper-K\"{a}hler Metrics on the $K3$ Surface, and Large Families of Volume Non-collapsed Limiting Compact Hyper-K\"{a}hler Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Right after Yau's resolution of the Calabi conjecture in the late 1970s, physicists Page and Gibbons-Pope conjectured that one may approximate Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metrics on the $K3$ surface with metrics having "almost special holonomy" constructed via "resolving" the $16$ orbifold singularities of a flat $\mathbb{T}^{4}/\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ with Eguchi-Hanson metrics. Constructions of such metrics with special holonomy from such a "gluing" construction of approximate special holonomy metrics have since been called "Kummer constructions" of special holonomy metrics, and their proposal was rigorously carried out in the 1990s by Kobayashi and LeBrun-Singer, and in the 2010s by Donaldson.
  In this paper, we provide two new rigorous proofs of Page-Gibbons-Pope's proposal based on singular perturbation and weighted function space analysis. Each proof is done from a different perspective:
  * solving the complex Monge-Ampere equation (Calabi-Yau)
  * perturbing closed definite triples (hyper-K\"{a}hler)
  Both proofs yield Eguchi-Hanson metrics as ALE bubbles/rescaled limits. Moreover, our analysis in the former perspective yields estimates which improve Kobayashi's estimates, and our analysis in the latter perspective results in the construction of large families of Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metrics on the $K3$ surface, yielding the full $58$ dimensional moduli space of such. Finally, as a byproduct of our analysis, we produce a plethora of large families of compact hyper-K\"{a}hler orbifolds which all arise as volume non-collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff limit spaces of the aforementioned constructed large families of Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metrics on the $K3$ surface. Moreover, these compact hyper-K\"{a}hler orbifolds are explicitly exhibited as points in the "holes" of the moduli space of Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics on $K3$ under the period map.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural class of extensions of the Anderson model on $\mathbb Z^d$, called random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSO), which feature a random block potential. They are defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ and take the form $H=V+\lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a diagonal block matrix with diagonal blocks that are i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ GUE, $\Psi$ describes the interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter. We focus on three specific RBSOs: the block Anderson model, where $\Psi$ is the Laplacian operator on $\mathbb Z^d$; the Anderson orbital model, where $\Psi$ is a block Laplacian operator; the Wegner orbital model, where the nearest-neighbor blocks of $\Psi$ are random matrices. Let $\Lambda_\Psi$ denote the strength of interaction between two neighboring blocks. Assuming $d\ge 7$ and $W\ge L^\epsilon$ for a small constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, under the condition $ W^{d/4}/\Lambda_\Psi\ll\lambda\ll 1$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for the bulk eigenvectors, as well as a quantum diffusion estimate for the Green's function. Together with the localization result proved in arXiv:1608.02922, our results rigorously establish an Anderson localization-delocalization transition of RBSOs as $\lambda$ varies.
  Our proof is based on a nontrivial extension of the $T$-expansion method and the concept of self-energy renormalization developed for random band matrices in arXiv:2104.12048. Additionally, we explore a conceptually new idea called coupling renormalization. This phenomenon extends the self-energy renormalization and is prevalent in quantum field theory, yet it is identified here for the first time within the context of random Schr\"odinger operators. We anticipate that our techniques can be adapted to real or non-Gaussian block potentials and more general interactions $\Psi$.</description>

      <title>Transport theory in moderately anisotropic plasmas: I, Collisionless aspects of axisymmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel transport theory, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, is presented for scenarios when velocity space exhibits axisymmetry. In this theory, the transport equations are derived from the 1D-2V Vlasov equation, employing the Spherical harmonics expansions (SHE) coupled with the King function expansion (KFE) in velocity space. The characteristic parameter equations (CPEs) are provided based on the King mixture model (KMM), serving as the constraint equations of the transport equations. It is a nature process to present the closure relations of transport equations based on SHE and KFE, successfully providing a kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM). This model is typically a nonlinear system, effective for moderately anisotropic nonequilibrium plasmas.</description>

      <title>On the Lyapunov exponent for the random field Ising transfer matrix, in the critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the top Lyapunov exponent of a product of random $2 \times 2$ matrices appearing in the analysis of several statistical mechanical models with disorder, extending a previous treatment of the critical case (Giacomin and Greenblatt, ALEA 19 (2022), 701-728) by significantly weakening the assumptions on the disorder distribution. The argument we give completely revisits and improves the previous proof. As a key novelty we build a probability that is close to the Furstenberg probability, i.e. the invariant probability of the Markov chain corresponding to the evolution of the direction of a vector in ${\mathbb R}^2$ under the action of the random matrices, in terms of the ladder times of a centered random walk which is directly related to the random matrix sequence. We then show that sharp estimates on the ladder times (renewal) process lead to a sharp control on the probability measure we build and, in turn, to the control of its distance from the Furstenberg probability.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of continuous frames, with a particular focus on phase retrieval and norm retrieval in the context of Hilbert spaces. We introduce the concept of continuous near-Riesz bases and prove their invariance under invertible operators. Some equivalent conditions for phase and norm retrieval property of continuous frames are presented. We study the stability of phase retrieval under perturbations. Furthermore, tensor product frames for separable Hilbert spaces are studied, and we establish the equivalence of phase retrieval and norm retrieval properties between components and their tensor products.</description>

      <title>Topological Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconducting quantum rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum rings have emerged as a playground for quantum mechanics and topological physics, with promising technological applications. Experimentally realizable quantum rings, albeit at the scale of a few nanometers, are 3D nanostructures. Surprisingly, no theories exist for the topology of the Fermi sea of quantum rings, and a microscopic theory of superconductivity in nanorings is also missing. In this paper, we remedy this situation by developing a mathematical model for the topology of the Fermi sea and Fermi surface, which features non-trivial hole pockets of electronic states forbidden by quantum confinement, as a function of the geometric parameters of the nanoring. The exactly solvable mathematical model features two topological transitions in the Fermi surface upon shrinking the nanoring size either, first, vertically (along its axis of revolution) and, then, in the plane orthogonal to it, or the other way round. These two topological transitions are reflected in a kink and in a characteristic discontinuity, respectively, in the electronic density of states (DOS) of the quantum ring, which is also computed. Also, closed-form expressions for the Fermi energy as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring are provided. These, along with the DOS, are then used to derive BCS equations for the superconducting critical temperature of nanorings as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring. The $T_c$ varies non-monotonically with the dominant confinement size and exhibits a prominent maximum, whereas it is a monotonically increasing function of the other, non-dominant, length scale. For the special case of a perfect square toroid (where the two length-scales coincide), the $T_c$ increases monotonically with increasing the confinement size, and in this case, there is just one topological transition.</description>

      <title>Cut-and-join operators in cohomological field theory and topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a cubic cut-and-join operator description for the partition function of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion for a local spectral curve with simple ramification points. In particular, this class contains partition functions of all semi-simple cohomological field theories. The cut-and-join description leads to an algebraic version of topological recursion. For the same partition functions we also derive N families of the Virasoro constraints and prove that these constraints, supplemented by a deformed dimension constraint, imply the cut-and-join description.</description>

      <title>BKP-Affine Coordinates and Emergent Geometry of Generalized Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten Tau-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Zhou's framework, we consider the emergent geometry of the generalized Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten models whose partition functions are known to be a family of tau-functions of the BKP hierarchy. More precisely, we construct a spectral curve together with its special deformation, and show that the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion on this spectral curve emerges naturally from the Virasoro constraints for the generalized BGW tau-functions. Moreover, we give the explicit expressions for the BKP-affine coordinates of these tau-functions and their generating series. The BKP-affine coordinates and the topological recursion provide two different approaches towards the concrete computations of the connected $n$-point functions. Finally, we show that the quantum spectral curve of type $B$ in the sense of Gukov-Su{\l}kowski emerges from the BKP-affine coordinates and Eynard-Orantin topological recursion.</description>

      <title>Operator Norm Bounds on the Correlation Matrix of the SK Model at High Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the two point correlation matrix $ \textbf{M}= (\langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle)_{1\leq i,j\leq N} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model has the property that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $K_\epsilon&gt;0$, that is independent of $N$, such that
  \[ \mathbb{P}\big( \| \textbf{M} \|_{\text{op}} \leq K_{\epsilon}\big) \geq 1- \epsilon \] for $N$ large enough, for suitable interaction and external field parameters $(\beta,h)$ in the replica symmetric region. In other words, the operator norm of $\textbf{M}$ is of order one with high probability. Our results are in particular valid for all $ (\beta,h)\in (0,1)\times (0,\infty) $ and thus complement recently obtained results in \cite{EAG,BSXY} that imply the operator norm boundedness of $\textbf{M}$ for all $\beta&lt;1$ in the special case of vanishing external field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a finite system of hard spheres that collide inelastically according to a particular model, losing a fixed amount of kinetic energy at each collision. We develop the theory of the Transport-Collision-Transport (TCT) dynamics, which allows to study precisely the evolution of the Lebesgue measure in the phase space under the action of the flows of particle systems that can interact via instantaneous binary collision. We show that the scattering mapping associated to the inelastic hard sphere system we introduce preserves locally the Lebesgue measure in the velocity space, in spite of the fact that a positive amount of kinetic energy is lost at each inelastic collision. We prove the analog of Alexander's theorem for our model, which allows us to deduce the global well-posedness of the trajectories, for almost every initial datum.</description>

      <title>Twists of superconformal algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of "conformal twists" of superconformal field theories in dimensions 3 to 6, extending the well-known analysis of twists for supersymmetric theories. The conformal twists describe all possible inequivalent choices of a nilpotent element in the superconformal algebra. Such twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we only discuss these subtleties in a few special cases. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras.</description>

      <title>Segal-Bargmann transforms and generalized Weyl algebras associated with the Meixner class of orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meixner (1934) proved that there exist exactly five classes of orthogonal Sheffer sequences: Hermite polynomials which are orthogonal with respect to Gaussian distribution, Charlier polynomials orthogonal with respect to Poisson distribution, Laguerre polynomials orthogonal with respect to gamma distribution, Meixner polynomials of the first kind, orthogonal with respect to negative binomial distribution, and Meixner polynomials of the second kind, orthogonal with respect to Meixner distribution. The Segal-Bargmann transform provides a unitary isomorphism between the $L^2$-space of the Gaussian distribution and the Fock or Segal-Bargmann space of entire functions. This construction was also extended to the case of the Poisson distribution. The present paper deals with the latter three classes of orthogonal Sheffer sequences. By using a set of nonlinear coherent states, we construct a generalized Segal-Bargmann transform which is a unitary isomorphism between the $L^2$-space of the orthogonality measure and a certain Fock space of entire functions. In a special case, such a Fock space was already studied by Alpay-Jorgensen-Seager-Volok (2013) and Alpay-Porat (2018). To derive our results, we use normal ordering in generalized Weyl algebras that are naturally associated with the orthogonal Sheffer sequences.</description>

Abstract: Using the correspondence between solutions to the SU(n+1) Toda system on a Riemann surface and totally unramified unitary curves, we show that a spherical metric $\omega$ generates a family of solutions, including $(i(n+1-i)\omega)_{i=1}^n$. Moreover, we characterize this family in terms of the monodromy group of the spherical metric. As a consequence, we obtain a new solution class to the SU(n+1) Toda system with cone singularities on compact Riemann surfaces, complementing the existence results of Lin-Yang-Zhong (JDG, 114(2):337-391, 2020).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale dynamics of the solution to a nonlinear stochastic heat equation (SHE) in dimensions $d \geq 3$ with long-range dependence. This equation is driven by multiplicative Gaussian noise, which is white in time and coloured in space with non-integrable spatial covariance that decays at the rate of $|x|^{-\kappa}$ at infinity, where $\kappa \in (2, d)$. Inspired by recent studies on SHE and KPZ equations driven by noise with compactly supported spatial correlation, we demonstrate that the correlations persist in the large-scale limit. The fluctuations of the diffusively scaled solution converge to the solution of a stochastic heat equation with additive noise whose correlation is the Riesz kernel of degree $-\kappa$. Moreover, the fluctuations converge as a distribution-valued process in the optimal H\"older topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue investigation of asymptotics of quantum differential equation for Fano manifolds, with a special regard to Gamma conjecture I and its underlying Conjecture $\mathcal{O}$. We introduce the A-model conifold value, a symplectic invariant of a Fano manifold, and propose modifications for Gamma conjecture I based on this new definition. We discuss an interplay of birational transformations with an extension of Gamma conjecture I over the K\"ahler moduli space. These heuristics are applied to rigorously identify the principal asymptotic class in the case of $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles $X_n=\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{P}^{n}}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{O}(n))$. We observe, in particular, that for $X_n$ of dimension at least four, the Conjecture $\mathcal{O}$ holds just for even values of $n$, and in these cases we falsify the original non-modified Gamma conjecture I.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method to analytically prove global stability in ghost-ridden dynamical systems. Our proposal encompasses all prior results and consequentially extends them. In particular, we show that stability can follow from a conserved quantity that is unbounded from below, contrary to expectation. Novel examples illustrate all our results. Our findings take root on a careful examination of the literature, here comprehensively reviewed for the first time. This work lays the mathematical basis for ulterior extensions to field theory and quantization, and it constitutes a gateway for inter-disciplinary research in dynamics and integrability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kinetic moment-closed model, derived from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation with spherically symmetric velocity space, is introduced as a general relaxation model for homogeneous plasma. The closed form of this model is presented by introducing a set new functions called $R$ function and $R$ integration. This nonlinear model, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, allows the ability to capture the nature of equilibrium state. From this relaxation model, a general temperature relaxation model is derived and the general characteristic frequency of temperature relaxation when velocity space exhibits spherical symmetry is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric field theories can be characterized by their Nicolai map, which is a nonlinear and nonlocal field transformation to their free-field limit. The systematic construction of such maps has recently been outlined for actions with power more than two in the fermions, which produces a perturbative expansion in loop-decorated fermionic tree diagrams. We thoroughly investigate the nonlinear $\mathbb C P^1$ sigma model in ($3{+}1$)-dimensional Minkowski space as a paradigmatical example. We construct and test a chiral form of the Nicolai map, to third order in the coupling, including all (regularized) quantum parts. In addition, all trees with one or two edges are summed up. The free-action condition determines only the one-edge part of the map. We resolve the fermion loop decoration of the Nicolai trees by injecting an auxiliary vector field and present the ensuing classical Nicolai map to second order in a dimensionful coupling.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the generic problem of state preparation for open quantum systems. As is well known, open quantum systems can be simulated by quantum trajectories described by a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. In this context, the state preparation problem becomes a stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem. The SOC problem requires the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is generally challenging to solve. A notable exception are the so-called path integral (PI) control problems for which one can estimate the optimal control solution by sampling. We derive a class of quantum state preparation problems that can be solved with PI control. We name the resulting algorithm Quantum Diffusion Control (QDC). By only requiring the propagation of state vectors $\psi$, QDC presents a quadratic advantage over density-centered approaches, such as PMP-based methods. Unlike most conventional quantum control algorithms, it does not require computing gradients of the cost function to determine the optimal control. Instead, it is computed by iterative importance sampling. The SOC setting allows in principle for a state feedback control solution, whereas Lindblad-based methods are restricted to open-loop control. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through some examples of open loop control for single- and multi-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>The complete non-perturbative partition function of minimal superstring theory and JT supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact convergent expression for the partition function of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ $(2,4k)$ minimal superstring theory with type 0B GSO projection in the ungapped phase by leveraging the duality between this theory and a double-scaled unitary matrix integral. Taking the $k\rightarrow\infty$ limit, we also obtain the complete partition function of $\mathcal{N}=1$ JT supergravity, including all contributions associated with "doubly non-perturbative" effects. We discover that the fundamental objects of the string theory are a linear combination of the standard FZZT branes which we call F-branes, along with their charge-conjugate partners which we call anti-F-branes. Summing over the disk and cylinder diagram contributions of the F-branes and anti-F-branes and integrating over their moduli space completely reproduces our expression for the partition function from the matrix integral side of the duality. We show that the string theory can be expressed precisely in the formalism of dressed free fermions and we propose a Hilbert space interpretation of our results. We present exact expressions for the matrix integral correlators of the double-scaled eigenvalue density.</description>

Abstract: There are now many examples of gapped fracton models, which are defined by the presence of restricted-mobility excitations above the quantum ground state. However, the theory of fracton orders remains in its early stages, and the complex landscape of examples is far from being mapped out. Here we introduce the class of planon-modular (p-modular) fracton orders, a relatively simple yet still rich class of quantum orders that encompasses several well-known examples of type I fracton order. The defining property is that any non-trivial point-like excitation can be detected by braiding with planons. From this definition, we uncover a significant amount of general structure, including the assignment of a natural number (dubbed the weight) to each excitation of a p-modular fracton order. We identify simple new phase invariants, some of which are based on weight, which can easily be used to compare and distinguish different fracton orders. We also study entanglement renormalization group (RG) flows of p-modular fracton orders, establishing a close connection with foliated RG. We illustrate our general results with an analysis of several exactly solvable fracton models that we show to realize p-modular fracton orders, including Z_n versions of the X-cube, anisotropic, checkerboard, 4-planar X-cube and four color cube (FCC) models. We show that each of these models is p-modular and compute its phase invariants. We also show that each example admits a foliated RG at the level of its non-trivial excitations, which is a new result for the 4-planar X-cube and FCC models. We show that the Z_2 FCC model is not a stack of other better-studied models, but predict that the Z_n FCC model with n odd is a stack of 10 4-planar X-cubes, possibly plus decoupled layers of 2d toric code. We also show that the Z_n checkerboard model for n odd is a stack of three anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>Wehrl inequalities for matrix coefficients of holomorphic discrete series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Wehrl-type $L^2(G)-L^{p}(G)$ inequalities for matrix coefficients of vector-valued holomorphic discrete series of $G$, for even integers $p=2n$. The optimal constant is expressed in terms of Harish-Chandra formal degrees for the discrete series. We prove the maximizers are precisely the reproducing kernels.</description>

      <title>Reality conditions for sine-Gordon equation and quasi-periodic solutions in finite phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic solutions of the sine-Gordon equation are expressed in terms of $\wp_{1,2g-1}$-function, and reality conditions are completely determined. This new result
  leads to numerical computation and graphical representation of non-linear wave solutions. A way of obtaining finite-gap solutions by means of algebro-geometric integration is also explained, and a construction of the sine-Gordon hierarchy on coadjoint orbits of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ loop group is addressed.</description>
