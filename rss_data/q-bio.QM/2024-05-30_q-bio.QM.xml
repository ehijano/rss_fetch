      <title>The association between neighborhood obesogenic factors and prostate cancer risk and mortality: the Southern Community Cohort Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality among men in the U.S. We examined the role of neighborhood obesogenic attributes on prostate cancer risk and mortality in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). From 34,166 SCCS male participants, 28,356 were included in the analysis. We assessed relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) and neighborhood obesogenic environment indices including restaurant environment index, retail food environment index, parks, recreational facilities, and businesses and prostate cancer risk and mortality by controlling for individual-level factors using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. We further stratified prostate cancer risk analysis by race and body mass index (BMI). Median follow-up time was 133 months, and mean age was 51.62 years. There were 1,524 (5.37%) prostate cancer diagnoses and 98 (6.43%) prostate cancer deaths during follow-up. Compared to participants residing in wealthiest quintile, those residing in the poorest quintile had a higher risk of prostate cancer, particularly among non-obese men with a BMI less than 30. The restaurant environment index was associated with a higher prostate cancer risk in overweight (BMI equal or greater 25) White men. Obese Black individuals without any neighborhood recreational facilities had a 42% higher risk compared to those with any access. Compared to residents in wealthiest quintile and most walkable area, those residing within the poorest quintile or the least walkable area had a higher risk of prostate cancer death.</description>

      <title>Adapting Differential Molecular Representation with Hierarchical Prompts for Multi-label Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular properties is critical in the field of drug discovery. However, existing methods do not fully consider the fact that molecules in the real world usually possess multiple property labels, and complex high-order relationships may exist among these labels. Therefore, molecular representation learning models should generate differential molecular representations that consider multi-granularity correlation information among tasks. To this end, our research introduces a Hierarchical Prompted Molecular Representation Learning Framework (HiPM), which enhances the differential expression of tasks in molecular representations through task-aware prompts, and utilizes shared information among labels to mitigate negative transfer between different tasks. HiPM primarily consists of two core components: the Molecular Representation Encoder (MRE) and the Task-Aware Prompter (TAP). The MRE employs a hierarchical message-passing network architecture to capture molecular features at both the atomic and motif levels, while the TAP uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering to build a prompt tree that reflects the affinity and distinctiveness of tasks, enabling the model to effectively handle the complexity of multi-label property predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiPM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multi-label datasets, offering a new perspective on multi-label molecular representation learning.</description>

      <title>Categorization of 31 computational methods to detect spatially variable genes from spatially resolved transcriptomics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data, detecting spatially variable genes (SVGs) is crucial. Numerous computational methods exist, but varying SVG definitions and methodologies lead to incomparable results. We review 31 state-of-the-art methods, categorizing SVGs into three types: overall, cell-type-specific, and spatial-domain-marker SVGs. Our review explains the intuitions underlying these methods, summarizes their applications, and categorizes the hypothesis tests they use in the trade-off between generality and specificity for SVG detection. We discuss challenges in SVG detection and propose future directions for improvement. Our review offers insights for method developers and users, advocating for category-specific benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Domain adaptation in small-scale and heterogeneous biological datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques are steadily becoming more important in modern biology, and are used to build predictive models, discover patterns, and investigate biological problems. However, models trained on one dataset are often not generalizable to other datasets from different cohorts or laboratories, due to differences in the statistical properties of these datasets. These could stem from technical differences, such as the measurement technique used, or from relevant biological differences between the populations studied. Domain adaptation, a type of transfer learning, can alleviate this problem by aligning the statistical distributions of features and samples among different datasets so that similar models can be applied across them. However, a majority of state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods are designed to work with large-scale data, mostly text and images, while biological datasets often suffer from small sample sizes, and possess complexities such as heterogeneity of the feature space. This Review aims to synthetically discuss domain adaptation methods in the context of small-scale and highly heterogeneous biological data. We describe the benefits and challenges of domain adaptation in biological research and critically discuss some of its objectives, strengths, and weaknesses through key representative methodologies. We argue for the incorporation of domain adaptation techniques to the computational biologist's toolkit, with further development of customized approaches.</description>

      <title>Injecting Hierarchical Biological Priors into Graph Neural Networks for Flow Cytometry Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the complex landscape of hematologic samples such as peripheral blood or bone marrow derived from flow cytometry (FC) data, cell-level prediction presents profound challenges. This work explores injecting hierarchical prior knowledge into graph neural networks (GNNs) for single-cell multi-class classification of tabular cellular data. By representing the data as graphs and encoding hierarchical relationships between classes, we propose our hierarchical plug-in method to be applied to several GNN models, namely, FCHC-GNN, and effectively designed to capture neighborhood information crucial for single-cell FC domain. Extensive experiments on our cohort of 19 distinct patients, demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical biological constraints boosts performance significantly across multiple metrics compared to baseline GNNs without such priors. The proposed approach highlights the importance of structured inductive biases for gaining improved generalization in complex biological prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>UniIF: Unified Molecule Inverse Folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecule inverse folding has been a long-standing challenge in chemistry and biology, with the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and material science. Despite specified models have been proposed for different small- or macro-molecules, few have attempted to unify the learning process, resulting in redundant efforts. Complementary to recent advancements in molecular structure prediction, such as RoseTTAFold All-Atom and AlphaFold3, we propose the unified model UniIF for the inverse folding of all molecules. We do such unification in two levels: 1) Data-Level: We propose a unified block graph data form for all molecules, including the local frame building and geometric feature initialization. 2) Model-Level: We introduce a geometric block attention network, comprising a geometric interaction, interactive attention and virtual long-term dependency modules, to capture the 3D interactions of all molecules. Through comprehensive evaluations across various tasks such as protein design, RNA design, and material design, we demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all tasks. UniIF offers a versatile and effective solution for general molecule inverse folding.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization in Protein Fitness Landscapes Using Reinforcement Learning in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are complex molecules responsible for different functions in nature. Enhancing the functionality of proteins and cellular fitness can significantly impact various industries. However, protein optimization using computational methods remains challenging, especially when starting from low-fitness sequences. We propose LatProtRL, an optimization method to efficiently traverse a latent space learned by an encoder-decoder leveraging a large protein language model. To escape local optima, our optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process using reinforcement learning acting directly in latent space. We evaluate our approach on two important fitness optimization tasks, demonstrating its ability to achieve comparable or superior fitness over baseline methods. Our findings and in vitro evaluation show that the generated sequences can reach high-fitness regions, suggesting a substantial potential of LatProtRL in lab-in-the-loop scenarios.</description>

      <title>A vision transformer-based framework for knowledge transfer from multi-modal to mono-modal lymphoma subtyping models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining lymphoma subtypes is a crucial step for better patient treatment targeting to potentially increase their survival chances. In this context, the existing gold standard diagnosis method, which relies on gene expression technology, is highly expensive and time-consuming, making it less accessibility. Although alternative diagnosis methods based on IHC (immunohistochemistry) technologies exist (recommended by the WHO), they still suffer from similar limitations and are less accurate. Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis using deep learning models has shown promising potential for cancer diagnosis, that could offer cost-effective and faster alternatives to existing methods. In this work, we propose a vision transformer-based framework for distinguishing DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma) cancer subtypes from high-resolution WSIs. To this end, we introduce a multi-modal architecture to train a classifier model from various WSI modalities. We then leverage this model through a knowledge distillation process to efficiently guide the learning of a mono-modal classifier. Our experimental study conducted on a lymphoma dataset of 157 patients shows the promising performance of our mono-modal classification model, outperforming six recent state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the power-law curve, estimated on our experimental data, suggests that with more training data from a reasonable number of additional patients, our model could achieve competitive diagnosis accuracy with IHC technologies. Furthermore, the efficiency of our framework is confirmed through an additional experimental study on an external breast cancer dataset (BCI dataset).</description>
