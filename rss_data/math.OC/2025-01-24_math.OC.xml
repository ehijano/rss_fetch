      <title>Semantics of Instability in Networked Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a scheduling problem in the context of a cyber-physical system where a sensor and a controller communicate over an unreliable channel. The sensor observes the state of a source at each time, and according to a scheduling policy determines whether to transmit a compressed sampled state, transmit the uncompressed sampled state, or remain idle. Upon receiving the transmitted information, the controller executes a control action aimed at stabilizing the system, such that the effectiveness of stabilization depends on the quality of the received sensory information. Our primary objective is to derive an optimal scheduling policy that optimizes system performance subject to resource constraints, when the performance is measured by a dual-aspect metric penalizing both the frequency of transitioning to unstable states and the continuous duration of remaining in those states. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process, and derive an optimal multi-threshold scheduling policy.</description>

      <title>On the Instability of Nesterov's ODE under Non-Conservative Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the instability properties of Nesterov's ODE in non-conservative settings, where the driving term is not necessarily the gradient of a potential function. While convergence properties under Nesterov's ODE are well-characterized for optimization settings with gradient-based driving terms, we show that the presence of arbitrarily small non-conservative terms can lead to instability, a phenomenon previously observed empirically via numerical studies in optimization and game-theoretic problems. Our instability analysis combines multi-time scale techniques, such as averaging via variations of constants formula, and Floquet Theory, focusing on systems where the vector field is linear and its Helmholtz decomposition reveals a non-vanishing non-conservative component. To stabilize the dynamics under non-vanishing non-conservative components, we study a regularization mechanism based on restarting. The resulting system is a hybrid dynamical system that mirrors Nesterov's ODE during intervals of flow, and implements resets of the momentum state through discrete periodic jumps. For this hybrid system, we establish novel explicit bounds on the resetting period that ensure the decrease of a suitable Lyapunov function, guaranteeing not only stability but also "accelerated" convergence rates under suitable smoothness and strong monotonicity properties on the driving term. Numerical simulations support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Practical Considerations for Implementing Robust-to-Early Termination Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is widely used to achieve performance objectives, while enforcing operational and safety constraints. Despite its high performance, MPC often demands significant computational resources, making it challenging to implement in systems with limited computing capacity. A recent approach to address this challenge is to use the Robust-to-Early Termination (REAP) strategy. At any time instant, REAP converts the MPC problem into the evolution of a virtual dynamical system whose trajectory converges to the optimal solution, and provides guaranteed sub-optimal and feasible solution whenever its evolution is terminated due to limited computational power. REAP has been introduced as a continuous-time scheme and its theoretical properties have been derived under the assumption that it performs all the computations in continuous time. However, REAP should be practically implemented in discrete-time. This paper focuses on the discrete-time implementation of REAP, exploring conditions under which anytime feasibility and convergence properties are maintained when the computations are performed in discrete time. The proposed methodology is validated and evaluated through extensive simulation and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Controllability scores of linear time-varying network systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For large-scale network systems, network centrality based on control theory plays a crucial role in understanding their properties and controlling them efficiently. The controllability score is such a centrality index and can give a physically meaningful measure. Nevertheless, the existing work is limited to linear time-invariant systems and the controllability score cannot be applied to linear time-varying systems, which include essential models such as temporal networks for real application. This paper extends it to apply to linear time-varying systems. Since it is defined as an optimal solution to some optimization problem, it is not necessarily uniquely determined. Its uniqueness must be guaranteed for reproducibility and interpretability. This paper also shows its uniqueness in most practical cases, which guarantees its use as a network centrality. In addition, we propose a data-driven method to compute it for its practical use. Finally, in numerical experiments, we compare controllability scores between LTI and LTV systems and assess the performance of the proposed data-driven method.</description>

      <title>Comments and extensions on "State-equivalent form and minimum-order compensator design for rectangular descriptor systems'"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical note presents a counterexample showing that the equivalence conditions proposed by Geng et al. (IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 2024), which use a minimum-order compensator (MOC) to achieve desired designs, including generalized regularity or both generalized regularity and free of impulse, are sufficient but not necessary. Furthermore, revised equivalence conditions are introduced, along with an equivalence condition ensuring the closed-loop system remains generalized regular, impulse-free, and stable using MOC. Additionally, it is shown that output feedback can replace the MOC, achieving the same design without increasing dimensionality. These findings are validated through a circuit example.</description>

      <title>Dual Regularization and Outer Approximation of Optimal Control Problems in BV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an elliptic optimal control problem with total variation (TV) restriction on the control in the constraints. We introduce a regularized optimal control problem by applying a quadratic regularization of the dual representation of the TV-seminorm. The regularized optimal control problem can be solved by means of an outer approximation algorithm. Convergence of the regularization for vanishing regularization parameter as well as convergence of the outer approximation algorithm is proven. Moreover, we derive necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the original unregularized optimal control problem and use these to construct an exact solution that we use in our numerical experiments to confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Duality Theorems and Vector Measures in Optimal Transportation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal transportation problem, first suggested by Gaspard Monge in the 18th century and later revived in the 1940s by Leonid Kantorovich, deals with the question of transporting a certain measure to another, using transport maps or transport plans that minimize the total cost of transportation. This problem is very popular since it has a variety of applications in economics, physics, computer science and more.
  One of the main tools in this theory is the duality theorem, which states that the optimal total cost equals the value of a different optimization problem called the dual problem.
  In this work, I show how the problem and duality theorem can be generalized to an abstract formulation, in which I omit the use of measures. I show how this generalization implies a wide range of different optimal transport problems, and even other problems from game theory, linear programming and functional analysis.
  In particular, I show how the optimal transport problem can be generalized to deal with vector measures as a result of the abstract theorem and discuss the properties of this problem: I present its corresponding duality theorem and formulate conditions for the existence of transport plans, transport maps and solutions to the dual problem.</description>

      <title>Semismooth Newton Methods for Risk-Averse Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by semismooth Newton methods, we propose a general framework for designing solution methods with convergence guarantees for risk-averse Markov decision processes. Our approach accommodates a wide variety of risk measures by leveraging the assumption of Markovian coherent risk measures. To demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of this framework, we design three distinct solution methods, each with proven convergence guarantees and competitive empirical performance. Validation results on benchmark problems demonstrate the competitive performance of our methods. Furthermore, we establish that risk-averse policy iteration can be interpreted as an instance of semismooth Newton's method. This insight explains its superior convergence properties compared to risk-averse value iteration. The core contribution of our work, however, lies in developing an algorithmic framework inspired by semismooth Newton methods, rather than evaluating specific risk measures or advocating for risk-averse approaches over risk-neutral ones in particular applications.</description>

      <title>Line planning under crowding: A cut-and-column generation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem definition: To mitigate excessive crowding in public transit networks, network expansion is often not feasible due to financial and time constraints. Instead, operators are required to make use of existing infrastructure more efficiently. In this regard, this paper considers the problem of determining lines and frequencies in a public transit system, factoring in the impact of crowding. Methodology: We introduce a novel formulation to address the line planning problem under crowding and propose a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MI-SOCP) reformulation. Three variants of the cut-and-column generation algorithm with tailored acceleration techniques find near-system-optimal solutions by dynamically generating passenger routes and adding linear cutting planes to deal with the non-linearity introduced by the crowding terms. We find integral solutions using a diving heuristic. In practice, passengers may deviate from system-optimal routes. We, thus, evaluate line plans by computing a user-equilibrium routing based on Wardrop's first principle. Results and implications: We experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches on both an artificial network and the Beijing metro network. The results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively scales to large-scale instances involving hundreds of stations and candidate lines, and nearly 57,000 origin-destination pairs. We find that considering crowding while developing line plans can significantly reduce crowding, at only a minor expense to the travel time passengers experience. This holds both for system-optimal passenger routing and user-optimal passenger routing, which only differ slightly.</description>

      <title>Sample-Based Piecewise Linear Power Flow Approximations Using Second-Order Sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent nonlinearity of the power flow equations poses significant challenges in accurately modeling power systems, particularly when employing linearized approximations. Although power flow linearizations provide computational efficiency, they can fail to fully capture nonlinear behavior across diverse operating conditions. To improve approximation accuracy, we propose conservative piecewise linear approximations (CPLA) of the power flow equations, which are designed to consistently over- or under-estimate the quantity of interest, ensuring conservative behavior in optimization. The flexibility provided by piecewise linear functions can yield improved accuracy relative to standard linear approximations. However, applying CPLA across all dimensions of the power flow equations could introduce significant computational complexity, especially for large-scale optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a strategy that selectively targets dimensions exhibiting significant nonlinearities. Using a second-order sensitivity analysis, we identify the directions where the power flow equations exhibit the most significant curvature and tailor the CPLAs to improve accuracy in these specific directions. This approach reduces the computational burden while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly well-suited for mixed-integer programming problems involving the power flow equations.</description>

      <title>A space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imposing additional constraints on low-rank optimization has garnered growing interest. However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The ``space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Globally Convergent Method for Computing B-stationary Points of Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method that globally converges to B-stationary points of mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) in a finite number of iterations. B-stationarity is necessary for optimality and means that no feasible first-order direction improves the objective. Given a feasible point of an MPEC, B-stationarity can be certified by solving a linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPEC) constructed at this point. The proposed method solves a sequence of LPECs, which either certify B-stationarity or provide an active-set estimate for the complementarity constraints, and nonlinear programs (NLPs) - referred to as branch NLPs (BNLPs) - obtained by fixing the active set in the MPEC. A BNLP is more regular than the MPEC, easier to solve, and with the correct active set, its solution coincides with the solution of the MPEC. The method has two phases: the first phase identifies a feasible BNLP or certifies local infeasibility, and the second phase solves a finite sequence of BNLPs until a B-stationary point of the MPEC is found. The paper provides a detailed convergence analysis and discusses implementation details. In addition, extensive numerical experiments and an open-source software implementation are provided. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust and faster than relaxation-based methods, while also providing a certificate of B-stationarity without requiring the usual too-restrictive assumptions.</description>

      <title>On Supportedness in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses an inconsistency in various definitions of supported non-dominated points within multi-objective combinatorial problems (MOCO). MOCO problems are known to contain supported and unsupported non-dominated points, with the latter typically outnumbering the former. Supported points are, in general, easier to determine, can serve as representations, and are used in two-phase methods to generate the entire non-dominated point set. Despite their importance, several different characterizations for supported efficient solutions (and supported non-dominated points) are used in the literature.
  While these definitions are equivalent for multi-objective linear problems, they can yield different sets of supported non-dominated points for MOCO problems. We show by an example that these definitions are not equivalent for MOCO or general multi-objective optimization problems. Moreover, we analyze the structural and computational properties of the resulting sets of supported non-dominated points. These considerations motivate us to summarize equivalent definitions and characterizations for supported efficient solutions and to introduce a distinction between supported and weakly supported efficient solutions.</description>

      <title>On the Almost Sure Convergence of the Stochastic Three Points Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic three points (STP) algorithm is a derivative-free optimization technique designed for unconstrained optimization problems in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we analyze this algorithm for three classes of functions: smooth functions that may lack convexity, smooth convex functions, and smooth functions that are strongly convex. Our work provides the first almost sure convergence results of the STP algorithm, alongside some convergence results in expectation. For the class of smooth functions, we establish that the best gradient iterate of the STP algorithm converges almost surely to zero at a rate arbitrarily close to $o(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Furthermore, within the same class of functions, we establish both almost sure convergence and convergence in expectation of the final gradient iterate towards zero. For the class of smooth convex functions, we establish that $f(\theta^T)$ converges to $\inf_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(\theta)$ almost surely at a rate arbitrarily close to $o(\frac{1}{T})$, and in expectation at a rate of $O(\frac{d}{T})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the space. Finally, for the class of smooth functions that are strongly convex, we establish that when step sizes are obtained by approximating the directional derivatives of the function, $f(\theta^T)$ converges to $\inf_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(\theta)$ in expectation at a rate of $O((1-\frac{\mu}{dL})^T)$, and almost surely at a rate arbitrarily close to $o((1-\frac{\mu}{dL})^T)$, where $\mu$ and $L$ are the strong convexity and smoothness parameters of the function.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Ambiguity Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model-free preference under ambiguity, as a primitive trait of behavior, which we apply once as well as repeatedly. Its single and double application yield simple, easily interpretable definitions of ambiguity aversion and ambiguity prudence. We derive their implications within canonical models for decision under risk and ambiguity. We establish in particular that our new definition of ambiguity prudence is equivalent to a positive third derivative of: (i) the capacity in the Choquet expected utility model, (ii) the dual conjugate of the divergence function under variational divergence preferences and (iii) the ambiguity attitude function in the smooth ambiguity model. We show that our definition of ambiguity prudent behavior may be naturally linked to an optimal insurance problem under ambiguity.</description>

      <title>A car-following model with behavioural adaptation to road geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the effect of road geometry on human driving behaviour is essential for both road safety studies and traffic microsimulation. Research on this topic is still limited, mainly focusing on free-flow traffic and not adequately considering the influence of curvature on car-following dynamics. This work attempts to investigate this issue and model the adaptation of car-following behaviour to horizontal curvature. For this purpose, the maximum desired speed - which mainly determines the free-flow dynamics - is expressed as a parsimonious function of the curvature. A spatial anticipation mechanism is also included in order to realistically describe the driving behaviour when approaching or exiting from curves. The accuracy of the augmented model is evaluated using the Modified Intelligent Driver Model (M-IDM) and trajectory data from free-flow and car-following traffic (Naples data and Zen Traffic Data). The results show that a significant improvement is achieved in free-flow dynamics. In car-following situations, improvements are mainly observed at high speed and are dependent on the observed driver. Overall, the analysis highlights the lack of sufficiently spatially extended trajectory data to calibrate and evaluate such driving behaviours.</description>

      <title>Remote State Estimation over Unreliable Channels with Unreliable Feedback: Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with networked estimation in a system composed of a source that is observed by a sensor, a remote monitor that needs to estimate the state of the source in real time, and a communication channel that connects the source to the monitor. The source is a partially observable dynamical process, and the communication channel is a packet-erasure channel with feedback. Our main objective is to obtain the fundamental performance limits of the underlying networked system in the sense of a causal tradeoff between the packet rate and the mean square error when both forward and backward channels are unreliable. We characterize an optimal coding policy profile consisting of a scheduling policy for the encoder and an estimation policy for the decoder. We complement our theoretical results with a numerical analysis, and compare the performance limits of the networked system in different communication regimes.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Robot Action Planning in the Presence of Unconcerned Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robot action planning scheme that provides an efficient and probabilistically safe plan for a robot interacting with an unconcerned human -- someone who is either unaware of the robot's presence or unwilling to engage in ensuring safety. The proposed scheme is predictive, meaning that the robot is required to predict human actions over a finite future horizon; such predictions are often inaccurate in real-world scenarios. One possible approach to reduce the uncertainties is to provide the robot with the capability of reasoning about the human's awareness of potential dangers. This paper discusses that by using a binary variable, so-called danger awareness coefficient, it is possible to differentiate between concerned and unconcerned humans, and provides a learning algorithm to determine this coefficient by observing human actions. Moreover, this paper argues how humans rely on predictions of other agents' future actions (including those of robots in human-robot interaction) in their decision-making. It also shows that ignoring this aspect in predicting human's future actions can significantly degrade the efficiency of the interaction, causing agents to deviate from their optimal paths. The proposed robot action planning scheme is verified and validated via extensive simulation and experimental studies on a LoCoBot WidowX-250.</description>

      <title>Markovian Search with Socially Aware Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a general class of sequential search problems for selecting multiple candidates from different societal groups under "ex-ante constraints" aimed at producing socially desirable outcomes, such as demographic parity, diversity quotas, or subsidies for disadvantaged groups. Starting with the canonical Pandora's box model [Weitzman, 1978] under a single affine constraint on selection and inspection probabilities, we show that the optimal constrained policy retains an index-based structure similar to the unconstrained case, but may randomize between two dual-based adjustments that are both easy to compute and economically interpretable. We then extend our results to handle multiple affine constraints by reducing the problem to a variant of the exact Carath\'eodory problem and providing a novel polynomial-time algorithm to generate an optimal randomized dual-adjusted index-based policy that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. Building on these insights, we consider richer search processes (e.g., search with rejection and multistage search) modeled by joint Markov scheduling (JMS) [Dumitriu et al., 2003; Gittins, 1979]. By imposing general affine and convex ex-ante constraints, we develop a primal-dual algorithm that randomizes over a polynomial number of dual-based adjustments to the unconstrained JMS Gittins indices, yielding a near-feasible, near-optimal policy. Our approach relies on the key observation that a suitable relaxation of the Lagrange dual function for these constrained problems admits index-based policies akin to those in the unconstrained setting. Using a numerical study, we investigate the implications of imposing various constraints, in particular the utilitarian loss (price of fairness), and whether these constraints induce their intended societally desirable outcomes.</description>

      <title>Fast and Provable Tensor-Train Format Tensor Completion via Precondtioned Riemannian Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank tensor completion aims to recover a tensor from partially observed entries, and it is widely applicable in fields such as quantum computing and image processing. Due to the significant advantages of the tensor train (TT) format in handling structured high-order tensors, this paper investigates the low-rank tensor completion problem based on the TT-format. We proposed a preconditioned Riemannian gradient descent algorithm (PRGD) to solve low TT-rank tensor completion and establish its linear convergence. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the PRGD algorithm. On the simulated dataset, the PRGD algorithm reduced the computation time by two orders of magnitude compared to existing classical algorithms. In practical applications such as hyperspectral image completion and quantum state tomography, the PRGD algorithm significantly reduced the number of iterations, thereby substantially reducing the computational time.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Stochastic Distributed Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address distributed learning problems, both nonconvex and convex, over undirected networks. In particular, we design a novel algorithm based on the distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address the challenges of high communication costs, and large datasets. Our design tackles these challenges i) by enabling the agents to perform multiple local training steps between each round of communications; and ii) by allowing the agents to employ stochastic gradients while carrying out local computations. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to a neighborhood of a stationary point, for nonconvex problems, and of an optimal point, for convex problems. We also propose a variant of the algorithm to incorporate variance reduction thus achieving exact convergence. We show that the resulting algorithm indeed converges to a stationary (or optimal) point, and moreover that local training accelerates convergence. We thoroughly compare the proposed algorithms with the state of the art, both theoretically and through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Small-time local controllability of a KdV system for all critical lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the small-time local controllability problem for the KdV system on an interval with a Neumann boundary control. In 1997, Rosier discovered that the linearized system is uncontrollable if and only if the length is critical, namely $L=2\pi\sqrt{(k^2+ kl+ l^2)/3}$ for some integers $k$ and $l$.
  Coron and Cr\'epeau (2003) proved that the nonlinear system is small-time locally controllable even if the linearized system is not, provided that $k= l$ is the only solution pair. Later, Cerpa and Crepeau showed that the system is large-time locally controllable for all critical lengths. In 2020, Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen found that the system is not small-time locally controllable if $2k+l\not \in 3\mathbb{N}^*$.
  We demonstrate that if the critical length satisfies $2k+l \in 3\mathbb{N}^*$ with $k\neq l$, then the system is not small-time locally controllable. This paper, together with the above results, gives a complete answer to the longstanding open problem on the small-time local controllability of KdV on all critical lengths since the pioneer work by Rosier</description>

Abstract: We are interested in the feedback stabilization of general linear multi-dimensional first order hyperbolic systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Using a Lyapunov function with a suited weight function depending on the system under consideration we show stabilization in $L^2$ for the studied system using a suitable feedback control. Therefore the controllability of the studied system is related to the feasibility of an associated linear matrix inequality.We show the applicability discussing the barotropic Euler equations.</description>

Abstract: Stabilization of partial differential equations is a topic of utmost importance in mathematics as well as in engineering sciences. Concerning one dimensional problems there exists a well developed theory. Due to numerous important applications the interest in boundary feedback control of multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems is increasing. In the present work we want to discuss the relation between some of the most recent results available in the literature. The key result of the present work is to show that the type of system discussed in Yang and Yong (2024) identifies a particular class which falls into the framework presented in Herty and Thein (2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polytopic autoencoders provide low-di\-men\-sion\-al parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it improves on standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems. We discuss how the particular architecture enables exact representation of target states and higher order series expansions of the nonlinear feedback law at little extra computational effort in the online phase and how the linear though high-dimensional and nonstandard Lyapunov equations are efficiently computed during the offline phase. In a numerical study, we illustrate the procedure and how this approach can reliably outperform the standard linear-quadratic regulator design.</description>

      <title>Output Feedback Periodic-Event and Self-Triggered Control of Coupled $2\times 2$ Linear Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand recently introduced observer-based periodic event-triggered control (PETC) and self-triggered control (STC) schemes for reaction-diffusion PDEs to boundary control of $2\times2$ coupled hyperbolic PDEs in canonical form and with anti-collocated measurement and actuation processes. The class of problem under study governs transport phenomena arising in water management systems, oil drilling, and traffic flow, to name a few. Relative to the state of the art in observer-based event-triggered control of hyperbolic PDEs, our contribution goes two steps further by proposing observer-based PETC and STC for the considered class of systems. These designs arise from a non-trivial redesign of an existing continuous-time event-triggered control (CETC) scheme. PETC and STC eliminate the need for constant monitoring of an event-triggering function as in CETC; PETC requires only periodic evaluations of the triggering function for event detection, whereas STC is a predictor-feedback that anticipates the next event time at the current event exploiting continuously accessible output measurements. The introduced resource-aware designs act as input holding mechanisms allowing for the update of the input signal only at events. Subject to the designed boundary output feedback PETC and STC control laws characterized by a set of event-trigger design parameters, the resulting closed-loop systems, which are inherently Zeno-free by design, achieve exponential convergence to zero in the spatial $L^2$ norm. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach by applying the control laws to the linearized Saint-Venant model, which describes the dynamics of shallow water waves in a canal and is used to design flow stabilizer feedback laws via gate actuation. The provided simulation results illustrate the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization for Cardinality-Constrained Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random forests are among the most famous algorithms for solving classification problems, in particular for large-scale data sets. Considering a set of labeled points and several decision trees, the method takes the majority vote to classify a new given point. In some scenarios, however, labels are only accessible for a proper subset of the given points. Moreover, this subset can be non-representative, e.g., due to collection bias. Semi-supervised learning considers the setting of labeled and unlabeled data and often improves the reliability of the results. In addition, it can be possible to obtain additional information about class sizes from undisclosed sources. We propose a mixed-integer linear optimization model for computing a semi-supervised random forest that covers the setting of labeled and unlabeled data points as well as the overall number of points in each class for a binary classification. Since the solution time rapidly grows as the number of variables increases, we present some problem-tailored preprocessing techniques and an intuitive branching rule. Our numerical results show that our approach leads to a better accuracy and a better Matthews correlation coefficient for biased samples compared to random forests by majority vote, even if only few labeled points are available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of mini-batch gradient descent to semiflows (gradient flows). Given a loss function (potential), we introduce a continuous version of mini-batch gradient descent by randomly selecting sub-loss functions over time, defining a piecewise flow. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on the potential generating the semiflow, the \textit{mini-batch descent flow} trajectory closely approximates the original semiflow trajectory on average. In addition, we study a randomized minimizing movement scheme that also approximates the semiflow of the full loss function. We illustrate the versatility of this approach across various problems, including constrained optimization, sparse inversion, and domain decomposition. Finally, we validate our results with several numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a proximal variable smoothing algorithm for nonsmooth optimization problem with sum of three functions involving weakly convex composite function. The proposed algorithm is designed as a time-varying forward-backward splitting algorithm with two steps: (i) a time-varying forward step with the gradient of a smoothed surrogate function, designed with the Moreau envelope, of the sum of two functions; (ii) the backward step with a proximity operator of the remaining function. For the proposed algorithm, we present a convergence analysis in terms of a stationary point by using a newly smoothed surrogate stationarity measure. As an application of the target problem, we also present a formulation of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) signal detection with phase-shift keying. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation and algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a nonconvexly constrained nonsmooth optimization problem involving the composition of a weakly convex function and a smooth mapping. To find a stationary point of the target problem, we propose a variable smoothing-type algorithm by combining the ideas of (i) translating the constrained problem into a Euclidean optimization problem with a smooth parametrization of the constraint set; (ii) exploiting a sequence of smoothed surrogate functions, of the cost function, given with the Moreau envelope of a weakly convex function. The proposed algorithm produces a vector sequence by the gradient descent update of a smoothed surrogate function at each iteration. In a case where the proximity operator of the weakly convex function is available, the proposed algorithm does not require any iterative solver for subproblems therein. By leveraging tools in the variational analysis, we show the so-called {\em gradient consistency property}, which is a key ingredient for smoothing-type algorithms, of the smoothed surrogate function used in this paper. Based on the gradient consistency property, we also establish an asymptotic convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>KLAP: KYP lemma based low-rank approximation for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel passivity enforcement (passivation) method, called KLAP, for linear time-invariant systems based on the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma and the closely related Lur'e equations. The passivation problem in our framework corresponds to finding a perturbation to a given non-passive system that renders the system passive while minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_2$ or frequency-weighted $\mathcal{H}_2$ distance between the original non-passive and the resulting passive system. We show that this problem can be formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem whose objective function can be differentiated efficiently even in large-scale settings. We show that any minimizer of the unconstrained problem yields the same passive system. Furthermore, we prove that, in the absence of a feedthrough term, every local minimizer is also a global minimizer. For cases involving a non-trivial feedthrough term, we analyze global minimizers in relation to the extremal solutions of the Lur'e equations, which can serve as tools for identifying local minima. To solve the resulting numerical optimization problem efficiently, we propose an initialization strategy based on modifying the feedthrough term and a restart strategy when it is likely that the optimization has converged to a local minimum. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Adapting Newton's Method to Neural Networks through a Summary of Higher-Order Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When training large models, such as neural networks, the full derivatives of order 2 and beyond are usually inaccessible, due to their computational cost. This is why, among the second-order optimization methods, it is very common to bypass the computation of the Hessian by using first-order information, such as the gradient of the parameters (e.g., quasi-Newton methods) or the activations (e.g., K-FAC). In this paper, we focus on the exact and explicit computation of projections of the Hessian and higher-order derivatives on well-chosen subspaces, which are relevant for optimization. Namely, for a given partition of the set of parameters, it is possible to compute tensors which can be seen as "higher-order derivatives according to the partition", at a reasonable cost as long as the number of subsets of the partition remains small. Then, we propose an optimization method exploiting these tensors at order 2 and 3 with several interesting properties, including: it outputs a learning rate per subset of parameters, which can be used for hyperparameter tuning; it takes into account long-range interactions between the layers of the trained neural network, which is usually not the case in similar methods (e.g., K-FAC); the trajectory of the optimization is invariant under affine layer-wise reparameterization.

      <title>Using Synthetic Data to Mitigate Unfairness and Preserve Privacy in Collaborative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In distributed computing environments, collaborative machine learning enables multiple clients to train a global model collaboratively. To preserve privacy in such settings, a common technique is to utilize frequent updates and transmissions of model parameters. However, this results in high communication costs between the clients and the server. To tackle unfairness concerns in distributed environments, client-specific information (e.g., local dataset size or data-related fairness metrics) must be sent to the server to compute algorithmic quantities (e.g., aggregation weights), which leads to a potential leakage of client information. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage strategy that promotes fair predictions, prevents client-data leakage, and reduces communication costs in certain scenarios without the need to pass information between clients and server iteratively. In the first stage, for each client, we use its local dataset to obtain a synthetic dataset by solving a bilevel optimization problem that aims to ensure that the ultimate global model yields fair predictions. In the second stage, we apply a method with differential privacy guarantees to the synthetic dataset from the first stage to obtain a second synthetic data. We then pass each client's second-stage synthetic dataset to the server, the collection of which is used to train the server model using conventional machine learning techniques (that no longer need to take fairness metrics or privacy into account). Thus, we eliminate the need to handle fairness-specific aggregation weights while preserving client privacy. Our approach requires only a single communication between the clients and the server (thus making it communication cost-effective), maintains data privacy, and promotes fairness. We present empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>On optimal LISA orbit design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ESA/NASA joint LISA (laser interferometer space antenna) mission is designed to detect gravitational waves, which relies crucially on maintaining three-spacecraft constellation as close to an equilateral triangle with a designed distance as possible. Efforts have been made to achieve this goal by using various simplified models to make it easy to approximately solve the complex problem. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem using exact nonlinear Kepler's orbit equations. It is shown that the optimal solution based on the exact nonlinear Kepler's orbit equations gives a better solution than the previously obtained ones.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis: a control perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online learning and model reference adaptive control have many interesting intersections. One area where they differ however is in how the algorithms are analyzed and what objective or metric is used to discriminate "good" algorithms from "bad" algorithms. In adaptive control there are usually two objectives: 1) prove that all time varying parameters/states of the system are bounded, and 2) that the instantaneous error between the adaptively controlled system and a reference system converges to zero over time (or at least a compact set). For online learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the regret the algorithm incurs. Regret is defined as the cumulative loss (cost) over time from the online algorithm minus the cumulative loss (cost) of the single optimal fixed parameter choice in hindsight. Another significant difference between the two areas of research is with regard to the assumptions made in order to obtain said results. Adaptive control makes assumptions about the input-output properties of the control problem and derives solutions for a fixed error model or optimization task. In the online learning literature results are derived for classes of loss functions (i.e. convex) while a priori assuming certain signals are bounded. In this work we discuss these differences in detail through the regret based analysis of gradient descent for convex functions and the control based analysis of a streaming regression problem. We close with a discussion about the newly defined paradigm of online adaptive control.</description>
