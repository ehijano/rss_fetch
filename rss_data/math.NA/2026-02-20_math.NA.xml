      <title>An entropy-stable oscillation-eliminating dgsem for the euler equations on curvilinear meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an entropy-stable high-order numerical method for the two-dimensional compressible Euler equations on general curvilinear meshes. The proposed approach is based on a nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) that satisfies the summation-by-parts (SBP) property. At the semidiscrete level, entropy stability is established through the SBP structure and the discrete metric identities associated with curvilinear coordinate mappings. By incorporating entropy-stable numerical fluxes at element interfaces, a global discrete entropy inequality is obtained. To further control nonphysical oscillations near strong discontinuities, the entropy-stable DG formulation is combined with a modified oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) method, which was originally proposed in [59]. We observe that the zero-order damping coefficient in the original OEDG method naturally serves as an effective shock indicator, which enables localization of the oscillation control mechanism and significantly reduces computational cost. Moreover, while the original OEDG formulation relies on local orthogonal modal bases and is primarily restricted to simplicial meshes, we reformulate the OE procedure using projection operators, allowing for a systematic extension to general curvilinear meshes. The resulting method preserves conservation and entropy stability while effectively suppressing spurious oscillations. A series of challenging numerical experiments is presented to demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed entropy-stable OEDG method on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes.</description>

      <title>Fast, High-Accuracy, Randomized Nullspace Computations for Tall Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop RLOBPCG, an efficient method for computing a small number of singular triplets corresponding to the smallest singular values of large, tall matrices. The algorithm combines randomized preconditioner from the sketch-and-precondition techniques with the LOBPCG eigensolver: a small sketch is used to construct a high-quality preconditioner, and LOBPCG is run on the Gram matrix to refine the singular vector. Under the standard subspace embedding assumption and a modest singular value gap between the two smallest singular values, we prove that RLOBPCG converges geometrically to the minimum singular vector. In numerical experiments, RLOBPCG achieves near-optimal accuracy on matrices with up to $10^6$ rows, outperforming classical LOBPCG and Lanczos methods by a speedup of up to $12\times$ and maintaining robustness when other iterative methods fail to converge.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition for Mean Curvature Flow of Surface Polygonal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the use of domain decomposition for potentially more efficient mean curvature flow of surface meshes, whose faces are arbitrary simple polygons. We first test traditional domain decomposition methods with and without overlap of deconstructed domains. And we present adapted Robin transmission conditions of optimized Schwarz method. We then analyze the resulting smoothing from the point of view of shape quality and texture deformation. By decomposing the initial mesh into two sub-meshes, we solve two smaller boundary value problems instead of one big problem, and we can process these two tasks almost entirely in parallel.</description>

      <title>ARCANE: Scalable high-degree cubature formulae for simulating SDEs without Monte Carlo error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo sampling is the standard approach for estimating properties of solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs), but accurate estimates require huge sample sizes. Lyons and Victoir (2004) proposed replacing independently sampled Brownian driving paths with "cubature formulae", deterministic weighted sets of paths that match Brownian "signature moments" up to some degree $D$. They prove that cubature formulae exist for arbitrary $D$, but explicit constructions are difficult and have only reached $D=7$, too small for practical use. We present ARCANE, an algorithm that efficiently and automatically constructs cubature formulae of arbitrary degree. It reproduces the state of the art in seconds and reaches $\boldsymbol{D=19}$ within hours on modest hardware. In simulations across multiple different SDEs and error metrics, our cubature formulae robustly achieve an error orders of magnitude smaller than Monte Carlo with the same number of paths.</description>

      <title>Invertibility of the Fourier Diffraction Relation in Raster Scan Diffraction Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction tomography aims to recover an object's scattering potential from measured wave fields. In the classical setting, the object is illuminated by plane waves from many directions, and the Fourier diffraction theorem gives a direct relation between the Fourier transform of the scattering potential of the object and the Fourier transformed measurements.
  In many practical imaging systems, however, focused beams are used instead of plane waves. These beams are then translated across the object to bring different regions of interest into focus. The Fourier diffraction relation adapted to this setting differs in one crucial point from the plane-wave case: while certain Fourier coefficients of the measurements still directly correspond to individual Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential, others are given by linear combinations of two Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential.
  This article investigates which Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential can be uniquely recovered from these relations. We show that in dimensions higher than two, all coefficients appearing in the equations are typically uniquely determined. In two dimensions, however, only part of the Fourier coverage is uniquely recoverable, while on the remaining subset, distinct coefficients can produce identical data.</description>

      <title>Analysis of an exponential integrator for stochastic PDEs driven by Riesz noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and study an explicit exponential integrator for parabolic SPDEs in any dimension driven by a Gaussian noise which is white in time and with spatial correlation given by a Riesz kernel. Under assumptions on the coefficients of the SPDE, we prove strong error bounds and exhibit how the rate of convergence depends on the exponent in the Riesz kernel. Finally, numerical experiments in spatial dimensions $1$ and $2$ are provided in order to confirm our convergence results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction tomography is a widely used inverse scattering technique for quantitative imaging of weakly scattering media. In its conventional formulation, diffraction tomography assumes monochromatic plane wave illumination. This assumption, however, represents a simplification that often fails to reflect practical imaging systems such as medical ultrasound, where focused beams are used to scan a region of interest of the human body. Such measurement setups, combining focused illumination with scanning, have not yet been incorporated into the diffraction tomography framework. To bridge this gap, we extend diffraction tomography by modeling incident fields as Herglotz waves, thereby incorporating focused beams into the theory. Within this setting, we derive a new Fourier diffraction relation, which forms the basis for quantitative tomographic reconstruction from scanning data. Using this result, we systematically analyze how different scan geometries influence the reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Application and Evaluation of the Common Circles Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of the common circle method for estimating sample motion in optical diffraction tomography (ODT) of sub-millimeter sized biological tissue. When samples are confined via contact-free acoustical force fields, their motion must be estimated from the captured images. The common circle method identifies intersections of Ewald spheres in Fourier space to determine rotational motion. This paper presents a practical implementation, incorporating temporal consistency constraints to achieve stable reconstructions. Our results on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that the common circle method provides a computationally efficient alternative to full optimization methods for motion detection.</description>

      <title>Functional Analysis and Parallel Domain Decomposition for the TV-Stokes Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TV-Stokes model is a two-step variational method for image denoising that combines the estimation of a divergence-free tangent field with total variation regularization in the first step and then uses that to reconstruct the image in the second step. Although effective in practice, its mathematical structure and potential for parallelization have remained unexplored. In this work, we establish a rigorous functional-analytic foundation for the TV-Stokes model. We formulate both steps in appropriate infinite-dimensional function spaces, derive their dual formulations, and analyze the compatibility and mathematical consistency of the coupled system. In particular, we identify analytical inconsistencies in the original formulation and demonstrate how an alternative model resolves them. We also examine the orthogonal projection onto the divergence-free subspace, proving its existence in a continuous setting and establishing consistency with its discrete counterpart.
  Building on this theoretical framework, we develop the first domain decomposition method for TV-Stokes by applying overlapping Schwarz-type iterations to the duals of both steps. Although the divergence-free constraint gives rise to a global projection operator in the continuous model, we show that it becomes locally computable in the discrete setting. This insight enables a fully parallelizable algorithm suitable for large-scale image processing in memory-constrained environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate the correctness of the domain decomposition approach and its usability in parallel image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>High Order semi-implicit Rosenbrock type and Multistep methods for evolutionary partial differential equations with higher order derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to apply a semi-implicit (SI) strategy within a Rosenbrock-type and IMEX linear multistep (LM) framework to a sequence of 1D time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) with high order spatial derivatives. This strategy provides great flexibility to treat these equations, and allows the construction of simple lienarly implicit schemes without any Newton iteration. Furthermore, the SI schemes so designed do not require the severe time-step restrictions typically encountered when using explicit methods for stability, i.e., $\Delta t = \mathcal{O}(\Delta x^k)$ for the $k$-th order PDEs with $k\ge 2$. For space discrertization, this strategy is combined with finite difference schemes. We provide example of methods up to order $p = 4$, and we illustrate the effectiveness of the schemes with appllications to dissipative, dispersive, and biharmonic-type equations. Numerical experiments show that the proposed schemes are stable and achieve the expected orders of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Computing the action of a matrix exponential on an interval via the $\star$-product approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for computing the action of the matrix exponential on a vector, $e^{At}v$. The proposed approach efficiently evaluates the solution for all $t$ within a prescribed bounded interval by expanding it into an orthogonal polynomial series. This method is derived from a new representation of the matrix exponential in the so-called $\star$-algebra, an algebra of bivariate distributions. The resulting formulation leads to a linear system equivalent to a matrix equation of Stein type, which can be solved by either direct or Krylov subspace methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Structured Analytic Mappings for Point Set Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic approximation model for non-rigid point set registration, grounded in the multivariate Taylor expansion of vector-valued functions. By exploiting the algebraic structure of Taylor expansions, we construct a structured function space spanned by truncated basis terms, allowing smooth deformations to be represented with low complexity and explicit form. To estimate mappings within this space, we develop a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm that progressively lifts the identity map into higher-order analytic forms. This structured framework unifies rigid, affine, and nonlinear deformations under a single closed-form formulation, without relying on kernel functions or high-dimensional parameterizations. The proposed model is embedded into a standard ICP loop -- using (by default) nearest-neighbor correspondences -- resulting in Analytic-ICP, an efficient registration algorithm with quasi-linear time complexity. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that Analytic-ICP achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than classical methods such as CPD and TPS-RPM, particularly for small and smooth deformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a relatively small perturbation on various generalized inverses functions or quantities derived from a tensor $\mathcal{A}$.When a small tensor perturbation \(\mathcal{E}\) is introduced, it becomes challenging to analyze generalized inverses of the perturbed tensor \( \mathcal{D} =\mathcal{A}+\mathcal{E}\) and to determine how this perturbation affects a generalized inverse of $\mathcal{A}$.Our main goal is to understand the relationship between $\mathcal{D}^\Game$ and \( \mathcal{A}^\Game \), where $(\cdot)^\Game$ denotes a specific generalized inverse or a class of generalized inverses.In particular, classes of tensor inner, outer, and $(\mathcal{B},\mathcal{C})$ inverses are considered.</description>

      <title>AutoNumerics: An Autonomous, PDE-Agnostic Multi-Agent Pipeline for Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Distribution of Ratios of Particle Solver-based Likelihoods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to sample posterior distribution in a Bayesian inverse problem, where the likelihood function is random. Concretely, we consider the case where one has full field observations of a PDE solution, in case a one-dimensional diffusion equation, subject to a Gaussian observation error. Assuming one uses a particle-based Monte Carlo simulation when approximating the likelihood function, one gets an approximate likelihood with additive Gaussian noise in the log-likelihood. We study how these two Gaussian distributions affect the distribution of ratios of approximate likelihood evaluations, as required when evaluating acceptance probabilities in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We do so through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Detecting when one probe vector is enough for preconditioned log-determinant approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present randomized algorithms for estimating the log-determinant of regularized symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. The algorithms access the matrix only through matrix vector products, and are based on the introduction of a preconditioner and stochastic trace estimator. We claim that preconditioning as much as we can and making a rough estimate of the residual part with a small budget achieves a small error in most of the cases. We choose a Nystr\"om preconditioner and estimate the residual using only one sample of stochastic Lanczos quadrature (SLQ). We analyze the performance of this strategy from a theoretical and practical viewpoint. We also present an algorithm that, at almost no additional cost, detects whether the proposed strategy is not the most effective, in which case it uses more samples for the SLQ part. Numerical examples on several test matrices show that our proposed methods are competitive with existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Explicit Taylor ODE Integrators with Symbolic-Numeric Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taylor series methods show a newfound promise for the solution of non-stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given the rise of new compiler-enhanced techniques for calculating high order derivatives. In this paper we detail a new Julia-based implementation that has two important techniques: (1) a general purpose higher-order automatic differentiation engine for derivative evaluation with low overhead; (2) a combined symbolic-numeric approach to generate code for recursively computing the Taylor polynomial of the ODE solution. We demonstrate that the resulting software's compiler-based tooling is transparent to the user, requiring no changes from interfaces required to use standard explicit Runge-Kutta methods, while achieving better run time performance. In addition, we also developed a comprehensive adaptive time and order algorithm that uses different step size and polynomial degree across the integration period, which makes this implementation more efficient and versatile in a broad range of dynamics. We show that for codes compatible with compiler transformations, these integrators are more efficient and robust than the traditionally used explicit Runge-Kutta methods.</description>

      <title>On the Limit of the Tridiagonal Model for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, a description of the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E random matrix is provided by Edelman and Dumitriu. The resulting tridiagonal ensemble makes sense for all $\beta&gt;0$, and has spectrum given by the $\beta$-ensemble for all $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, the tridiagonal model has useful stochastic operator limits which was introduced and analyzed in subsequent studies.
  In this work, we analogously study the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E process which has eigenvalues governed by $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion. We propose an explicit limit of the upper left $k \times k$ minor of the $n \times n$ tridiagonal process as $n \to \infty$ and $k$ remains fixed. We prove the result for $\beta=1$, and also provide numerical evidence for $\beta=1,2,4$. This leads us to conjecture the form of a dynamical $\beta$-stochastic Airy operator with smallest $k$ eigenvalues evolving according to the $n \to \infty$ limit of the largest, centered and re-scaled, $k$ eigenvalues of $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Instance-Wise Adaptive Sampling for Dataset Construction in Approximating Inverse Problem Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.</description>

      <title>Alternatives to the Laplacian for Scalable Spectral Clustering with Group Fairness Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness (balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm. Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet, Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as much balance.</description>
