      <title>A case study on the impact of interplanetary coronal mass ejection on the Martian O(1S) 557.7 nm dayglow emission using ExoMars TGO/NOMAD-UVIS observations: First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report, for the first time, the impact of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) on the recently discovered O($^1$S) 557.7 nm dayglow emission in the Martian atmosphere. Although there are only a few studies on the seasonal variation are available in the literature, the impact of ICME on 557.7 nm dayglow emission has not been investigated so far. Using the instruments aboard ExoMars-TGO and MAVEN spacecrafts, we show that the primary emission peak (75-80 km) remains unaffected during the ICME event compared to quiet-times. However, a noticeable enhancement has been observed in the brightness of secondary emission peak (110-120 km) and the upper altitude region (140-180 km). The enhancement is attributed to the increased solar electrons and X-ray fluxes, augmenting the electron-impact process and causing the enhancement in the brightness. These analyses have an implication to comprehend the role of intense solar transients like ICME on the Martian dayglow emissions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Solar Driver Forecasting with Multivariate Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a comprehensive framework for F10.7, S10.7, M10.7, and Y10.7 solar driver forecasting with a time series Transformer (PatchTST). To ensure an equal representation of high and low levels of solar activity, we construct a custom loss function to weight samples based on the distance between the solar driver's historical distribution and the training set. The solar driver forecasting framework includes an 18-day lookback window and forecasts 6 days into the future. When benchmarked against the Space Environment Technologies (SET) dataset, our model consistently produces forecasts with a lower standard mean error in nearly all cases, with improved prediction accuracy during periods of high solar activity. All the code is available on Github https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/sw-driver-forecaster.</description>

      <title>Whistler waves in the young solar wind: statistics of amplitude and propagation direction from Parker Solar Probe Encounters 1-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the interplanetary space solar wind plasma, whistler waves are observed in a wide range of heliocentric distance (from ~20 solar radii (RS) to Jupiter's orbit). They are known to interact with solar wind suprathermal electrons (strahl and halo) and to regulate the solar wind heat flux through scattering the strahl electrons. We present the results of applying the technique to determine the whistler wave propagation direction to the spectral data continuously collected by the FIELDS instruments aboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The technique was validated based on the results obtained from burst mode magnetic and electric field waveform data collected during Encounter 1. We estimated the effective length of the PSP electric field antennas (EFI) for a variety of solar wind conditions in the whistler wave frequency range and utilized these estimates for determining the whistler wave properties during PSP Encounters 1-11. Our findings show that (1) the enhancement of the whistler wave occurrence rate and wave amplitudes observed between 25-35 RS is predominantly due to the sunward propagating whistler waves population associated with the switchback-related magnetic dips; (2) the anti-sunward or counter-propagating cases are observed at 30-40 RS; (3) between 40-50 RS, sunward and anti-sunward whistlers are observed with comparable occurrence rates; and (4) almost no sunward or counter-propagating whistlers were observed at heliocentric distances above 50 RS.</description>
