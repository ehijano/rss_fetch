      <title>Efficient Calibration in the rough Bergomi model by Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the empirical success in modeling volatility of the rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model, it suffers from pricing and calibration difficulties stemming from its non-Markovian structure. To address this, we propose a comprehensive computational framework that enhances both simulation and calibration. First, we develop a modified Sum-of-Exponentials (mSOE) Monte Carlo scheme which hybridizes an exact simulation of the singular kernel near the origin with a multi-factor approximation for the remainder. This method achieves high accuracy, particularly for out-of-the-money options, with an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ computational cost. Second, based on this efficient pricing engine, we then propose a distribution-matching calibration scheme by using Wasserstein distance as the optimization objective. This leverages a minimax formulation against Lipschitz payoffs, which effectively distributes pricing errors and improving robustness. Our numerical results confirm the mSOE scheme's convergence and demonstrate that the calibration algorithm reliably identifies model parameters and generalizes well to path-dependent options, which offers a powerful and generic tool for practical model fitting.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Architecture for Options Wheel Strategy Decisions: LLM-Generated Bayesian Networks for Transparent Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context and qualitative nuances but struggle with the rigorous and transparent reasoning required in high-stakes quantitative domains such as financial trading. We propose a model-first hybrid architecture for the options "wheel" strategy that combines the strengths of LLMs with the robustness of a Bayesian Network. Rather than using the LLM as a black-box decision-maker, we employ it as an intelligent model builder. For each trade decision, the LLM constructs a context-specific Bayesian network by interpreting current market conditions, including prices, volatility, trends, and news, and hypothesizing relationships among key variables. The LLM also selects relevant historical data from an 18.75-year, 8,919-trade dataset to populate the network's conditional probability tables. This selection focuses on scenarios analogous to the present context. The instantiated Bayesian network then performs transparent probabilistic inference, producing explicit probability distributions and risk metrics to support decision-making. A feedback loop enables the LLM to analyze trade outcomes and iteratively refine subsequent network structures and data selection, learning from both successes and failures. Empirically, our hybrid system demonstrates effective performance on the wheel strategy. Over nearly 19 years of out-of-sample testing, it achieves a 15.3% annualized return with significantly superior risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio 1.08 versus 0.62 for market benchmarks) and dramatically lower drawdown (-8.2% versus -60%) while maintaining a 0% assignment rate through strategic option rolling. Crucially, each trade decision is fully explainable, involving on average 27 recorded decision factors (e.g., volatility level, option premium, risk indicators, market context).</description>

      <title>DeFi TrustBoost: Blockchain and AI for Trustworthy Decentralized Financial Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) TrustBoost Framework, which combines blockchain technology and Explainable AI to address challenges faced by lenders underwriting small business loan applications from low-wealth households. The framework is designed with a strong emphasis on fulfilling four crucial requirements of blockchain and AI systems: confidentiality, compliance with data protection laws, resistance to adversarial attacks, and compliance with regulatory audits. It presents a technique for tamper-proof auditing of automated AI decisions and a strategy for on-chain (inside-blockchain) and off-chain data storage to facilitate collaboration within and across financial organizations.</description>

      <title>Financial Text Classification Based On rLoRA Finetuning On Qwen3-8B model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial text classification has increasingly become an important aspect in quantitative trading systems and related tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis and the classification of financial news. In this paper, we assess the performance of the large language model Qwen3-8B on both tasks. Qwen3-8B is a state-of-the-art model that exhibits strong instruction-following and multilingual capabilities, and is distinct from standard models, primarily because it is specifically optimized for efficient fine tuning and high performance on reasoning-based benchmarks, making it suitable for financial applications. To adapt this model, we apply Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning and based on our previous work, this method increases robustness by injecting controlled noise into the embedding layers during supervised adaptation. We improve efficiency further with Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation low-rank optimization approach, and FlashAttention, which allow for faster training with lower GPU memory. For both tasks, we benchmark Qwen3-8B against standard classical transformer models, such as T5, BERT, and RoBERTa, and large models at scale, such as LLaMA1-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and Baichuan2-7B. The findings reveal that Qwen3-8B consistently surpasses these baselines by obtaining better classification accuracy and needing fewer training epochs. The synergy of instruction-based fine-tuning and memory-efficient optimization methods suggests Qwen3-8B can potentially serve as a scalable, economical option for real-time financial NLP applications. Qwen3-8B provides a very promising base for advancing dynamic quantitative trading systems in the future.</description>

      <title>The Martingale Sinkhorn Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13797v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for the martingale analogue of the Benamou-Brenier optimal transport problem, which seeks a martingale interpolating two prescribed marginals which is closest to the Brownian motion. Recent contributions have established existence and uniqueness for the optimal martingale under finite second moment assumptions on the marginals, but numerical methods exist only in the one-dimensional setting. We introduce an iterative scheme, a martingale analogue of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm, and prove its convergence in arbitrary dimension under minimal assumptions. In particular, we show that convergence holds when the marginals have finite moments of order $p &gt; 1$, thereby extending the known theory beyond the finite-second-moment regime. The proof relies on a strict descent property for the dual value of the martingale Benamou--Brenier problem. While the descent property admits a direct verification in the case of compactly supported marginals, obtaining uniform control on the iterates without assuming compact support is substantially more delicate and constitutes the main technical challenge.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multilevel Splitting: First Application to Rare-Event Derivative Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the computational burden of pricing binary options in rare event regimes and introduces an adaptation of the adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) method for financial derivatives. Standard Monte Carlo becomes inefficient for deep out-of-the-money binaries due to discontinuous payoffs and extremely small exercise probabilities, requiring prohibitively large sample sizes for accurate estimation. The proposed AMS framework reformulates the rare-event problem as a sequence of conditional events and is applied under both Black-Scholes and Heston dynamics. Numerical experiments cover European, Asian, and up-and-in barrier digital options, together with a multidimensional digital payoff designed as a stress test. Across all contracts, AMS achieves substantial gains, reaching up to 200-fold improvements over standard Monte Carlo, while preserving unbiasedness and showing robust performance with respect to the choice of importance function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of AMS to derivative pricing. An open-source Rcpp implementation is provided, supporting multiple discretisation schemes and alternative importance functions.</description>
