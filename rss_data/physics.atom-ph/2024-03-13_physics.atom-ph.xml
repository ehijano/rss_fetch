      <title>Noninteger high-harmonic generation from extended correlated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectra produced by high-harmonic generation (HHG) typically exhibit well-defined peaks at odd integers times the laser frequency. However, in recent investigations of HHG from correlated materials, spectra exhibit signals at noninteger harmonics which do not conform to the well-known symmetry-based selection rules for HHG-spectra. Here, we use the Fermi-Hubbard model to study HHG from a linear chain of atoms. This model allows us to study both the correlated and uncorrelated phases through a specification of the amount of onsite electron-electron repulsion. The presence of signal at noninteger harmonics can be interpreted as originating from the population of multiple Floquet states. We show how this coupling to different Floquet states depends on the characteristics of the driving pulse and the strength of the electron-electron interaction in the system.</description>

      <title>Multi-axis inertial sensing with 2D arrays of Bose Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are an exquisite measurement tool for inertial forces. However, they are commonly limited to one single sensitive axis, allowing high-precision multi-dimensional sensing only through subsequent or postcorrected measurements. Here, we introduce a novel 2D-array-arrangement of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) initialized utilizing time-averaged optical potentials for simultaneous multi-axis inertial sensing. Deploying a 3 x 3 BEC array covering 1.6 mm^2, we perform measurements of angular velocity and acceleration of a rotating reference mirror, as well as a linear acceleration, e.g., induced by gravity, gradients, and higher order derivatives. We anticipate increased sensitivity of our method in interferometers with large scale factors in long-baseline or satellite atom interferometry. Our work paves the way for simple high-precision multi-axis inertial sensing and we envision further applications, e.g., for three-dimensional wave front characterization.</description>

      <title>A continuous beam monochromator for matter waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom and, of late, molecule interferometers find application in both the crucible of fundamental research and industrial pursuits. A prevalent methodology in the construction of atom interferometers involves the utilisation of gratings fashioned from laser beams. While this approach imparts commendable precision, it is hampered by its incapacity to attain exceedingly short wavelengths and its dependence on intricate laser systems for operational efficacy. All applications require the control of matter waves, particularly the particle's velocity. In this manuscript, we propose a continuous beam monochromator scheme reaching enormously high velocity purification with speed ratios in the order of $10^3$ based on atom-surface diffraction. Beyond these high purifications, the proposed scheme simplifies the application by reducing the degree of freedom to a single angle, selecting the wanted particle's velocity.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-free measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions: General measurement protocol and Rydberg atom implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a protocol that gives access to out-of-time-ordered correlation functions in many-body quantum systems. Unlike other such protocols, our proposal, which can be applied to arbitrary initial states, neither requires ancilla degrees of freedom to the quantum system of interest, nor has the need for randomized measurements. Nontrivial experimental capabilities required to implement the protocol are single-site measurements, single-site rotations, and backwards time evolution. To exemplify the implementation of the protocol, we put forward a strategy for Hamiltonian sign inversion $H\to-H$ in arrays of Rydberg-dressed atoms. In this way, a complete and practical toolbox is obtained for the measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlations in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.</description>

      <title>Quantum jump photodetector for narrowband photon counting with a single atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a single neutral \textsuperscript{87}Rb atom held in an optical trap, and "quantum jump" detection of single-photon-initiated state changes, we demonstrate an intrinsically-narrowband single-photon detector, of interest for separating weak signals from strong optical background. Using novel statistical analysis, we measure quantum efficiency of \SI{2.9+-0.2e-3}{}, a record for single-pass quantum jump production, and dark counts of \SI{9+-20e-3}{counts\per\second} during passive accumulation plus \SI{1.8+-0.1e-2}{counts} per readout, orders of magnitude below those of traditional single-photon detectors. The \SI{6}{\mega\hertz} detection bandwidth is orders of magnitude narrower than existing atomic filters. Available methods can substantially improve \QJPDAcronym{} quantum efficiency, dark counts, bandwidth, and tunability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic laser ablation loading of a linear Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed method for accumulating Ca$^{+}$ ions controllably in a linear Paul trap. The ions are generated by pulsed laser ablation and dynamically loaded into the ion trap by switching the trapping potential on and off. The loaded ions are precooled by buffer gas and then laser-cooled to form Coulomb crystals for verifying quantity. The number of ions is controlled by manipulating the trapping potential of the ion trap, partial pressure of buffer gas and turn-on time of the entrance end cap voltage. With single-pulse laser ablation, the number of trapped ions ranges from tens to ten thousand. The kinetic energy of loaded ions can be selected via the optimal turn-on time of the entrance end cap. Using multiple-pulse laser ablation, the number is further increased and reaches about $4 \times 10^{4}$. The dynamic loading method has wide application for accumulating low-yielding ions via laser ablation in the ion trap.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of the Fine-Structure Qubit in a Single Alkaline-Earth Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the first realization of a novel neutral atom qubit encoded in the metastable fine-structure states ${^3\rm{P}_0}$ and ${^3\rm{P}_2}$ of single $^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in an optical tweezer. Raman coupling of the qubit states promises rapid single-qubit rotations on par with the fast Rydberg-mediated two-body gates. We demonstrate preparation, read-out, and coherent control of the qubit. In addition to driving Rabi oscillations bridging an energy gap of more than 17 THz using a pair of phase-locked clock lasers, we also carry out Ramsey spectroscopy to extract the transverse qubit coherence time $T_2$. When the tweezer is tuned into magic trapping conditions, which is achieved in our setup by tuning the tensor polarizability of the ${^3\rm{P}_2}$ state via an external control magnetic field, we measure $T_2 = 1.2$ ms. A microscopic quantum mechanical model is used to simulate our experiments including dominant noise sources. We identify the main constraints limiting the observed coherence time and project improvements to our system in the immediate future. Our work opens the door for a so far unexplored qubit encoding concept for neutral atom based quantum computing.</description>
