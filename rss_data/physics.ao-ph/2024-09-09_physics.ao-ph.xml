      <title>Targeted calibration to adjust stability biases in non-differentiable complex system models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical models of complex systems like the Earth system are expensive to run and involve many uncertain and typically hand-tuned parameters. In the context of anthropogenic climate change, there is particular concern that specific tipping elements, like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, might be overly stable in models due to imperfect parameter choices. However, estimates of the critical forcing thresholds are highly uncertain because the parameter spaces can practically not be explored. Here, we introduce a method for efficient, systematic, and objective calibration of process-based models. Our method drives the system toward parameter configurations where it loses or gains stability, and scales much more efficiently than a brute force approach. We successfully apply the method to a simple bistable model and a conceptual but physically plausible model of the global ocean circulation, demonstrating that our method can help find hidden tipping points, and can calibrate complex models under user-defined constraints.</description>

      <title>An OpenMetBuoy dataset of Marginal Ice Zone dynamics collected around Svalbard in 2022 and 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea ice is a key element of the global Earth system, with a major impact on global climate and regional weather. Unfortunately, accurate sea ice modeling is challenging due to the diversity and complexity of underlying physics happening there, and a relative lack of ground truth observations. This is especially true for the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), which is the area where sea ice is affected by incoming ocean waves. Waves contribute to making the area dynamic, and due to the low survival time of the buoys deployed there, the MIZ is challenging to monitor. In 2022-2023, we released 79 OpenMetBuoys (OMBs) around Svalbard, both in the MIZ and the ocean immediately outside of it. OMBs are affordable enough to be deployed in large number, and gather information about drift (GPS position) and waves (1-dimensional elevation spectrum). This provides data focusing on the area around Svalbard with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. We expect that this will allow to perform validation and calibration of ice models and remote sensing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of keeping Mars warm with nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-third of Mars' surface has shallow-buried H$_2$O, but it is currently too cold for use by life. Proposals to warm Mars using greenhouse gases require a large mass of ingredients that are rare on Mars' surface. However, we show here that artificial aerosols made from materials that are readily available at Mars-for example, conductive nanorods that are ~9 $\mu$m long-could warm Mars &gt;5 $\times$ 10$^3$ times more effectively than the best gases. Such nanoparticles forward-scatter sunlight and efficiently block upwelling thermal infrared. Similar to the natural dust of Mars, they are swept high into Mars' atmosphere, allowing delivery from the near-surface. For a particle lifetime of 10 years, two climate models indicate that sustained release at 30 liters/sec would globally warm Mars by $\gtrsim$30 K and start to melt the ice. Therefore, if nanoparticles can be made at scale on (or delivered to) Mars, then the barrier to warming of Mars appears to not be as high as previously thought.</description>
