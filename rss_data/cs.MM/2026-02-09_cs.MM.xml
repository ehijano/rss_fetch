      <title>Analyzing Diffusion and Autoregressive Vision Language Models in Multimodal Embedding Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding models are a fundamental component of modern AI systems such as semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation. Recent advances in large foundation models have substantially accelerated the development of embedding models, including those based on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), and Multimodal LLMs. More recently, Large Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Multimodal dLLMs have emerged as competitive alternatives to autoregressive models, offering advantages such as bidirectional attention and parallel generation. This progress naturally raises a critical yet unexplored question: can Multimodal dLLMs serve as effective multimodal embedding models? To answer this, we present the first systematic study of converting Multimodal dLLMs into embedding models. We evaluate state-of-the-art Multimodal dLLMs and Autoregressive VLMs across three categories of embedding tasks: classification, visual question answering, and information retrieval. Our results show that Multimodal dLLM embeddings generally underperform their autoregressive VLM counterparts. The stronger diffusion-based model, LaViDa, lags by only 3.5 points on classification, 2.5 points on VQA, and 4.4 points on retrieval tasks, whereas the other diffusion-based model, MMaDA, exhibits substantially larger performance gaps, exceeding 20 points across all tasks. Further analysis reveals insufficient image-text alignment in diffusion-based models, accounting for the observed limitations in their embedding performance.</description>

      <title>UAV-Mounted Aerial Relays in Military Communications: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relays are pivotal in military communication networks, expanding coverage and ensuring reliable connectivity in challenging operational environments. While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resolution and Chroma Subsampling for Energy-Efficient Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional video encoders typically employ a fixed chroma subsampling format, such as YUV420, which may not optimally reflect variations in chroma detail across different types of content. This can lead to suboptimal chroma quality and inefficiencies in bitrate allocation. We propose an Adaptive Resolution-Chroma Subsampling (ARCS) framework that jointly optimizes spatial resolution and chroma subsampling to balance perceptual quality and decoding efficiency. ARCS selects an optimal (resolution, chroma format) pair for each bitrate by maximizing a composite quality-complexity objective, while enforcing monotonicity constraints to ensure smooth transitions between representations. Experimental results using x265 show that, compared to a fixed-format encoding (YUV444), on average, ARCS achieves a 13.48 % bitrate savings and a 62.18 % reduction in decoding time, which we use as a proxy for the decoding energy, to yield the same colorVideoVDP score. The proposed framework introduces chroma adaptivity as a new control dimension for energy-efficient video streaming.</description>

      <title>ALIEN: Analytic Latent Watermarking for Controllable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking is a technical alternative to safeguarding intellectual property and reducing misuse. Existing methods focus on optimizing watermarked latent variables to balance watermark robustness and fidelity, as Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are considered a powerful tool for generative tasks. However, reliance on computationally intensive heuristic optimization for iterative signal refinement results in high training overhead and local optima entrapment.To address these issues, we propose an \underline{A}na\underline{l}ytical Watermark\underline{i}ng Framework for Controllabl\underline{e} Generatio\underline{n} (ALIEN). We develop the first analytical derivation of the time-dependent modulation coefficient that guides the diffusion of watermark residuals to achieve controllable watermark embedding pattern.Experimental results show that ALIEN-Q outperforms the state-of-the-art by 33.1\% across 5 quality metrics, and ALIEN-R demonstrates 14.0\% improved robustness against generative variant and stability threats compared to the state-of-the-art across 15 distinct conditions.

      <title>Content-Driven Frame-Level Bit Prediction for Rate Control in Versatile Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate control allocates bits efficiently across frames to meet a target bitrate while maintaining quality. Conventional two-pass rate control (2pRC) in Versatile Video Coding (VVC) relies on analytical rate-QP models, which often fail to capture nonlinear spatial-temporal variations, causing quality instability and high complexity due to multiple trial encodes. This paper proposes a content-adaptive framework that predicts frame-level bit consumption using lightweight features from the Video Complexity Analyzer (VCA) and quantization parameters within a Random Forest regression. On ultra-high-definition sequences encoded with VVenC, the model achieves strong correlation with ground truth, yielding R2 values of 0.93, 0.88, and 0.77 for I-, P-, and B-frames, respectively. Integrated into a rate-control loop, it achieves comparable coding efficiency to 2pRC while reducing total encoding time by 33.3%. The results show that VCA-driven bit prediction provides a computationally efficient and accurate alternative to conventional rate-QP models.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Multi-Condition DiTs: Eliminating Redundant Attention via Position-Alignment and Keyword-Scoping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While modern text-to-image models excel at prompt-based generation, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary for specific user requirements like spatial layouts or subject appearances. Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.</description>

      <title>Visual Autoregressive Modeling for Instruction-Guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer. VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and efficiency. On EMU-Edit and PIE-Bench benchmarks, VAREdit outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by a substantial margin in terms of both CLIP and GPT scores. Moreover, VAREdit completes a 512$\times$512 editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the similarly sized UltraEdit.
