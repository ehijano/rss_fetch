      <title>Bayesian Deep Learning for Convective Initiation Nowcasting Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluated the probability and uncertainty forecasts of five recently proposed Bayesian deep learning methods relative to a deterministic residual neural network (ResNet) baseline for 0-1 h convective initiation (CI) nowcasting using GOES-16 satellite infrared observations. Uncertainty was assessed by how well probabilistic forecasts were calibrated and how well uncertainty separated forecasts with large and small errors. Most of the Bayesian deep learning methods produced probabilistic forecasts that outperformed the deterministic ResNet, with one, the initial-weights ensemble + Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, an ensemble of deterministic ResNets with different initial weights to start training and dropout activated during inference, producing the most skillful and well-calibrated forecasts. The initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout benefited from generating multiple solutions that more thoroughly sampled the hypothesis space. The Bayesian ResNet ensemble was the only one that performed worse than the deterministic ResNet at longer lead times, likely due to the challenge of optimizing a larger number of parameters. To address this issue, the Bayesian-MOPED (MOdel Priors with Empirical Bayes using Deep neural network) ResNet ensemble was adopted, and it enhanced forecast skill by constraining the hypothesis search near the deterministic ResNet hypothesis. All Bayesian methods demonstrated well-calibrated uncertainty and effectively separated cases with large and small errors. In case studies, the initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout demonstrated better forecast skill than the Bayesian-MOPED ensemble and the deterministic ResNet on selected CI events in clear-sky regions. However, the initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout exhibited poorer generalization in clear-sky and anvil cloud regions without CI occurrence compared to the deterministic ResNet and Bayesian-MOPED ensemble.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency atmospheric water harvesting enabled by ultrasonic extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric water harvesting technology, which extracts moisture from ambient air to generate water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. However, the prohibitively high energy consumption of heat-induced evaporation process of water extraction hinders the technology deployment. Here we demonstrate that vibrational mechanical actuation can be used instead of heat to extract water from moisture harvesting materials, offering about forty-five-fold increase in the extraction energy efficiency. We report the energy consumption for water extraction below the enthalpy of water evaporation, thus breaking the thermal limit of the energy efficiency inherent to the state-of-the-art thermal evaporation and making atmospheric water harvesting technology economically feasible for adoption on scale.</description>

      <title>Forecast error diagnostics in neural weather models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep-learning (DL) weather prediction models offer some notable advantages over traditional physics-based models, including auto-differentiability and low computational cost, enabling detailed diagnostics of forecast errors. Using our convolutional encoder-decoder model, ConvCastNet, we systematically relax selected subdomains of the forecast fields towards "true" weather states (ERA5 reanalyses) and monitor the forecast skill gain in other regions. Our results show that a medium-range mid-latitude forecast improves substantially when the stratosphere and boundary layer are relaxed, while relaxation of the tropical atmosphere has a negligible effect. This underscores the need for a more accurate representation of the stratosphere and the planetary boundary layer to improve medium-range weather predictability. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between the forecast error sensitivity to initial conditions and relaxation experiments. By utilising auto-differentiability, we identify overlapping regions of large error sensitivity and strong forecast skill improvement from relaxation. Average mid-latitude error sensitivity to initial conditions shows negligible influence from the tropics, corroborating the results of the tropical relaxation experiments. The error sensitivity shows a physically consistent influence of upstream weather dynamics and sea surface temperatures on forecast accuracy. The latter also highlights the importance of accurately representing the atmosphere--ocean coupling in numerical weather prediction models. This combined approach could provide valuable heuristics for diagnosing neural model errors and guiding targeted model improvements.</description>

      <title>Using Generative Artificial Intelligence Creatively in the Classroom and Research: Examples and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although generative artificial intelligence (AI) is not new, recent technological breakthroughs have transformed its capabilities across many domains. These changes necessitate new attention from educators and specialized training within the atmospheric and related sciences. Enabling students to use generative AI effectively, responsibly, and ethically is crucial for their academic and professional development. Educators can also use generative AI to develop engaging classroom activities, such as active learning modules and games; however, they must be aware of potential pitfalls and biases. There are also ethical implications in using tools that lack transparency and have a considerable carbon footprint, as well as equity concerns for students who lack access to more sophisticated paid versions of generative AI tools and have deficiencies in prior educational training. This article is written for students and educators alike, particularly those interested in learning more about generative AI in education and research, including its use cases, ethical concerns, and a brief history of its emergence. Sample user prompts are also provided across numerous applications in education and the atmospheric and related sciences. Current solutions addressing broader ethical concerns regarding the use of generative AI in education remain limited; however, this work aims to foster a discussion that could galvanize the education community around shared goals and values.</description>
