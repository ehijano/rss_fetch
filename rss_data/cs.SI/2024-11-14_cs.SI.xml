      <title>What Are The Risks of Living in a GenAI Synthetic Reality? The Generative AI Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) technologies possess unprecedented potential to reshape our world and our perception of reality. These technologies can amplify traditionally human-centered capabilities, such as creativity and complex problem-solving in socio-technical contexts. By fostering human-AI collaboration, GenAI could enhance productivity, dismantle communication barriers across abilities and cultures, and drive innovation on a global scale. Yet, experts and the public are deeply divided on the implications of GenAI. Concerns range from issues like copyright infringement and the rights of creators whose work trains these models without explicit consent, to the conditions of those employed to annotate vast datasets. Accordingly, new laws and regulatory frameworks are emerging to address these unique challenges. Others point to broader issues, such as economic disruptions from automation and the potential impact on labor markets. Although history suggests that society can adapt to such technological upheavals, the scale and complexity of GenAI's impact warrant careful scrutiny. This paper, however, highlights a subtler, yet potentially more perilous risk of GenAI: the creation of $\textit{personalized synthetic realities}$. GenAI could enable individuals to experience a reality customized to personal desires or shaped by external influences, effectively creating a "filtered" worldview unique to each person. Such personalized synthetic realities could distort how people perceive and interact with the world, leading to a fragmented understanding of shared truths. This paper seeks to raise awareness about these profound and multifaceted risks, emphasizing the potential of GenAI to fundamentally alter the very fabric of our collective reality.</description>

      <title>Random Walk with Memory on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.08222v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random walk on complex networks with transition probabilities which depend on the current and previously visited nodes. By using an absorbing Markov chain we derive an exact expression for the mean first passage time between pairs of nodes, for a random walk with a memory of one step. We have analyzed one particular model of random walk, where the transition probabilities depend on the number of paths to the second neighbors. The numerical experiments on paradigmatic complex networks verify the validity of the theoretical expressions, and also indicate that the flattening of the stationary occupation probability accompanies a nearly optimal random search.</description>

      <title>Network-based diversification of stock and cryptocurrency portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining a balance between returns and volatility is a common strategy for portfolio diversification, whether investing in traditional equities or digital assets like cryptocurrencies. One approach for diversification is the application of community detection or clustering, using a network representing the relationships between assets. We examine two network representations, one based on a standard distance matrix based on correlation, and another based on mutual information. The Louvain and Affinity propagation algorithms were employed for finding the network communities (clusters) based on annual data. Furthermore, we examine building assets' co-occurrence networks, where communities are detected for each month throughout a whole year and then the links represent how often assets belong to the same community. Portfolios are then constructed by selecting several assets from each community based on local properties (degree centrality), global properties (closeness centrality), or explained variance (Principal component analysis), with three value ranges (max, med, min), calculated on a maximal spanning tree or a fully connected community sub-graph. We explored these various strategies on data from the S\&amp;P 500 and the Top 203 cryptocurrencies with a market cap above 2M USD in the period from Jan 2019 to Sep 2022. Moreover, we study into more details the periods of the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak and the start of the war in Ukraine. The results confirm some of the previous findings already known for traditional stock markets and provide some further insights, while they reveal an opposing trend in the crypto-assets market.</description>

      <title>Mobility-based Traffic Forecasting in a Multimodal Transport System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the analysis of all the movements of the population on the basis of their mobility from one node to another, to observe, measure, and predict the impact of traffic according to this mobility. The frequency of congestion on roads directly or indirectly impacts our economic or social welfare. Our work focuses on exploring some machine learning methods to predict (with a certain probability) traffic in a multimodal transportation network from population mobility data. We analyze the observation of the influence of people's movements on the transportation network and make a likely prediction of congestion on the network based on this observation (historical basis).</description>

      <title>A Conjecture on Group Decision Accuracy in Voter Networks through the Regularized Incomplete Beta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a conjecture on the regularized incomplete beta function in the context of majority decision systems modeled through a voter framework. We examine a network where voters interact, with some voters fixed in their decisions while others are free to change their states based on the influence of their neighbors. We demonstrate that as the number of free voters increases, the probability of selecting the correct majority outcome converges to $1-I_{0.5}(\alpha,\beta)$, where $I_{0.5}(\alpha,\beta)$ is the regularized incomplete beta function. The conjecture posits that when $\alpha &gt; \beta$, $1-I_{0.5}(\alpha,\beta) &gt; \alpha/(\alpha+\beta)$, meaning the group's decision accuracy exceeds that of an individual voter. We provide partial results, including a proof for integer values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and support the general case using a probability bound. This work extends Condorcet's Jury Theorem by incorporating voter dependence driven by network dynamics, showing that group decision accuracy can exceed individual accuracy under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Mixture Models Based Augmentation Enhances GNN Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in tasks like node and graph classification, but they often struggle to generalize, particularly to unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) data. These challenges are exacerbated when training data is limited in size or diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a theoretical framework using Rademacher complexity to compute a regret bound on the generalization error and then characterize the effect of data augmentation. This framework informs the design of GMM-GDA, an efficient graph data augmentation (GDA) algorithm leveraging the capability of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to approximate any distribution. Our approach not only outperforms existing augmentation techniques in terms of generalization but also offers improved time complexity, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>An Edge-Based Decomposition Framework for Temporal Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A temporal network is a dynamic graph where every edge is assigned an integer time label that indicates at which discrete time step the edge is available. We consider the problem of hierarchically decomposing the network and introduce an edge-based decomposition framework that unifies the core and truss decompositions for temporal networks while allowing us to consider the network's temporal dimension. Based on our new framework, we introduce the $(k,\Delta)$-core and $(k,\Delta)$-truss decompositions, which are generalizations of the classic $k$-core and $k$-truss decompositions for multigraphs. Moreover, we show how $(k,\Delta)$-cores and $(k,\Delta)$-trusses can be efficiently further decomposed to obtain spatially and temporally connected components. We evaluate the characteristics of our new decompositions and the efficiency of our algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate how our $(k,\Delta)$-decompositions can be applied to analyze malicious content in a Twitter network to obtain insights that state-of-the-art baselines cannot obtain.</description>

      <title>Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context where social media is increasingly becoming a significant platform for social movements and the formation of public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of great importance for understanding social phenomena, policy making, and guiding public opinion. However, existing simulation methods face challenges in capturing the complexity and dynamics of user behavior. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative simulation method for the dynamics of social media user opinions, the FDE-LLM algorithm, which incorporates opinion dynamics and epidemic model. This effectively constrains the actions and opinion evolution process of large language models (LLM), making them more aligned with the real cyber world. In particular, the FDE-LLM categorizes users into opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders are based on LLM role-playing and are constrained by the CA model, while opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the SIR model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Experiments were conducted on four real Weibo datasets and validated using the open-source model ChatGLM. The results show that, compared to traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) opinion dynamics algorithms and LLM-based opinion diffusion algorithms, our FDE-LLM algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and interpretability.</description>

      <title>China and the U.S. produce more impactful AI research when collaborating together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a disruptive technology, promising to grant a significant economic and strategic advantage to nations that harness its power. China, with its recent push towards AI adoption, is challenging the U.S.'s position as the global leader in this field. Given AI's massive potential, as well as the fierce geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S., several recent policies have been put in place to discourage AI scientists from migrating to, or collaborating with, the other nation. Nevertheless, the extent of talent migration and cross-border collaboration are not fully understood. Here, we analyze a dataset of over 350,000 AI scientists and 5,000,000 AI papers. We find that since 2000, China and the U.S. have led the field in terms of impact, novelty, productivity, and workforce. Most AI scientists who move to China come from the U.S., and most who move to the U.S. come from China, highlighting a notable bidirectional talent migration. Moreover, the vast majority of those moving in either direction have Asian ancestry. Upon moving, those scientists continue to collaborate frequently with those in the origin country. Although the number of collaborations between the two countries has increased since the dawn of the millennium, such collaborations continue to be relatively rare. A matching experiment reveals that the two countries have always been more impactful when collaborating than when each works without the other. These findings suggest that instead of suppressing cross-border migration and collaboration between the two nations, the science could benefit from promoting such activities.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Opinion Formation on Networks with Linear Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider public health officials aiming to spread awareness about a new vaccine in a community interconnected by a social network. How can they distribute information with minimal resources, so as to avoid polarization and ensure community-wide convergence of opinion? To tackle such challenges, we initiate the study of sample complexity of opinion convergence in networks. Our framework is built on the recognized opinion formation game, where we regard the opinion of each agent as a data-derived model, unlike previous works that treat opinions as data-independent scalars. The opinion model for every agent is initially learned from its local samples and evolves game-theoretically as all agents communicate with neighbors and revise their models towards an equilibrium. Our focus is on the sample complexity needed to ensure that the opinions converge to an equilibrium such that the final model of every agent has low generalization error.
  Our paper has two main technical results. First, we present a novel polynomial time optimization framework to quantify the total sample complexity for arbitrary networks, when the underlying learning problem is (generalized) linear regression. Second, we leverage this optimization to study the network gain which measures the improvement of sample complexity when learning over a network compared to that in isolation. Towards this end, we derive network gain bounds for various network classes including cliques, star graphs, and random regular graphs. Additionally, our framework provides a method to study sample distribution within the network, suggesting that it is sufficient to allocate samples inversely to the degree. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world networks strongly support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Non-Submodularity: Constant Approximation for Network Immunization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a network with an ongoing epidemic, the network immunization problem seeks to identify a fixed number of nodes to immunize in order to maximize the number of infections prevented. One of the fundamental computational challenges in network immunization is that the objective function is generally neither submodular nor supermodular. As a result, no efficient algorithm is known to consistently find a solution with a constant approximation guarantee. Traditionally, this problem is addressed using proxy objectives, which offer better approximation properties. However, converting to these indirect optimizations often introduces losses in effectiveness. In this paper, we overcome these fundamental barriers by utilizing the underlying stochastic structures of the diffusion process. Similar to the traditional influence objective, the immunization objective is an expectation that can be expressed as the sum of objectives over deterministic instances. However, unlike the former, some of these terms are not submodular. The key step is proving that this sum has a bounded deviation from submodularity, thereby enabling the greedy algorithm to achieve constant factor approximation. We show that this approximation still stands considering a variety of immunization settings and spread models.</description>
