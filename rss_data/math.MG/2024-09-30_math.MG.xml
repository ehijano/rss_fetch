      <title>The growth rate of surface area measure for noncompact convex sets with prescribed asymptotic cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem for a class of unbounded closed convex sets is considered. This is equivalent to a Monge-Amp\`ere equation on a bounded convex open domain with possibly non-integrable given data. A complete solution (necessary and sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness) in dimension 2 is presented. In higher dimensions, partial results are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Generalized angle vectors, geometric lattices, and flag-angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.00956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interior and exterior angle vectors of polytopes capture curvature information at faces of all dimensions and can be seen as metric variants of $f$-vectors. In this context, Gram's relation takes the place of the Euler--Poincar\'e relation as the unique linear relation among interior angles. We show the existence and uniqueness of Euler--Poincar\'e-type relations for generalized angle vectors by building a bridge to the algebraic combinatorics of geometric lattices, generalizing work of Klivans--Swartz.
  We introduce flag-angles of polytopes as a geometric counterpart to flag-$f$-vectors. Flag-angles generalize the angle deficiencies of Descartes--Shephard, Grassmann angles, and spherical intrinsic volumes. Using the machinery of incidence algebras, we relate flag-angles of zonotopes to flag-$f$-vectors of graded posets. This allows us to determine the linear relations satisfied by interior/exterior flag-angle vectors.</description>

      <title>Metric ultraproducts of groups -- simplicity, perfectness and torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.03394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the simplicity of metric ultraproducts of a family of metric groups. We also present several new examples of simple groups, such as metric ultraproducts of finite and infinite symmetric groups, linear groups, and interval exchange transformation groups. Using similar methods, we also examine concepts such as genericity, perfectness, and torsion.</description>

      <title>SIC-POVMs and orders of real quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of counting and classifying symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SICs or SIC-POVMs), that is, sets of $d^2$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$. For $4 \leq d \leq 90$, we show the number of known equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs in dimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of (not necessarily invertible) ideal classes in the real quadratic order of discriminant $(d+1)(d-3)$. Equivalently, this is the number of $\mathbf{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ conjugacy classes in $\mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of trace $d-1$. We conjecture the equality extends to all $d \geq 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies more that one equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs for every $d &gt; 22$.
  We refine the "class field hypothesis" of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SIC. The class fields conjecturally associated to SICs in dimension $d$ have a natural partial order under inclusion; we show the natural inclusions of these fields in the partial order are strict, except in a small family of cases.</description>

      <title>The Star Geometry of Critic-Based Regularizer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational regularization is a classical technique to solve statistical inference tasks and inverse problems, with modern data-driven approaches parameterizing regularizers via deep neural networks showcasing impressive empirical performance. Recent works along these lines learn task-dependent regularizers. This is done by integrating information about the measurements and ground-truth data in an unsupervised, critic-based loss function, where the regularizer attributes low values to likely data and high values to unlikely data. However, there is little theory about the structure of regularizers learned via this process and how it relates to the two data distributions. To make progress on this challenge, we initiate a study of optimizing critic-based loss functions to learn regularizers over a particular family of regularizers: gauges (or Minkowski functionals) of star-shaped bodies. This family contains regularizers that are commonly employed in practice and shares properties with regularizers parameterized by deep neural networks. We specifically investigate critic-based losses derived from variational representations of statistical distances between probability measures. By leveraging tools from star geometry and dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, we illustrate how these losses can be interpreted as dual mixed volumes that depend on the data distribution. This allows us to derive exact expressions for the optimal regularizer in certain cases. Finally, we identify which neural network architectures give rise to such star body gauges and when do such regularizers have favorable properties for optimization. More broadly, this work highlights how the tools of star geometry can aid in understanding the geometry of unsupervised regularizer learning.</description>
