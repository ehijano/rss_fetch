      <title>Examples of real stable bundles on K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by gauge theory on manifolds with exceptional holonomy, we construct examples of stable bundles on K3 surfaces that are invariant under two involutions: one is holomorphic; and the other is anti-holomorphic. These bundles are obtained via the monad construction, and stability is examined using the Generalised Hoppe Criterion of Jardim-Menet-Prata-S\'a Earp, which requires verifying an arithmetic condition for elements in the Picard group of the surfaces. We establish this by using computer aid in two critical steps: first, we construct K3 surfaces with small Picard group-one branched double cover of $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ with Picard rank $2$ using a new method which may be of independent interest; and second, we verify the arithmetic condition for carefully chosen elements of the Picard group, which provides a systematic approach for constructing further examples.</description>

      <title>Infinity Branches and Asymptotic Analysis of Algebraic Space Curves: New Techniques and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let C represent an irreducible algebraic space curve defined by the real polynomials fi(x1, x2, x3) for i = 1, 2. It is a recognized fact that a birational relationship invariably exists between the points on C and those on an associated irreducible plane curve, denoted as Cp. In this work, we leverage this established relationship to delineate the asymptotic behavior of C by examining the asymptotes of Cp. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel and practical algorithm designed to efficiently compute the asymptotes of C, given that the asymptotes of Cp have been ascertained.</description>

      <title>On the classification of centralizers of ODOs: An effective differential algebra approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators and algebraic curves has been extensively and deeply studied since the seminal works of Burchnall-Chaundy in 1923. This paper is an overview of recent developments to make this correspondence computationally effective, by means of differential algebra and symbolic computation.
  The centralizer of an ordinary differential operator $L$ is a maximal commutative ring, the affine ring of a spectral curve $\Gamma$. The defining ideal of $\Gamma$ is described, assuming that a finite set of generators of the centralizer is known. In addition, the factorization problem of $L-\lambda$ over a new coefficient field, defined by the coefficient field of $L$ and $\Gamma$, allows the computation of spectral sheaves on $\Gamma$. The ultimate goal is to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems $L(y)=\lambda y$, for a generic $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>A filtered Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem for real Hochschild homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of derived involutive algebras in $ C_2 $-Mackey functors which simultaneously generalize commutative rings with involution and the (non-equivariant) derived algebras of Bhatt--Mathew and Raksit. We show that the $ \infty $-category of derived involutive algebras admits involutive enhancements of the cotangent complexes, de Rham complex, and de Rham cohomology functors; furthermore, their real Hochschild homology is defined. We identify a filtration on the real Hochschild homology of these derived involutive algebras via a universal property and show that its associated graded may be identified with the involutive de Rham complex. Using $ C_2 $-$ \infty $-categories of Barwick--Dotto--Glasman--Nardin--Shah, we show that our filtered real Hochschild homology specializes to the HKR-filtered Hochschild homology considered by Raksit.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that a symmetric matrix with its entries $\pm1$ is not positive definite. But this is not ture for symmetric tensors (hyper-matrix). In this paper, we mainly dicuss the positive (semi-)definiteness criterion of a class of $4$th order $3$-dimensional symmetric tensors with entries $t_{ijkl}\in\{-1,0,1\}$. Through theoretical derivations and detailed classification discussions, the criterion for determining the positive (semi-)definiteness of such a class of tensors are provided based on the relationships and number values of its entries. Which establishes some unique properties of higher symmetric tensors that distinct from ones of matrces</description>

      <title>F-theory with hyperelliptic fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of hyperelliptic fibrations in F-theory. For each even integer $n$ we give a noncompact Calabi--Yau threefold $X$ containing a hyperelliptically fibered surface $Y$, such that $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent and $c_2(X) = n$. We investigate two distinct cases depending on the position of the hyperelliptic fibration. First, we propose to extend F-theory considering hyperelliptic fibrations, giving an identification between the determinant of the period matrix and the axio-dilaton. Such an identification requires that the curve satisfies an appropriate criterium which we describe. Our explicit examples have split Jacobian, preserve the same number of degrees of freedom of usual F-theory, while allowing for the appearance of a greater variety of singularities. Second, when the hyperelliptic fibration is contained in the base of a Calabi--Yau fourfold, we show that tadpole cancellation conditions are satisfied for arbitrarily large values of $c_2(X)$.</description>

      <title>Positivity of generalized cluster scattering diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of combinatorial objects, named tight gradings, which are certain nonnegative integer-valued functions on maximal Dyck paths. Using tight gradings, we derive a manifestly positive formula for any wall-function in a rank-2 generalized cluster scattering diagram. We further prove that any consistent rank-2 scattering diagram is positive with respect to the coefficients of initial wall-functions. Moreover, our formula yields explicit expressions for relative Gromov-Witten invariants on weighted projective planes and the Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of framed stable representations on complete bipartite quivers. Finally, by leveraging the rank-2 positivity, we show that any higher-rank generalized cluster scattering diagram has positive wall-functions, which leads to a proof of the positivity of the Laurent phenomenon and the strong positivity of Chekhov-Shapiro's generalized cluster algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider classes of codimension two Cohen--Macaulay ideals over a standard graded polynomial ring over a field. The basic drive behind the present landscapes is a thorough analysis of the related Hilbert--Burch matrix, often without assuming equigeneration, linear presentation or even the popular $G_d$ condition of Artin--Nagata. Among some of the results is a proof of a conjecture on the Jacobian ideal of a hyperplane arrangement stated by Burity, Simis and Toh\v{a}neanu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{G}(d,n)$ be the complex Grassmannian of affine $d$-planes in $n$-space. We study the problem of characterizing the set of algebraic subvarieties of $\mathbb{G}(d,n)$ invariant under the action of the maximal torus $T$ and having given homology class $\lambda$. We give a complete answer for the case where $\lambda$ is the class of a $T$-orbit, and partial results for other cases, using techniques inspired by matroid theory. This problem has applications to the computation of the Euler-Chow series for Grassmannians of projective lines: we calculate the series for 3-cycles in $\mathbb{G}(2,4)$ and carry out partial calculations for $\mathbb{G}(2,5)$.</description>

      <title>Generic flexibility of affine cones over del Pezzo surfaces in Sagemath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generic flexibility of affine cones over Fano varieties is a subject of active study recently. For del Pezzo surfaces the question is completely studied in degree at least 3, and partially in degree 2.
  We present a Sagemath module that facilitates most operations for verifying the generic flexibility of affine cones over del Pezzo surfaces and weak del Pezzo surfaces of arbitrary degree, depending on a polarization. The combinatorial approach used in this module is based on the formalism of bubble cycles and the colimit of Picard groups of blowups of the projective plane.
  As an example, we verify generic flexibility of affine cones over some polarizations of surfaces of degree 1 under certain conditions and over arbitrary very ample polarizations of weak del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \(G\) be a reductive group over a field \(k\), and let \(\mu\) be a cocharacter of \(G\). We prove that Viehmann's double coset spaces associated with \((G, \mu)\) are representable by certain Lusztig varieties, and establish a similar result for the mixed characteristic case. This representability enables a comparison between the moduli stacks of truncated local shtukas and zip stacks. Over a perfect field of positive characteristic, we establish a homeomorphism between the coarse moduli stack of \(1\text{-}1\)-truncated local \(G\)-shtukas and that of \(G\)-zips, thereby enriching our understanding of zip period maps in the context of Shimura varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a prime number $p$, we perform the study of Chow motives and motivic decompositions, with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, of projective homogeneous varieties for $p'$-inner $p$-consistent reductive algebraic groups. Assorted with the known case of $p$-inner reductive groups, our results cover all absolutely simple groups of type not $^3\!D_4$ or $^6\!D_4$, among other examples. First, we define the A-upper motives of such a reductive group $G$; they are indecomposable motives, naturally related to Artin motives built out of spectra of subextensions of a minimal extension over which $G$ become of inner type. With this in hand, we carry on the qualitative study of motivic decompositions for projective $G$-homogeneous varieties. Providing geometric isomorphism criteria for A-upper motives, we obtain a classification of motives of projective $G$-homogeneous varieties, by means of their higher Artin-Tate traces. We also show that the higher Tits $p$-indexes of the group $G$ determine its motivic equivalence class.</description>

Abstract: We construct and study relations between Chern classes and Galois cohomology classes in the Gal(C/R)-equivariant cohomology of real algebraic varieties with no real points. We give applications to the topology of their sets of complex points, and to sums of squares problems. In particular, we show that -1 is a sum of 2 squares in the function field of any smooth projective real algebraic surface with no real points and with vanishing geometric genus, as well as higher-dimensional generalizations of this result.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz geometry of complex surface germs via inner rates of primary ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X, 0)$ be a normal complex surface germ embedded in $(\mathbb{C}^n, 0)$, and denote by $\mathfrak{m}$ the maximal ideal of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$. In this paper, we associate to each $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal $I$ of $\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$ a continuous function $\mathcal{I}_I$ defined on the set of positive (suitably normalized) semivaluations of $\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$. We prove that the function $\mathcal{I}_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is determined by the outer Lipschitz geometry of the surface $(X, 0)$. We further demonstrate that for each $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal $I$, there exists a complex surface germ $(X_I, 0)$ with an isolated singularity whose normalization is isomorphic to $(X, 0)$ and $\mathcal{I}_I = \mathcal{I}_{\mathfrak{m}_I}$, where $\mathfrak{m}_I$ is the maximal ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X_I,0}$. Subsequently, we construct an infinite family of complex surface germs with isolated singularities, whose normalizations are isomorphic to $(X,0)$ (in particular, they are homeomorphic to $(X,0)$) but have distinct outer Lipschitz types.</description>

      <title>A non-abelian version of Deligne's Fixed Part Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13910v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and prove a non-abelian analog of Deligne's Fixed Part theorem on Hodge classes, revisiting previous work of Jost--Zuo, Katzarkov--Pantev and Landesman--Litt. To this aim we study algebraically isomonodromic extensions of local systems and we relate them to variations of Hodge structures, for example we show that the Mumford-Tate group at a generic point stays constant in an algebraically isomonodromic extension of a variation of Hodge structure. v2: a few typos ironed and Thm 1.1 5) completed. v3: there was a Schlamassel leading to a mix-up of files. Apologies. Else identical version (one minor change). v4 Appendix A reshaped.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approximate definable choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semialgebraic geometry, projections play a prominent role. A definable choice is a semialgebraic selection of one point in every fiber of a projection. Definable choices exist by semialgebraic triviality, but their complexity depends exponentially on the number of variables. By allowing the selection to be approximate (in the Hausdorff sense), we improve on this result. In particular, we construct an approximate selection whose degree is linear in the complexity of the projection and does not depend on the number of variables. This work is motivated by infinite-dimensional applications, in particular to the Sard conjecture in sub-Riemannian geometry. To prove these results, we develop a general quantitative theory for Hausdorff approximations in semialgebraic geometry, which has independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modified construction of a weighted generalised Grassmannian, which includes all weighted projective spaces as its special case. For a weighted Grassmannian (i.e., for series A) we obtain an explicit parametrisation of possible $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, and provide the explicit formulae for its dualising sheaf and Hilbert series in terms of this parametrisation. We expect that our approach can be generalised to other irreducible root systems.</description>

      <title>On the module of derivations of a line arrangement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $\mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span a large subspace of $D_0(\mathcal A)$. To each such derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0(\mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $\mathcal A$, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $\mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines.</description>

      <title>Linear patterns of prime elements in number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a number field analogue of the Green--Tao--Ziegler theorem on simultaneous prime values of degree 1 polynomials whose linear parts are pairwise linearly independent. This can be used to prove a Hasse principle result for certain fibrations $X\to \mathbb{P}^1$ over a number field $K$ extending a result of Harpaz--Skorobogatov--Wittenberg which was only available over $\mathbb Q $. The main technical content is the proof that the von Mangoldt function $\Lambda _K$ of a number field $K$ is well approximated by its Cramer/Siegel models in the Gowers norm sense. Via the inverse theory of the Gowers norm, this is achieved by showing that the difference of $\Lambda _K$ and its model is asymptotically orthogonal to nilsequences. To prove the asymptotic orthogonality, we use Mitsui's Prime Element Theorem as the base case and proceed by upgrading Green--Tao's type I/II sum computation to the general number field. Other applications of our results include the negative resolution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem over all number rings by Koymans--Pagano.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that de Rham--Witt forms are naturally isomorphic to $p$-typical curves on $p$-adic Tate twists, which answers a question of Artin--Mazur from 1977 pursued in the earlier work of Bloch and Kato. We show this by more generally equipping a related result of Hesselholt on topological cyclic homology with the motivic filtrations introduced by Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an integer sequence associated with Cantor's division polynomials of a genus 2 curve having an integral point. We show that the reduction modulo $p$ of such a sequence is periodic for all but finitely many primes $p$, and describe the relation between the period of the reduction modulo $p$ of the sequence and the order of the integral point on the reduction modulo $p$ in the Jacobian variety explicitly. This generalizes Ward's results on elliptic divisibility sequences associated with division polynomials of elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Projective rigidity of point-line configurations in the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general setup for studying incidence-preserving motions of projective geometric configurations of points and lines via a "projective rigidity matrix". The spaces of infinitesimal motions of a point-line configuration and dependencies amongst the point-line incidences can be interpreted as the kernel and co-kernel of this projective rigidity matrix, respectively. We also introduce a symmetry-adapted projective rigidity matrix for analysing symmetric configurations and their symmetry-preserving motions. The symmetry may be a point group or a more general symmetry, such as an autopolarity.</description>

      <title>Matroids and amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Splitting CEGM Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CEGM formalism offers a general framework for scattering amplitudes, which rests on Grassmannians, moduli spaces and tropical geometry. The physical implications of this generalization are still to be understood. Conventional wisdom says that key features of scattering amplitudes, like factorization at their poles into lower-point amplitudes, are associated to their singularities. The factorization behavior of CEGM amplitudes at their poles is interesting but complicated. Recent developments have revealed important properties of standard particle and string scattering amplitudes from factorizations, known as splits, that happen away from poles. In this paper we introduce a kinematic subspace on which the CEGM amplitude splits into very simple rational functions. These functions, called simplex amplitudes, arise from stringy integrals for the multivariate beta function, and also from restricting the biadjoint scalar amplitude in quantum field theory to certain kinematic loci. Using split kinematics we also discover a specific class of zeros of the CEGM amplitude. Our construction rests on viewing positive moduli space as a product of simplices, and it suggests a novel approach for deriving scattering amplitudes from tropical determinantal varieties.</description>
