      <title>Developing a Framework for Sonifying Variational Quantum Algorithms: Implications for Music Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter examines the Variational Quantum Harmonizer, a software tool and musical interface that focuses on the problem of sonification of the minimization steps of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA), used for simulating properties of quantum systems and optimization problems assisted by quantum hardware. Particularly, it details the sonification of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems using VQA. A flexible design enables its future applications both as a sonification tool for auditory displays in scientific investigation, and as a hybrid quantum-digital musical instrument for artistic endeavours. In turn, sonification can help researchers understand complex systems better and can serve for the training of quantum physics and quantum computing. The VQH structure, including its software implementation, control mechanisms, and sonification mappings are detailed. Moreover, it guides the design of QUBO cost functions in VQH as a music compositional object. The discussion is extended to the implications of applying quantum-assisted simulation in quantum-computer aided composition and live-coding performances. An artistic output is showcased by the piece \textit{Hexagonal Chambers} (Thomas and Itabora\'i, 2023).</description>

      <title>Scoping Sustainable Collaborative Mixed Reality</title>

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) is becoming ubiquitous as it finds its applications in education, healthcare, and other sectors beyond leisure. While MR end devices, such as headsets, have low energy intensity, the total number of devices and resource requirements of the entire MR ecosystem, which includes cloud and edge endpoints, can be significant. The resulting operational and embodied carbon footprint of MR has led to concerns about its environmental implications. Recent research has explored reducing the carbon footprint of MR devices by exploring hardware design space or network optimizations. However, many additional avenues for enhancing MR's sustainability remain open, including energy savings in non-processor components and carbon-aware optimizations in collaborative MR ecosystems. In this paper, we aim to identify key challenges, existing solutions, and promising research directions for improving MR sustainability. We explore adjacent fields of embedded and mobile computing systems for insights and outline MR-specific problems requiring new solutions. We identify the challenges that must be tackled to enable researchers, developers, and users to avail themselves of these opportunities in collaborative MR systems.</description>

      <title>C3-VQA: Cryogenic Counter-based Co-processor for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic quantum computers play a leading role in demonstrating quantum advantage. Given the severe constraints on the cooling capacity in cryogenic environments, thermal design is crucial for the scalability of these computers. The sources of heat dissipation include passive inflow via inter-temperature wires and the power consumption of components located in the cryostat, such as wire amplifiers and quantum-classical interfaces. Thus, a critical challenge is to reduce the number of wires by reducing the required inter-temperature bandwidth while maintaining minimal additional power consumption in the cryostat. One solution to address this challenge is near-data processing using ultra-low-power computational logic within the cryostat. Based on the workload analysis and domain-specific system design focused on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), we propose the Cryogenic Counter-based Co-processor for VQAs (C3-VQA) to enhance the design scalability of cryogenic quantum computers under the thermal constraint. The C3-VQA utilizes single-flux-quantum logic, which is an ultra-low-power superconducting digital circuit that operates at the 4 K environment. The C3-VQA precomputes a part of the expectation value calculations for VQAs and buffers intermediate values using simple bit operation units and counters in the cryostat, thereby reducing the required inter-temperature bandwidth with small additional power consumption. Consequently, the C3-VQA reduces the number of wires, leading to a reduction in the total heat dissipation in the cryostat. Our evaluation shows that the C3-VQA reduces the total heat dissipation at the 4 K stage by 30% and 81% under sequential-shot and parallel-shot execution scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, a case study in quantum chemistry shows that the C3-VQA reduces total heat dissipation by 87% with a 10,000-qubit system.</description>

      <title>Spike-timing-dependent-plasticity learning in a planar magnetic domain wall artificial synapsis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future neuromorphic architectures will require millions of artificial synapses, making understanding the physical mechanisms behind their plasticity functionalities mandatory. In this work, we propose a simplified spin memristor, where the resistance can be controlled by magnetic field pulses, based on a Co/Pt multilayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as a synapsis emulator. We demonstrate plasticity and spike time dependence plasticity (STDP) in this device and explored the underlying magnetic mechanisms using Kerr microscopy imaging and Hall magneto-transport measurements. A well-defined threshold for magnetization reversal and the continuous resistance states associated with the micromagnetic configuration are the basic properties allowing plasticity and STDP learning mechanisms in this device.</description>

      <title>Q-Pilot: Field Programmable Qubit Array Compilation with Flying Ancillas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16190</link>

Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have become a promising platform for quantum computing, especially the field programmable qubit array (FPQA) endowed with the unique capability of atom movement. This feature allows dynamic alterations in qubit connectivity during runtime, which can reduce the cost of executing long-range gates and improve parallelism. However, this added flexibility introduces new challenges in circuit compilation. Inspired by the placement and routing strategies for FPGAs, we propose to map all data qubits to fixed atoms while utilizing movable atoms to route for 2-qubit gates between data qubits. Coined flying ancillas, these mobile atoms function as ancilla qubits, dynamically generated and recycled during execution. We present Q-Pilot, a scalable compiler for FPQA employing flying ancillas to maximize circuit parallelism. For two important quantum applications, quantum simulation and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we devise domain-specific routing strategies. In comparison to alternative technologies such as superconducting devices or fixed atom arrays, Q-Pilot effectively harnesses the flexibility of FPQA, achieving reductions of 1.4x, 27.7x, and 6.3x in circuit depth for 100-qubit random, quantum simulation, and QAOA circuits, respectively.</description>

      <title>Lightcone Bounds for Quantum Circuit Mapping via Uncomplexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently mapping quantum circuits onto hardware is an integral part of the quantum compilation process, wherein a circuit is modified in accordance with the stringent architectural demands of a quantum processor. Many techniques exist for solving the quantum circuit mapping problem, in addition to several theoretical perspectives that relate quantum circuit mapping to problems in classical computer science. This work considers a novel perspective on quantum circuit mapping, in which the routing process of a simplified circuit is viewed as a composition of quantum operations acting on density matrices representing the quantum circuit and processor. Drawing on insight from recent advances in quantum circuit complexity and information geometry, we show that a minimal SWAP-gate count for executing a quantum circuit on a device emerges via the minimization of the distance between quantum states using the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, which we dub the lightcone bound. Additionally, we develop a novel initial placement algorithm based on a graph similarity search that selects the partition nearest to a graph isomorphism between interaction and coupling graphs. From these two ingredients, we construct an algorithm for calculating the lightcone bound, which is directly compared alongside the IBM Qiskit compiler for over $600$ realistic benchmark experiments, as well as against a brute-force method for smaller benchmarks. In our simulations, we unambiguously find that neither the brute-force method nor the Qiskit compiler surpasses our bound, signaling utility for estimating minimal overhead when realizing quantum algorithms on constrained quantum hardware. This work also constitutes the first use of quantum circuit uncomplexity to practically-relevant quantum computing. We anticipate that this method may have diverse applicability outside of the scope of quantum information science.</description>
