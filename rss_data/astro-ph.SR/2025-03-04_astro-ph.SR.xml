      <title>Nuclear Neural Networks: Emulating Late Burning Stages in Core Collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in modeling massive stars to the onset of core collapse is the computational bottleneck of nucleosynthesis during advanced burning stages. The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of fully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the simulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability. To overcome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with multiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate its performance. The NNN takes the temperature, density and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting isotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates. We generate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core depletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the predictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net. We find that the NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by $280-660\:\%$ and the nuclear energy generation by $250-750\:\%$, consistently outperforming the small network across all timesteps. They also achieve significantly better predictions of neutrino losses on relatively short timescales, with improvements ranging from $100-10^{6}\:\%$. While further work is needed to enhance their accuracy and applicability to different stellar conditions, integrating NNN trained models into stellar evolution codes is promising for facilitating large-scale generation of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors with higher physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>The intriguing outcomes of double degenerate mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review talk explores the diverse outcomes of white dwarf mergers, emphasising that not all double degenerate mergers result in supernovae. Possible outcomes include the formation of a more massive WD, partial explosions that leave behind unusual remnants, and merger-induced collapse leading to the formation of rapidly spinning neutron stars or magnetars. Additionally, merging WDs have been proposed as potential progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts and Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

      <title>Filling the gap: the missing eclipses of $\gamma$ Persei from 2005 and from 2006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\gamma$ Persei is a long-period ($P \approx 14.6$ yr) eclipsing binary system. Its period makes it a difficult target to fully understand: so far, only two primary eclipses are known in the literature, from 1990 and from 2019, whereas the 2005 one was missed due to its closeness to the Sun at the time. We aimed to fill in this gap by processing the quasi-continuous photometry collected by the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) between 2003 and 2011, which was ideally positioned to observe such a bright targets. In order to do that, we first determined a color-dependent conversion formula from the SMEI measurements into {\it Gaia} \textit{G} magnitudes. We applied various corrections to the photometry and provide the longest continuous light curve of $\gamma$ Persei. We successfully detected the 2005 primary eclipse of the system, with the yearly observations ending during the egress of the companion. We predicted the position of a possible secondary eclipse by forward modeling the binary system with PHOEBE, and successfully recovered the secondary eclipse in the 2006 SMEI observations. The existence of the secondary eclipse puts strong constraints on the orbital configuration, which will be an important constraint for future studies of the system.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Electron Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On electron kinetic scales, ions and electrons decouple, and electron velocity shear on electron inertial length $\sim d_e$ can trigger electromagnetic (EM) electron Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (EKHI). In this paper, we present an analytic study of EM EKHI in an inviscid collisionless plasma with a step-function electron shear flow. We show that in incompressible collisionless plasma the ideal electron frozen-in condition $\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_e \times \mathbf{B}/c = 0$ must be broken for the EM EKHI to occur. In a step-function electron shear flow, the ideal electron frozen-in condition is replaced by magnetic flux conservation, i.e., $\nabla \times (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_e\times \mathbf{B}/c) = 0$, resulting in a dispersion relation similar to that of the standard ideal and incompressible magnetohydrodynamics KHI. The magnetic field parallel to the electron streaming suppresses the EM EKHI due to magnetic tension. The threshold for the EM mode of the EKHI is $(\mathbf{k}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{U}_e)^2&gt;\frac{n_{e1}+n_{e2}}{n_{e1} n_{e2}}[n_{e1}(\mathbf{v}_{Ae1}\cdot\mathbf{k})^2+n_{e2}(\mathbf{v}_{Ae2}\cdot\mathbf{k})^2]$, where $\mathbf{v}_{Ae} =\mathbf{B}/(4\pi m_e n_e)^{1/2}$, $\Delta\mathbf{U}_e$ and $n_e$ are the electron streaming velocity shear and densities, respectively. The growth rate of the EM mode is $\gamma_{em} \sim \Omega_{ce}$, the electron gyro-frequency.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Nova Simulations with an Extended Buffer and Lower Initial Mixing Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway initiated on a white dwarf accreting solar-like material from its stellar companion. Once the white dwarf accretes enough mass, the pressure at the base of the accreted layer reaches a critical point, leading to the ignition of the hydrogen fuel at their interface. This paper presents a set of two-dimensional CO classical nova simulations with an extended buffer zone of a fixed low density and temperature between the top of the accreted layer and the upper boundary, allowing us to capture the thermonuclear outburst in the domain. Our domain reduces the role of the upper-outflow boundary condition that has affected previous simulations and allows us to explore the nucleosynthesis evolution in detail. We also study the effects of the initial temperature perturbation and buffer size to explore their sensitivity in our simulations. Finally, we start our simulations with a lower temperature at the base of the accreted layer ($7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{K}$) than previous work, allowing us to capture mixing earlier in the evolution, reducing the effects of the mixing-length-theory assumptions. This allows for a more realistic description of convective transport in our models.</description>

      <title>Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids II. Empirical constraints on non-linear period changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are not only excellent standard candles, but also invaluable tools to test stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Rates of their pulsation period change, quantified usually through $O-C$ diagrams, can be confronted with predictions of stellar evolution theory. On the other hand, period changes on much shorter time scales ($\sim$10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$days), attributed to non-evolutionary effects are often detected and lack detailed explanation. We aim to provide a systematic and quantitative description of irregular or non-linear period changes in Cepheids. We aim to provide a systematic and quantitative description of irregular or non-linear period changes in Cepheids. We analysed part of the OGLE data for classical Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs; from both Large Magellanic Cloud, LMC, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC) using the modified Hertzsprung $O-C$ technique. A sample of 3658 stars, with the best quality data and void of additional low-amplitude periodicities (e.g. due to non-radial pulsations), that could impact the results, was selected for analysis. Based on $O-C$ shapes, stars were classified into three categories: no period change (class 1), linear period change (class 2), and irregular change (class 3). In our investigation, $33.5\pm0.7$\% of analysed stars show irregular period changes. Considering the pulsation mode, irregular period changes were detected in $16.5\pm0.7$\% of the analysed fundamental mode stars and in $68.1\pm1.2$\% of the first overtone stars. The amplitude of variability in the $O-C$ diagrams increases with the pulsation period, and at a given pulsation period, it is larger for first overtone stars. While the increase is linear for first overtone stars, for fundamental mode stars it becomes steeper as the pulsation period increases.</description>

      <title>Linking Critical Heights in Solar Active Regions with 3D CME Speeds: Insights from Automated and Manual PIL Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a space weather context, the most geoeffective coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are fast CMEs from Earth-facing solar active regions. These CMEs are difficult to characterize in coronagraph data due to their high speed (fewer observations), faintness, Earthward orientation (halo CMEs), and disruptions from associated high-energy particle storms. Any diagnostic aiding in early CME speed identification is valuable. This study investigates whether the 3D speeds of 37 CMEs are correlated with the critical heights of their source regions, to test the hypothesis that if the critical height is located at a higher altitude in the corona, the weaker magnetic field environment will enable a faster CME to be produced. Critical heights near CME onset are calculated by identifying polarity inversion lines (PIL) in magnetogram data using automated and manual methods. 3D speeds are determined by fitting a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to multi-viewpoint coronagraph images. For the automated method, we find a high correlation of 71% +- 8% between CME speed and critical height, dropping to 48% +- 12% when using CME plane-of-sky speeds, on which most previous similar studies are based. An attempt to improve the critical height diagnostic through manual PIL selection yields a lower correlation of 58% +/- 13%. The higher correlation from the automated method suggests that encompassing the full PIL structure is a better measure of the magnetic conditions that influence CME dynamics. Our results highlight the potential for critical height as a continuously computable diagnostic for forecasting the 3D speeds of Earth-directed CMEs.</description>

      <title>How the CME on 21 April 2023 Triggered the First Severe Geomagnetic Storm of Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first severe (G4) geomagnetic storm of Solar Cycle 25 occurred on 23-24 April 2023, following the arrival of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on 23 April. The characteristics of this CME, measured from coronagraphs (speed and mass), did not indicate that it would trigger such an intense geomagnetic storm. In this work, our aim is to understand why this CME led to such a geoeffective outcome. Our analysis spans from the source active region to the corona and inner heliosphere through 1 au using multiwavelength, multi-viewpoint remote sensing observations and in situ data. We find that rotation and possibly deflection of the CME resulted in an axial magnetic field nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane during the Earth encounter, which might explain the storm's severity. Additionally, we find that imaging away from the Sun-Earth line is crucial in hindcasting the CME Time-of-Arrival at Earth. The position (0.39 au) and detailed images from the SoloHI telescope onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, in combination with SOHO and STEREO images, helped decisively with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the CME.</description>

      <title>Solar Cycle Prediction Using TCN Deep Learning Model with One-Step Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human living environment is influenced by intense solar activity. The solar activity exhibits periodicity and regularity. Although many deep-learning models are currently used for solar cycle prediction, most of them are based on a multi-step pattern. In this paper a solar cycle prediction method based on a one-step pattern is proposed with the TCN neural network model, in which a number of historical data are input, and only one value is predicted at a time. Through an autoregressive strategy, this predicted value is added to the input sequence to generate the next output. This process is iterated until the prediction of multiple future data. The experiments were performed on the 13-month smoothed monthly total sunspot number data sourced from WDC-SILSO. The results showed that one-step pattern fits the solar cycles from 20-25 well. The average fitting errors are MAE=1.74, RMSE=2.34. Finally, the intensity of Solar Cycle 25 was predicted with one-step pattern. The peak will occur in 2024 October with a magnitude of 135.3 and end in 2030 November. By comparing the prediction results with other methods, our method are more reasonable and better than the most methods.

      <title>The highly magnetic Wolf-Rayet binary HD 45166 resolved with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 45166 was recently reported to be a long-period binary comprising a B7V star and a highly magnetic ($\langle B \rangle = 43.0\pm0.5\,$kG) hot Wolf-Rayet-like component, dubbed as a quasi Wolf-Rayet (qWR) star in literature. While originally proposed to be a short-period binary, long-term spectroscopic monitoring suggested a 22.5 yr orbital period. With a derived dynamical mass of $2.03\pm0.44\,M_\odot$, the qWR component is the most strongly magnetized non-degenerate object ever detected and a potential magnetar progenitor. However, the long period renders the spectroscopic orbital solution and dynamical mass estimates uncertain, casting doubts on whether the qWR component is massive enough to undergo core-collapse. Here, we spatially resolve the HD 45166 binary using newly acquired interferometric data obtained with the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Due to the calibrator star being a binary as well, we implement a new approach for visibility calibration and test it thoroughly using archival GRAVITY data. The newly calibrated HD 45166 data reveal the unmistakable presence of a companion to the qWR component with an angular separation of $10.9\pm0.1$ mas (which translates to a projected physical separation of $10.8\pm0.4$ au), consistent with the long-period orbit. We obtain a model-independent qWR mass $M_{\rm qWR} = 1.96^{+0.74}_{-0.54}\,M_\odot$ using interferometric and spectroscopic data together. This observation robustly confirms that HD 45166 is truly a long-period binary, and provides an anchor point for accurate mass determination of the qWR component with further observations.</description>

      <title>Search for binary-channel metal-rich RR~Lyrae candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of dynamically young and metal-rich RR Lyrae stars challenges conventional notions of these variable stars. One possible scenario for their formation and evolution is via binary channels involving mass transfer. This study presents the detection of nine fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars residing in the thin disk of the Milky Way with metallicities higher than [Fe/H] &gt; -1.0 dex and showing proper motion anomalies. Our thin disk classification is based on kinematics and supported by $\alpha$-element abundances, where possible. We searched for indications of the light-travel time effect (LTTE) in the available literature sources and the TESS photometric data of the stars but found no signs of periodic variations induced by companions within the expected period range. This could be because of a lack of observations as well as sparse measurements and large gaps in the data. We propose a continued search for signs of binarity and a subsequent long-term follow-up of nine targets that satisfy all of our search criteria. Beyond these targets, we also report the detection of slow phase changes in the Blazhko star ST Pic, which could be compatible with the LTTE.</description>

      <title>Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.</description>

      <title>Transient narrow high-velocity absorptions in the stationary spectra of SS433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of rare emergence (31 nights from 360 nights of observations) of narrow absorption features in hydrogen and helium lines in stationary SS433 spectra with velocities ranging from $-650$ to $-1900$ km/s. The components arise independently of the appearance of P-Cygni line profiles which are frequently observed in the SS433 stationary spectra with terminal velocities ranging from $-200$ to $\sim -2500$ km/s. The characteristic rising time of the transient absorptions is about one day and the decay time is about two days. The phenomenology of the absorptions suggests their origin due to hydrodynamic instabilities of wind outflows from a supercritical accretion disk in SS433.</description>

      <title>Generalized Two Thermal Regimes Approach : Bipoly Fluid Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isopoly bi-fluid approach assumes an isothermal evolution of the solar wind near the Sun up to the radial distance riso, followed by a polytropic evolution constrained by the observed polytropic indices. This approach provides a more accurate model of the interplanetary properties of the solar wind (u, n, Tp, Te) and their radial evolution (Dakeyo et al. 2022, 2024). In this article, we present an improvement of the isopoly approach by considering a generalized two thermal regime approach, embedding two distinct polytropic evolutions, the "bipoly" modeling. To demonstrate the capability of the approach, the models are fitted to both interplanetary and coronal observations, all classified by wind speed population in the spirit of Maksimovic et al. (2020). The set of observations used as constraints are coronal temperatures inferred from charge-state ratio observations from Solar Orbiter, and interplanetary measurements from Helios and Parker Solar Probe. The relaxation of the isothermal criteria in the near-Sun region permits to significantly improve the fast wind acceleration for low coronal temperature conditions. In summary, the new model matches closely the observational constraints: the coronal temperature and the radial evolution of the wind properties (u, n, Tp, Te) in the interplanetary medium, and this for all the wind speed populations.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Deformation of Coronal Mass Ejections on Their In-Situ Fitting with Circular-Cross-Section Flux Rope Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties, especially the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) invariants, of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) measured in-situ is key to bridging the CME properties from the Sun to interplanetary space. In order to investigate CMEs from the in-situ measurements that provide a one-dimensional (1-D) cut of the CME parameters over the spacecraft trajectory, various magnetic flux rope (MFR) models have been developed, among which the models with a circular cross-section are the most popular and widely used. CMEs are found to be deformed during their propagation in interplanetary space, in which the cross-section may be flattened in the direction of propagation, i.e., to develop an elliptical or even pancake-like shape. We use numerical MHD simulations in 2.5-D to investigate the influence of the CME deformation on the in-situ fitting using two linear force-free MFR models with a circular cross-section, and we focus on the axial and poloidal magnetic fluxes, which are conserved in the ideal MHD frame and simulations. We quantitatively compare the fitted axial and poloidal fluxes with those in simulations. We find that both models underestimate the axial flux compared to that in simulations, and such underestimation depends on the CME deformation. However, the fitting of the poloidal flux is independent of the deformation. We discuss the reasons for the axial flux underestimation and the implication of the CME deformation for the CME in-situ fitting.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Subclustering and Star Formation Efficiency in Three Protoclusters in the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present so far the highest resolution ($\sim$0.04") ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of three massive star-forming clumps in the Central Molecular Zone, namely 20 km s$^{-1}$ C1, 20 km $^{-1}$ C4, and Sgr C C4, which reveal prevalent compact millimeter emission. We extract the compact emission with $\textit{astrodendro}$ and identify a total of 199 fragments with a typical size of $\sim$370 AU, which represent the first sample of candidates of protostellar envelopes and disks and kernels of prestellar cores in these clumps that are likely forming star clusters. Compared with the protoclusters in the Galactic disk, the three protoclusters display a higher level of hierarchical clustering, likely a result of the stronger turbulence in the CMZ clumps. Compared with the mini-starbursts in the CMZ, Sgr B2 M and N, the three protoclusters also show stronger subclustering in conjunction with a lack of massive fragments. The efficiency of high-mass star formation of the three protoclusters is on average one order of magnitude lower than that of Sgr B2 M and N, despite a similar overall efficiency of converting gas into stars. The lower efficiency of high-mass star formation in the three protoclusters is likely attributed to hierarchical cluster formation.</description>

      <title>Dust coagulation assisted by streaming instability in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The streaming instability is a promising mechanism for planetesimal formation. The instability can rapidly form dense clumps that collapse self-gravitationally, which is efficient for large dust grains with the Stokes number on the order of 0.1. However, dust growth models predict that collisional fragmentation prevents dust grains from growing to such sizes. We perform local simulations of the streaming instability and measure characteristic collision velocities and collision rates of dust grains based on their trajectories in moderate clumping. The collision velocities are on the order of 0.1 percent of the sound speed or lower, implying that dust grains can overcome the fragmentation barrier via the clumping. We also find that the collision rates are appreciably high regardless of the low collision velocities. Corresponding timescales are on the order of ten Keplerian periods or shorter, suggesting that dust grains can overcome the drift barrier as well. This streaming-instability-assisted (SI-assisted) coagulation greatly relaxes the conditions for planetesimal formation as recently implied.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in virtual: II. Origin of skewness and dual fraction processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon in physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous simulations and observations have shown that the probability density functions (PDFs) of gas densities in supersonic systems tend to be skewed, exhibiting low-density exponential tails on the $s = \ln{\rho}$ scale. In this work, we argue that these exponential tails originate from the convolution of PDF kernels with skewed tails, which can appear at both ends of the PDF. We introduce two density-fraction strategies -- the mass-fraction and volume-fraction approaches -- to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels. The PDF kernels constructed in this work satisfy the relation that its structural entropy equals the PDF variance, as we proposed in Paper I. These two types of PDF kernels define two spaces of skewed PDFs, which are dual to each other and possess highly symmetric mathematical structures. We thus speculate that the high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be related to the power-law tails of the column-density PDFs (on the $\rho$ scale) of molecular clouds, which are shaped by both turbulence and gravity. Inspired by this, we further construct a form of an `isothermal' turbulent system that likely favors the volume-fraction strategy.</description>

      <title>Back to business: SLX 1746--331 after 13 years of silence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole candidate system SLX 1746--331 was back to business in 2023, after a long silence of roughly 13 years. An outburst was observed thoroughly by \textit{Insight}-HXMT and \textit{NICER}. The outburst is characterized by spectral dominance of the soft state, where the joint \textit{Insight}-HXMT and \textit{NICER} spectral analysis shows the temperature dependence of the disk flux follows $T_{\rm in}^{3.98}$, and thus suggests that the inner disk reaches to ISCO during almost the entire outburst. By assuming 0.3 $L_{\rm Edd}$ for the peak flux and an inclination angle of zero degrees, the lower limit of the compact object hosted in this system is estimated as 3.28$\pm 2.14 M_\odot$. We also look into the relation of the disk temperature and disk flux for a sample of black hole systems, and by taking the disk temperature derived in the outburst of SLX 1746--331, such a relation results in a mass estimation of $5.2 \pm 4.5M_\odot$. Finally, the spin of the compact object is constrained to larger than 0.8 with a spectral model of kerrbb.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the explosive end-points of stellar evolution for $M_{ZAMS} \gtrsim 8$ $M_\odot$ stars. The cores of these stars collapse to neutron stars, a process in which high neutrino luminosity drives off the overlying stellar layers, which get ejected with thousands of kilometers per second. These supernovae enrich their host galaxies with elements made both during the star's life and in the explosion, providing the main cosmic source of elements such as oxygen, neon and silicon. Their high luminosities ($\sim$ $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak) make SNe beacons to large distances, and their light curves and spectra provide rich information on single and binary stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis, and a diverse set of high-energy physical processes. As the SN ejecta sweep up circumstellar and interstellar matter, it eventually enters a supernova remnant phase, exemplified by nearby, spatially resolved remnants such as Cas A and the Crab Nebula. In this phase, shocks and pulsar winds continue to light up the interior of the exploded stars, giving detailed information about their 3D structure. We review the central concepts of CCSNe, from the late stages of evolution of massive stars, through collapse, explosion, and electromagnetic display, to the final remnant phase. We briefly discuss still open questions, and current and future research avenues.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos from dense environments are unique laboratories for astrophysics, particle physics and many-body physics. They tell us about the last stages of the gravitational core-collapse and the explosion of massive stars. These elusive particles are also tightly linked to heavy elements synthesis in gravitational core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, or play a pivotal role at the MeV epoch during the Universe expansion. We highlight theoretical and observational aspects of this interesting domain, in particular for the future measurement of neutrinos from the next core-collapse supernova, and of the diffuse supernova background, whose discovery might lie in the forthcoming future.</description>

      <title>A kinematically constrained kick distribution for isolated neutron stars</title>

Abstract: The magnitudes of the velocity kicks that neutron stars (NSs) obtain at their formation have long been a topic of discussion, with the latest studies analysing the velocities of young pulsars and favouring a bimodal kick distribution. In previous work, a novel method was proposed to determine kicks based on the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories. We applied this method to the isolated pulsars with known parallax in order to kinematically constrain the NS natal kick distribution and investigate its proposed bimodality. Since this method is applicable to older pulsars, we effectively increase the sample size with ${\sim}50\%$ compared to the pulsars younger than $10$ Myr. We assumed the velocity vectors of the pulsars to be distributed isotropically in the local standard of rest frame. These velocity vectors were used to trace back the trajectories of the NSs through the Galaxy and estimate their eccentricity. Then, we simulated kicked objects in order to evaluate the relationship between kick magnitude and Galactic eccentricity, which was used to infer the kicks corresponding to the estimated eccentricities. The resulting kick distributions indeed show a bimodal structure for young pulsars. However, for older pulsars the bimodality vanishes and instead we find a log-normal kick distribution peaking at ${\sim}200$ km/s and a median of ${\sim}400$ km/s. We therefore conclude that the natal kicks of these isolated NSs are best described by log-normal distribution with $\mu=6.38$ and $\sigma=1.01$. This analysis reveals no evidence for bimodality in the larger sample, and we suggest that the bimodality found by existing literature may be caused by Poisson noise due to their relatively small sample size.</description>

      <title>SN 2024ggi: another year, another striking Type II supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova that exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 at a distance of approximately 7 Mpc, making it one of the closest supernovae of the decade. This SN shows clear signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar material, and several studies have investigated the properties of its possible progenitor star using pre-explosion data. In this work we aim to constrain the progenitor properties of SN 2024ggi by performing hydrodynamical modeling of its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024ggi obtained in the Complejo Astron\'omico El Leoncito, in Las Campanas Observatory, and in Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, spanning from 2 to 106 days after explosion. We constructed its bolometric light curve and we characterize it by calculating its morphological parameters. Then, we computed a grid of one dimensional explosion models for evolved stars with varying masses and estimated the properties of the progenitor star of SN 2024ggi by comparing the models to the observations. The observed bolometric luminosity and expansion velocities are well-matched by a model involving the explosion of a star in the presence of a close circumstellar material (CSM), with a zero-age main sequence mass of $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}$ = 15 $M_{\odot}$, a pre-SN mass and radius of 14.1 $M_{\odot}$ and 517 $R_{\odot}$, respectively, an explosion energy of $1.3\times10^{51}$ erg, and a nickel mass below 0.035 $M_{\odot}$. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor suffered a mass-loss rate of $4 \times 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, confined to a distance of 3000 $R_{\odot}$. The CSM distribution is likely a two-component structure that consists of a compact core and an extended tail. This analysis represents the first hydrodynamical model of SN 2024ggi with a complete coverage of the plateau phase.</description>

      <title>Gone with the wind: the outward migration of eccentric giant planets in windy disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that circumstellar disks exhibit weak turbulence, with their dynamics and evolution being primarily influenced by magnetic winds. However, most numerical studies have focused on planet-disk interactions in turbulent disk models. We aim to explore how wind-driven accretion affects the orbital and eccentricity evolution of a Jovian planet within a magnetized disk. Conversely, we seek to determine in what extent such a planet can modify the accretion behavior and the wind dynamics. We perform high-resolution 3D global non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a massive gap-carving planet interacting with a wind-launching disk, using the accelerated code IDEFIX. We consider the influence of the gap shape on planet migration by restarting a "fixed-planet" simulation at three different times, from which the planet evolves freely in the disk. For a strong initial magnetization and a sufficiently deep planet gap, we find that the planet becomes moderately eccentric, and its migration is slow, unsteady and mostly outward. This migration pattern is due to the gap's radial asymmetry which enhances the inner Lindblad torque while reducing the outer Lindblad torque. We show that eccentricity can grow up to 6-8% and is likely driven by a finite-amplitude instability triggered by first-order external Lindblad resonances. These moderate eccentricity values periodically modulate the gap accretion rate and wind mass loss rate, possibly leading to the formation of discrete structures in CO outflows. Slow outward migration and eccentricity growth appear to be common outcomes of planet-disk-wind interactions, which may contribute significantly to both the long orbital periods and the moderate eccentricities of warm jupiters. Additionally, eccentric massive protoplanets embedded in circumstellar disks could play a role in generating structured outflows.</description>

      <title>Evolution of stars with 60 and 200 Msun: predictions for WNh stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14165v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in detail the evolution of two massive stars at solar metallicity ($Z=0.014$), by calculating their final masses, radial expansion, and chemical enrichment. We run evolutionary models for initial masses 60 and 200 $M_\odot$, using MESA and the Geneva-evolution-code (GENEC). For the mass loss, we adopt the self-consistent m-CAK prescription for the optically thin winds of OB-type stars, a semi-empirical formula for H-rich optically thick wind of WNh stars, and a hydrodynamically consistent formula for the H-poor thick wind of classical Wolf-Rayet stars. The transition from thin to thick winds is set at $\Gamma_\text{e}=0.5$.
  For the 60 $M_\odot$ case, the GENEC model predicts a more efficient rotational mixing and more chemically homogeneous evolution, whereas the MESA model predicts a large radial expansion reaching the LBV phase. For the 200 $M_\odot$ case, differences between both evolution codes are less relevant because their evolution is dominated by wind mass loss with a weaker dependence on internal mixing.
  The switch of the mass-loss prescription based on the Eddington factor instead of the removal of outer layers, implies the existence of WNh stars with a large mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface ($X_\text{surf}\ge0.3$) formed from initial masses of $\gtrsim60$ $M_\odot$. These stars are constrained in a $T_\text{eff}$ range of the HRD which corresponds to the MS band, in agreement with the observations of Galactic WNh stars at $Z=0.014$. While our models employ a fixed $\Gamma_\text{e,trans}$ threshold for the switch to thick winds, rather than a continuous thin-to-thick wind model, the good reproduction of observations during the MS supports the robustness of the wind model upgrades, allowing its application to studies of late-stage stellar evolution before core collapse.</description>

      <title>Resolving Pleiades binary stars with Gaia and speckle interferometric observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pleiades is the most prominent open star cluster visible from Earth and an important benchmark for simple stellar populations, unified by common origin, age, and distance. Binary stars are its essential ingredient, yet their contribution remains uncertain due to heavy observational biases. A resolved multiplicity survey was conducted for a magnitude-limited G &lt; 15mag sample of 423 potential cluster members, including sources with poorly fitted astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3. Speckle interferometric observations at the 2.5 meter telescope of SAI MSU observatory were combined with Gaia data, enabling the identification of 61 resolved binary or multiple systems within the 0.04 - 10 arcsec (5 - 1350 au) separation range. With speckle observations, we discovered 21 components in 20 systems. The existence of a Merope (23 Tau) companion is confirmed after several previous unsuccessful attempts. We show that the Gaia multipeak fraction is a strong predictor of subarcsecond multiplicity, as all sources with ipd_frac_multi_peak &gt; 4% are successfully resolved. We found that 10% of Pleiades stars have a companion with a mass ratio q &gt; 0.5 within projected separation of 27 &lt; s &lt; 1350 au, and confirm a deficit of wide binaries with s &gt; 300 au. An observed dearth of wide pairs with large mass ratio (q &gt; 0.55) may imprint the transition from hard to soft binaries regime at the early stages of cluster evolution. The total binary fraction for q &gt; 0.5 systems is extrapolated to be around 25%.</description>

      <title>Improving Our Knowledge of the Solar Near-Surface Shear Layer: The Special Case of the Leptocline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the solar activity cycle was linked from the outset to the observation of the temporal variability of sunspots, which we know to be the result of complex processes associated with the dynamics of inner layers. Numerous recent studies have highlighted changes in the Sun's Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL), pointing to the role of the leptocline, a shallow and sharp rotational shear layer in the top around 8 Mm. The leptocline, mainly characterized by a strong radial rotational gradient at middle latitudes and self-organized meridional flows, is the cradle of numerous phenomena: opacity, superadiabaticity, and turbulent pressure changes; the hydrogen and helium ionization processes; a sharp decrease in the sound speed; and, probably, variations of the seismic radius associated with a nonmonotonic expansion of subsurface layers with depth. In addition, the leptocline may play a key role in forming the magnetic butterfly diagram. Such results are a starting point for further systematic investigations of the structure and dynamics of this layer, which will lead to a better understanding of solar activity.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. II. Long-Timescale Variables including Wide Binary and Late Thermal Pulse Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this second paper on the variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we focus on the 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a 980 day periodic variability with strange characteristics: 'triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. We speculate this to be a wide but eccentric binary with the same orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of 700 days and 230 days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at 1.18 hours which can either be from a close inner binary or pulsational origin. We present CTSS 2 and PN K 3-5 which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPN known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. These appear to be late thermal pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase, though alternative explanations are possible. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1 showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. We think that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.00002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manuscript New Theory of Sunspots was identified and attributed to the Jesuit astronomer and hydrographer from Marseille Esprit Pezenas (1692-1776) during the year 2002, during the systematic search for papers concerning him in the various French funds. The manuscript, in large part unpublished, New Theory of Sunspots was written by astronomer and professor of Marseilles Jesuit hydrography, Father Esprit Pezenas (1692-1776). The text was composed and revised between the years 1766 and 1772. In this manuscript, of which we are going to study the conditions of its composition, P. Pezenas gives one of the last geometric methods, related graphical methods, allowing the inclination of the Sun's equator to be deduced on ecliptic, using three observations of a sunspot, at given times, and in taking into account the movement of the Earth with respect to the Sun during the duration of observations. This text contains all the digital elements allowing to follow and understand the application of geometric processing methods of observations and observation techniques mentioned above in the introduction: passages of edges and Sun spots at the meridian, use of objective micrometers and wire micrometers. At detour of his calculations, Father Pezenas announces a duration of about 26 days and 9 hours for the rotation of the Sun around its axis, comments on and corrects some observation data published in Le Monnier's Heavenly History.</description>

      <title>Formation and Evolution of Accreting Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting compact objects are crucial to understand several important astrophysical phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae, gravitational waves, or X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bursts. In addition, they are natural laboratories to infer fundamental properties of stars, to investigate high-energy phenomena and accretion processes, to test theories of stellar and binary evolution, to explore interactions between high-density plasma and very strong magnetic fields, to examine the interplay between binary evolution and dynamical interactions (in the case they belong to dense star clusters), and they can even be used as a probe for the assembling process of galaxies over cosmic time-scales. Despite the fundamental importance of accreting compact objects for astrophysics and recent progress with the comprehension of these fascinating objects, we still do not fully understand how they form and evolve. In this chapter, we will review the current theoretical status of our knowledge on these objects, and will discuss standing problems and potential solutions to them.</description>

      <title>On the age distribution of Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the positive correlation between age and Galactocentric distance seen in Galactic Classical Cepheids, which at first sight may seem counter-intuitive in the context of inside-out galaxy formation. To explain it, we use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model and a simulation of star particles in the Galactic disc coupled with stellar evolutionary models. We then select Classical Cepheids from this simulation and test in qualitative terms which ingredients are necessary to find agreement with the observational data. We show that the interplay of the Galactic disc's metallicity gradient and the metallicity dependence of the Cepheids' life-time in the instability strip results in a pronounced positive age-Galactocentric distance relation. This renders a reconstruction of the recent star-formation history based on Classical Cepheids unrealistic. It also has important consequences on our interpretation of the observed scatter about the radial metallicity gradient measured with Galactic Classical Cepheids.</description>

      <title>Follow the Mass -- A Concordance Picture of Tidal Disruption Events</title>

Abstract: Three recent global simulations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have produced, using different numerical techniques and parameters, very similar pictures of their dynamics. In typical TDEs, after the star is disrupted by a supermassive black hole, the bound portion of the stellar debris follows highly eccentric trajectories, reaching apocenters of several thousand gravitational radii. Only a very small fraction is captured upon returning to the vicinity of the supermassive black hole. Nearly all the debris returns to the apocenter, where shocks produce a thick irregular cloud on this radial scale and power the optical/UV flare. These simulation results imply that over a few years, the thick cloud settles into an accretion flow responsible for the long term emission. Despite not being designed to match observations, and without adjusting any parameters, the dynamical picture given by the three simulations aligns well with observations of typical events, correctly predicting the flares' typical total radiated energy, luminosity, temperature and emission line width. On the basis of these predictions, we provide an updated method (TDEmass) to infer the stellar and black hole masses from a flare's peak luminosity and temperature. This picture also correctly predicts that the luminosity observed years after the flare should be nearly constant. In addition, we show that in a magnitude-limited survey, if the intrinsic rate of TDEs is independent of black hole mass, the detected events will preferentially have black hole masses $\sim 10^{6.3 \pm 0.3} M_\odot$ and stellar masses $\sim 1 M_\odot$, with the width of the mass distribution for disrupted stars sensitive to the stellar mass function in the host galaxy's center.</description>

      <title>Formation of free-floating planetary mass objects via circumstellar disk encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of planetary mass objects (PMOs) wandering in young star clusters remains enigmatic, especially when they come in pairs. They could represent the lowest-mass object formed via molecular cloud collapse or high-mass planets ejected from their host stars. However, neither theory fully accounts for their abundance and multiplicity. Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridges between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity. PMOs may thus form a distinct population that is fundamentally different from stars and planets.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties through parity-violating electron scattering experiments and relativistic point coupling interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15936</link>

Abstract: Parity-violating electron scattering experiments on $\rm ^{48}Ca$ (CREX) and $\rm ^{208}Pb$ (PREX-2) offer valuable insight into the isovector properties of finite nuclei, providing constraints for the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we establish functional dependencies between the properties of finite nuclei-such as weak charge form factors and neutron skin thickness-and the bulk properties of neutron stars, including tidal deformability from binary neutron star mergers and neutron star radii. The dependencies are formulated by introducing a family of $\beta$-equilibrated equations of state based on relativistic energy density functionals with point coupling interactions. The charge minus the weak form factors derived from CREX and PREX-2 measurements, combined with the observational constraints on tidal deformability from the GW170817 event, are used to constrain the symmetry energy and neutron star radii. Notably, the energy density expanded up to the fourth order in symmetry energy yields larger radii compared to calculations limited to the second order term. However, the results reveal a discrepancy between the constraints provided by the CREX and PREX-2 experiments. For a more quantitative assessment, higher precision parity-violating electron scattering data and neutron star observations are required.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with a promising solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes surrounded by axions, then they may allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly enough via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~1 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to be quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a transition state between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of strange mesons.</description>
