      <description>arXiv:2502.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Math is not a spectator sport." "Lecturing is educational malpractice." Slogans like these rally some mathematicians to teach classes that feature "active learning", where lecturing is eschewed for student participation. Yet as much as I believe that students must do math to learn math, I also find blanket statements to be more about bandwagons than considered reflection on teaching. In this column, published in the Fall 2021 AWM Newsletter, I urge us to think through the math we offer students and how we set up students to learn. Although I draw primarily from my experiences teaching proofs in abstract algebra and real analysis, the scenarios extend to other topics in first year undergraduate education and beyond.</description>

      <title>From Euler to AI: Unifying Formulas for Mathematical Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constant $\pi$ has fascinated scholars for centuries, inspiring the derivation of countless formulas rooted in profound mathematical insight. This abundance of formulas raises a question: Are they interconnected, and can a unifying structure explain their relationships?
  We propose a systematic methodology for discovering and proving formula equivalences, leveraging modern large language models, large-scale data processing, and novel mathematical algorithms. Analyzing 457,145 arXiv papers, over a third of the validated formulas for $\pi$ were proven to be derivable from a single mathematical object - including formulas by Euler, Gauss, Lord Brouncker, and newer ones from algorithmic discoveries by the Ramanujan Machine.
  Our approach extends to other constants, such as $e$, $\zeta(3)$, and Catalan's constant, proving its broad applicability. This work represents a step toward the automatic unification of mathematical knowledge, laying a foundation for AI-driven discoveries of connections across scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Archimede, Theon de Smyrne et $\sqrt3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We know that the algorithm of Theon of Smyrna (70-135 AD) made it possible to highlight fine frames of $\sqrt2$ by rationals. However, this same algorithm also applies to $\sqrt3$ and makes it possible to find the famous Archimedes inequalities. An interesting question is whether this very simple iterative method exposed by Theon was not known to the Greeks before him, notably by Archimedes or his contemporaries. Knowing that Theon of Smyrna had already compiled previous works. Note that this algorithm had also made it possible to open a breach towards the Pell-Fermat equations and continued fractions.</description>

      <title>History of Archimedean and non-Archimedean approaches to uniform processes: Uniformity, symmetry, regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Nancy Cartwright's distinction between theories and basic models to explore the history of rival approaches to modeling a notion of chance for an ideal uniform physical process known as a fair spinner. This process admits both Archimedean and non-Archimedean models. Advocates of Archimedean models maintain that the fair spinner should satisfy hypotheses such as invariance with respect to rotations by an arbitrary real angle, and assume that the optimal mathematical tool in this context is the Lebesgue measure. Others argue that invariance with respect to all real rotations does not constitute an essential feature of the underlying physical process, and could be relaxed in favor of regularity. We show that, working in ZFC, no subset of the commonly assumed hypotheses determines a unique model, suggesting that physically based intuitions alone are insufficient to pin down a unique mathematical model. We provide a rebuttal of recent criticisms of non-Archimedean models by Parker and Pruss.</description>

      <title>An introduction to tensors for path signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fit-for-purpose introduction to tensors and their operations. It is envisaged to help the reader become acquainted with its underpinning concepts for the study of path signatures. The text includes exercises, solutions and many intuitive explanations. The material discusses direct sums and tensor products as two possible operations that make the Cartesian product of vectors spaces a vector space. The difference lies in linear Vs. multilinear structures -- the latter being the suitable one to deal with path signatures. The presentation is offered to understand tensors in a deeper sense than just a multidimensional array. The text concludes with the prime example of an algebra in relation to path signatures: the 'tensor algebra'.
  This manuscript is the extended version (with two extra sections) of a chapter to appear in Open Access in a forthcoming Springer volume ``Signatures Methods in Finance: An Introduction with Computational Applications". The two additional sections here discuss the factoring of tensor product expressions to a minimal number of terms. This problem is relevant for the path signatures theory but not necessary for what is presented in the book. Tensor factorization is an elegant way of becoming familiar with the language of tensors and tensor products. A GitHub repository is attached.</description>
