      <title>Phenomenology of dark matter indirect detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present a comprehensive and pedagogical overview of dark matter (DM). Chapter 1 discusses the main evidences for its existence, its properties, and potential candidates. We then explore major detection strategies, with Chapter 2 specifically dedicated to indirect detection. In the following chapters, we study the emission of secondary photons resulting from the interaction between DM products and the Galactic environment. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on DM as sub-GeV particles, analysing how the DM-produced electrons and positrons interact with ambient photons to generate X-rays through inverse Compton scattering. Comparing the predicted spectra with data from X-ray observatories yields strong constraints on sub-GeV DM. Chapter 5 extends these techniques to the case of primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation, imposing significant limits on PBHs as potential DM candidates.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in magnetic dual chiral density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.</description>

      <title>Dark plasmas in the nonlinear regime: constraints from particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the dark sector possesses long-range self-interactions, these interactions can source dramatic collective instabilities even in astrophysical settings where the collisional mean free path is long. Here, we focus on the specific case of dark matter halos composed of a dark $U(1)$ gauge sector undergoing a dissociative cluster merger. We study this by performing the first dedicated particle-in-cell plasma simulations of interacting dark matter streams, tracking the growth, formation, and saturation of instabilities through both the linear and nonlinear regimes. We find that these instabilities give rise to local (dark) electromagnetic inhomogeneities that serve as scattering sites, inducing an effective dynamic collisional cross-section. Mapping this effective cross-section onto existing results from large-scale simulations of the Bullet Cluster, we extend the limit on the dark charge-to-mass ratio by over ten orders of magnitude. Our results serve as a simple example of the rich phenomenology that may arise in a dark sector with long-range interactions and motivate future dedicated study of such ``dark plasmas.''</description>

      <title>Hunting axion dark matter with anti-ferromagnets: a case study with nickel oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that nickel oxide, which is already a very promising target to look for sub-MeV dark matter scattering, can be employed to hunt axion dark matter, with masses in the meV range and couplings to electrons allowing them to potentially be QCD axions. We describe the interactions between axions and the collective excitations of nickel oxide in terms of a universal effective field theory, built solely out of symmetry arguments. The processes of conversion into one or two excitations provide, respectively, a narrowband and a broadband channel for the axion search, and the possibility of varying an external magnetic field up to a phase transition point allows to cover a large portion of a yet unexplored parameter space, reaching axion masses down to few fractions of an meV. Our results underline nickel oxide as an ideal candidate for a multi-purpose target for light dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Boosted Dark Matter Driven by Cosmic Rays and Diffuse Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection of light dark matter can be significantly enhanced by up-scattering of dark matter with energetic particles in the cosmic ambient. This boosted dark matter flux can reach kinetic energies up to tens of MeV, while the typical kinetic energies of GeV mass dark matter particles in the Milky Way halo are of the order of keV. Dark matter boosted by energetic diffuse supernova background neutrinos can be detected only through nuclear or electron scattering in ground-based detectors requiring a non-zero interaction of dark matter with nucleon or electron, in addition to its interaction with neutrino. However, in the presence of dark matter-nucleon (electron) interaction, the scattering of dark matter with cosmic rays is unavoidable. Thus, we consider boosted dark matter resulting from diffuse supernova neutrinos as well as cosmic protons (electrons) considering both energy-dependent and energy-independent scattering cross-sections between dark matter and standard model particles. We explore this scenario in dark matter detectors such as XENONnT and neutrino detectors like Super-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Non-linear dynamics of jet quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive analytic framework for jet quenching in QCD media, based on a medium-induced parton cascade sourced by collinear virtual splittings. We show that the energy flow out of the jet cone, driven by turbulent gluon cascades, is governed by a non-linear rate equation that resums gluon splittings at arbitrary angles and is enhanced by the medium length, $L$. The solution of this equation sets the initial condition for a non-linear DGLAP-like evolution equation, which describes the collinear early vacuum cascade resolved by the medium at angles exceeding the medium resolution angle, $\theta_c$. For asymptotic jet energies, the medium-induced cascade displays an exponential behavior that generalizes the Poisson-like distribution of parton energy loss. This formulation enables the resummation of leading contributions in $\alpha_s \ln (1/R)$, and $\alpha_s \ln (R / \theta_c)$, and powers of $\alpha_s L$. We briefly explore the limit of strong quenching, where analytic treatments are feasible, offering insights into the impact of parton cascades on jet quenching. These results provide guidance for future numerical simulations and analytical investigations.</description>

      <title>Towards a precision determination of the $X(6200)$ parameters from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 126}, 132001 (2021), the LHCb data on the di-$J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions were analysed in a coupled-channel framework based on double-vector-charmonium channels. This investigation identified a robust pole near the $J/\psi J/\psi$ threshold, tagged $X(6200)$, suggesting it as a new state. The present work extends that investigation by incorporating recent di-$J/\psi$ production data from the CMS and ATLAS collaborations and performing a combined analysis of all three data sets. This study confirms the existence of the $X(6200)$, and its pole position is now determined with a higher precision than in the previous study, where only a single data set was employed. The pole corresponding to the $X(6900)$ is also extracted, though its actual position and residue depend on a particular coupled-channel model employed and deviate from values reported in the experimental investigations. The dielectron width of the $X(6200)$ is estimated under different conjectures on its quantum numbers, and the number of such states that can be annually produced at the future Super $\tau$-Charm Facility is estimated. The line shape in the complimentary $J/\psi\psi(2S)$ channel is discussed, and a good agreement with the ATLAS data is found.</description>

      <title>The rare decay $B^+ \to K^+\ell^+\ell^-(\nu\bar{\nu})$ under the QCD sum rules approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we conduct a detailed investigation of the rare decay processes of charged meson, specifically $B^+ \to K^+\ell^+\ell^-$ with $\ell=(e,\mu,\tau)$ and $B^+ \to K^+\nu\bar{\nu}$. These processes involve flavor-changing-neutral-current (FCNC) transitions, namely $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ and $b\to s\nu\bar{\nu}$. The essential components $B\to K$ scalar, vector and tensor transition form factors (TFFs) are calculated by using the QCD light-cone sum rules approach up to next-to-leading order QCD corrections. In which, the kaon twist-2 and twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes are calculated from both the QCD sum rules within the framework of background field theory and the light-cone harmonic oscillator model. The TFFs at large recoil point are $f_+^{BK}(0)=f_0^{BK}(0) =0.328_{-0.028}^{+0.032}$ and $f_{\rm T}^{BK}(0)=0.277_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$, respectively. To achieve the behavior of those TFFs in the whole $q^2$-region, we extrapolate them by utilizing the simplified $z(q^2)$-series expansion. Furthermore, we compute the differential branching fractions with respect to the squared dilepton invariant mass for the two different decay channels and present the corresponding curves. Our predictions of total branching fraction are ${\cal B}(B^+\to K^+ e^+ e^-)=6.633_{-1.070}^{+1.341}\times 10^{-7}$, ${\cal B}(B^+\to K^+ \mu^+ \mu^-)=6.620_{-1.056}^{+1.323}\times 10^{-7}$, ${\cal B}(B^+\to K^+ \tau^+ \tau^-)=1.760_{-0.197}^{+0.241}\times 10^{-7}$, and ${\cal B}(B^+\to K^+ \nu\bar{\nu})=4.135_{-0.655}^{+0.820}\times 10^{-6}$, respectively. Lastly, the observables such as the lepton universality $\mathcal{R}_{K}$ and the angular distribution `flat term' $F_{\rm H}^\ell$ are given, which show good agreement with the theoretical and experimental predictions.</description>

      <title>Fate of $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi_c'$ and $\Omega_c$ baryons at high temperature with chiral restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masses of the singly heavy baryons (SHBs), composed of a heavy quark and a light diquark, are studied from the viewpoints of heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS) and chiral-symmetry restoration at finite temperature. We consider the light diquarks with spin-parity $J^P=0^\pm$ and $1^\pm$. Medium corrections to the SHBs are provided through the diquarks whereas the heavy quark is simply regarded as a spectator. The chiral dynamics of the diquark are described by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model having (pseudo)scalar-type and (axial)vector-type four-point interactions and the six-point ones responsible for the $U(1)_A$ axial anomaly. The divergences are handled by means of the three-dimensional proper-time regularization with both ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs included, in order to eliminate unphysical imaginary parts. As a result, the mass degeneracies between the parity partners of all the SHBs are predicted in accordance with the chiral restoration. In particular, the HQS-doublet SHBs exhibit clear mass degeneracies due to the absence of the direct anomaly effects. We also predict a mass degeneracy of $\Sigma_c$ and $\Omega_c$ above the pseudocritical temperature $T_{\rm pc}$ of chiral restoration, which results in a peculiar mass hierarchy for positive-parity HQS-doublet SHBs where $\Xi_c'$ becomes heavier than $\Omega_c$ Besides, it is found that the decay width of $\Sigma_c\to\Lambda_c\pi$ vanishes above $T_{\rm pc}$ reflecting a closing of the threshold. The predicted modifications of masses and decay widths of the SHBs are expected to provide future heavy-ion collision experiments and lattice simulations with useful information on chiral dynamics of the diquarks.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of hadrons, nuclei, and atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of exotic hadrons have been stimulating the theoretical investigation of the internal structure of hadrons. While all hadrons are eventually composed of quarks and gluons by the strong interaction, clustering phenomena of quarks can generate hadronic molecules -- weakly bound systems of hadrons -- which are expected to emerge near two-hadron thresholds. However, it should be noted that a pure hadronic molecule is not realized, as the strong interaction induces mixing with other possible configurations. The compositeness of hadrons has been developed as a promising concept to quantitatively characterize the fraction of the hadronic molecular component. Here we summarize the modern understanding of the compositeness to study the internal structure of hadrons, and review the applications of the compositeness to various quantum systems in different energy scales, such as nuclei and atomic systems in addition to hadrons.</description>

      <title>The $D^* D \pi$ and $B^* B \pi$ couplings from Dyson-Schwinger equations framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing a unified Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter equations approach, we calculate the strong decay couplings $D^* D \pi$ and $B^* B \pi$ within the so-called impulse-approximation in the moving frame. The $B^* B \pi$ estimation is reported for the first time based on a Poincar\'e invariant computation of the associated Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. Our predictions yield $g_{D^* D \pi}=16.22_{-0.01}^{+0.03}$ and $g_{B^* B \pi}=40.09_{-1.37}^{+1.51}$, along with corresponding static strong couplings of $\hat{g}_D=0.55_{-&lt;0.01}^{+&lt;0.01}$, $\hat{g}_B=0.50_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$. The numerical uncertainties arise from variations in the momentum partitioning parameter. Our results are consistent with recent experimental and lattice data.</description>

      <title>Phase transition analogues in laser collisions with a dark-field setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser pulse collisions are a promising tool for the investigation of light-by-light scattering phenomena induced by quantum vacuum fluctuations. Using the numerical code based on the vacuum emission picture and put forward in Blinne et al. (2019), we observe a strong dependence of the signal features on the transverse profiles of the colliding laser pulses in the interaction region. For a probe beam tailored such as to feature an annular far-field profile and a pronounced on-axis focus peak counterpropagating a pump beam at zero impact parameter, the signal's main emission direction can undergo the analogue of a phase transition with the beam waist ratio of the pulses serving as a control parameter. Depending on the pump's beam profile, this phase transition can be first order (e.g., for a pump with flat top far-field profile) or second order (e.g., for a Gaussian pump). From the simulation data, we determine the critical point and extract the corresponding critical exponent for the second order transition of the main emission direction of the signal in the far field. For this, we improve the performance of the above numerical code, using the phase transition analogues as an example to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of the code and current workflows.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ evolution of dipole amplitude: forward--off-forward correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have shown that the small-$x$ evolution of the off-forward leading-log dipole scattering amplitudes, both pomeron and odderon, in the momentum space can be completely determined by the evolution of the respective forward amplitudes, with rescaled momenta. In position space, if there is translation symmetry (assumption of a large nucleus), the dipole cross section depends on the positions of quarks and anti-quarks only through their separation. The present study is an equivalent proposition in the momentum space -- where translation symmetry in momentum bifurcates the amplitudes into two translationally symmetric functions along the ${\bf k}$ line in the ${\bf k}-{\bf \Delta}$ plane. It also shows that high energy evolutions of dipole GTMDs can be achieved only by studying the evolution of dipole TMDs at small-$x$.</description>

      <title>Quantum state tomography with muons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental pillar of quantum mechanics. Probing quantum entanglement and testing Bell inequality with muons can be a significant leap forward, as muon is arguably the only massive elementary particle that can be manipulated and detected over a wide range of energies, e.g., from approximately 0.3 to $10^2$ GeV, corresponding to velocities from 0.94 to nearly the speed of light. In this work, we present a realistic proposal and a comprehensive study of quantum entanglement in a state composed of different-flavor fermions in muon-electron scattering. The polarization density matrix for the muon-electron system is derived using a kinematic approach within the relativistic quantum field theory framework. Entanglement in the resulting muon-electron qubit system and the violation of Bell inequalities can be observed with a high event rate. This paves the way for performing quantum tomography with muons.</description>

      <title>Nucleon relativistic weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic full weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions inside a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system are systematically studied for the first time, where the second-class current contribution associated with the induced (pseudo-)tensor form factor (FF) is included. For experimental measurements, we explicitly derive the first exact full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections of both (anti)neutrino-nucleon and (anti)neutrino-antinucleon elastic scatterings. We clearly demonstrate that the 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame, being purely imaginary and parity-odd, is in fact related to the induced (pseudo-)tensor FF $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than the axial FF $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving system, and compared them with their light-front counterparts. We clarify the role played by Melosh rotations, and classify the origin of distortions in light-front distributions into three key sources using the lemma that we have proposed and verified in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii. We finally illustrate our results in the case of a proton using the weak-neutral axial-vector FFs extracted from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Associated jet + electroweak gauge boson production in hadronic collisions at forward rapidities in the color-dipole $S$-matrix framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross-section for the associated production of a jet with an electroweak gauge boson ($G = W^{\pm}, Z^0, \gamma$) at forward rapidities in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions is derived within the color - dipole $S$ - matrix framework. We present the full expressions for the differential cross-section of the $q p \rightarrow G q X$ process in the transverse momentum space, considering the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the gauge boson. We demonstrate that the final formulae can be expressed in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution and reproduce previous results for the associated jet + $\gamma$ and jet + $Z^0$ production, derived using other frameworks. Moreover, we derive the back - to - back correlation limit of the spectra and show that it can be expressed in terms of the unpolarized and linearly polarized transverse momentum gluon distributions. Our results improve the description of the inclusive jet plus color neutral particle production at forward rapidities, not far from the proton fragmentation region, in $pp$ or $pA$ collisions, and are the main ingredient to study the impact of nonlinear QCD effects in two - particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Large non-Gaussianities corresponding to first-order phase transitions during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the back reaction of phase transitions in the spectator sector on the inflaton field during slow-roll inflation. Due to the significant excursion of the inflaton field, these phase transitions are likely to occur and can induce substantial non-Gaussian correlations in the curvature perturbation. Our results suggest that these correlations could be detectable by future observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and large-scale structure surveys. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in certain parameter spaces, a scaling non-Gaussian signal can be produced, offering deeper insights into both the inflaton and spectator sectors. Additionally, phase transitions during inflation can generate gravitational wave signals with distinctive signatures, potentially explaining observations made by pulsar timing array experiments. The associated non-Gaussian correlations provide collateral evidence for these phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Improving the solver for the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution equation is an equation derived from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics that allows one to calculate the scattering amplitude of a pair of quark and antiquark off a hadron target, called the dipole amplitude, as a function of the collision energy. The initial condition, being a non-perturbative object, usually has to be modeled separately. Typically, the model contains several tunable parameters that are determined by fitting to experimental data. In this contribution, we propose an implementation of the BK solver using differentiable programming. Automatic differentiation offers the possibility that the first and second derivatives of the amplitude with respect to the initial condition parameters are automatically calculated at all stages of the simulation. This fact should considerably facilitate and speed up the fitting step. Moreover, in the context of Transverse Momentum Dis- tributions (TMD), we demonstrate that automatic differentiation can be used to obtain the first and second derivatives of the amplitude with respect to the quark-antiquark separation. These derivatives can be used to relate various TMD functions to the dipole amplitude. Our C++ code for the solver, which is available in a public repository [1], includes the Balitsky one-loop running coupling prescription and the kinematic constraint. This version of the BK equation is widely used in the small-x evolution framework.</description>

      <title>Super-Leading Logarithms in $pp\to2$ Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet observables at hadron colliders feature ''super-leading'' logarithms, double-logarithmic corrections resulting from a breakdown of color coherence due to complex phases in hard-scattering amplitudes. While these effects only arise in high orders of perturbation theory and are suppressed in the large-$N_c$ limit, they formally constitute leading logarithmic corrections to the cross sections. We present the first analysis of the corresponding contributions to a hadronic cross section, including all partonic channels and interference effects. Interestingly, some interference terms in partonic $q\bar q\to q\bar q$ scattering are only linearly suppressed in $1/N_c$. Our results for the $pp\to 2$ jets gap-between-jets cross section demonstrate the numerical importance of super-leading logarithms for small values of the veto scale $Q_0$, showing that these contributions should be accounted for in precision studies of such observables.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity governs the unification of all known elementary forces necessitates the extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $% SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ defines the degree of the internal $SU(N)$ symmetry as a subgroup. This extension is argued to lead to a consistent hyperunification scheme provided that the tetrad fields of $SL(2,C)$ gravity retain their form in the extended theory, thereby preserving the invertibility conditions, which would otherwise be lost. Consequently, while the entire gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ normally includes vector, axial-vector and tensor field submultiplets of the internal $SU(N)$ symmetry, only the submultiplet of vector fields and the singlet tensor field emerge in the observed particle spectrum. The submultiplet of axial-vector fields appear sterile to ordinary matter, while the submultiplet of tensor fields acquires the Planck scale order masses. As a consequence, the entire theory only exhibits the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$ symmetry, comprising $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity on one hand and $SU(N)$ grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in the $% SL(2N,C)$ theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potential $SU(N)$ GUTs, including the conventional $SU(5)$ theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin $1/2$ quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying the $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations identifies $SL(16,C)$ with the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry, accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.</description>

      <title>High-energy interactions of charged black holes in full general relativity I: Zoom-whirl orbits and universality with the irreducible mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate high-energy scattering of equal-mass, nonspinning black holes endowed with like charges in full general relativity while varying the impact parameter $b$. We show that electrodynamics does not suppress zoom-whirl orbits for at least charge-to-mass ratios $\lambda = 0.1, 0.4, 0.6$. However, we find that as $\lambda$ increases, the immediate merger and scattering thresholds defining the zoom-whirl regime move to smaller impact parameter $b/M_{\rm ADM}$, with $M_{\rm ADM}$ designating the binary black hole gravitational mass. This demonstrates that charge leaves observable imprints in key properties at energy scales where charge has negligible influence in head-on collisions. Additionally, we find that these threshold impact parameters become universal, i.e., charge-independent, when we normalize $b$ by the sum of the initial BH irreducible masses in the binary ($b/M_{\rm irr}$). This is the first explicit demonstration that the irreducible mass, which is proportional to the black hole areal radius, defines a fundamental gauge-invariant length scale governing horizon scale scattering events in the strong-field, dynamical spacetime regime.</description>

      <title>Non-local effective field theory in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities under certain conditions. Namely, the post-Newtonian approximation might break down for wide extended bodies with angular momentum, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity is needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effetcs, with significant consequences for gravitational physics and cosmology at large.</description>

      <title>Quantum van der Waals quarkyonic matter at non-zero isospin asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed quantum van der Waals quarkyonic matter to non-zero isospin asymmetries by utilizing the two-component van der Waals equation with a generalized excluded volume prescription. The isospin dependence of van der Waals interaction parameters is determined by constraints on the symmetry energy, slope of the symmetry energy, and nuclear ground state properties. We find that the speed of sound has a peak for all values of the asymmetry parameter, signifying a transition to quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic matter onset density is found to have a mild dependence on isospin asymmetry, with specific details influenced by the isospin dependence of the repulsive interactions. We also incorporate leptonic degrees of freedom and explore the neutron star matter equation of state, calculating mass-radius relations and tidal properties of neutron stars. We find that quarkyonic matter supports heavy neutron stars with a maximum mass of at least 2.6 solar masses. We observe quantitatively different behavior for the excluded volume cases of isospin-blind ($b_{n}=b_{pn}$) and isospin-dependent ($b_{n} \neq b_{pn}$) repulsion, the latter being preferred by observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the equation of state of strange quark star: Perturbative QCD along with a density-dependent bag constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) using a Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) perturbative model combined with the latest Particle Data Group dataset. Given the energy scale present in compact stars, QCD perturbation theory alone may not fully explain their structure. To account for non-perturbative contributions, we incorporate a density-dependent effective bag parameter, $B$, and derive the equation of state (EOS) for strange quark matter (SQM). We start by demonstrating the limitations of EOSs with a constant $B$ in describing massive objects with $ M_{TOV}&gt; 2M_{\odot} $. Subsequently, we show that considering $B$ as a density-dependent function significantly changes the results. Our definition of $B$ includes two parameters determined by both theoretical and observational constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating a density-dependent $B$ into the perturbative EOS can yield SQSs with masses exceeding $2M_{\odot}$, while complying with gravitational wave constraints such as tidal deformability, and thermodynamic considerations, including stability conditions and speed of sound behavior. Specifically, we show that massive compact objects like PSR J0952-0607, PSR J2215+5135, PSR J0740+6620, and the secondary mass of GW190814 can be SQSs. Additionally, we compare our EOS with the EOS of the authors who use a generalized polytropic form with adjustable parameters and obtain an interesting result.</description>

      <title>Charmonia Production in Hot QCD Matter and Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both hot QCD matter and extremely strong electromagnetic fields are generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We employ the transport model and the equivalent photon approximation (EPA) to study charmonium hadroproduction and photoproduction in nucleus-nucleus collisions, respectively. In photoproduction, quasi-real photons may interact with the whole nucleus or individual nucleons, which is called the coherent and incoherent processes, respectively. The typical momentum of charmonium produced in two processes is located in $p_T\lesssim 1/R_A$ and $p_T\lesssim 1/R_N$, where $R_A$ and $R_N$ are the radii of nucleus and the nucleon. Both kinds of photoproduction and also hadroproduction are considered to calculate charmonium production in different transverse momentum bins, rapidity bins, and collision centralities, incorporating modifications from hot QCD matter and initial cold nuclear matter effects. Our calculations explain experimental data about charmonium nuclear modification factors and the production cross-section in ultra-peripheral collisions. Charmonium nuclear modification is far above the unit at extremely low $p_T$ ($p_T &lt; 0.1$ GeV/c) in peripheral collisions with centrality 70-90\%, attributed to coherent photoproduction.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\psi$ photo-production on nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental developments, the Pom-CQM model of the $\gamma + N \to J/\psi + N$ reaction of Lee et al. [Eur. Phys. J. A. 58, 252 (2022)] and Sakinah et al. [Phys. Rev. C. 109, 065204 (2024)] has been applied to predict the exclusive $J/\psi$ photo-production on nuclei ($A$). Within the multiple scattering theory, the calculations have been performed by including the impulse amplitude $T^{\rm IMP}_{J/\psi A,\gamma A}$ and the $J/\psi$-nucleus final state interaction (FSI) amplitude $T^{\rm FSI}_{J/\psi A,\gamma A}$. For the deuteron target, $T^{\rm IMP}_{J/\psi d,\gamma d}$ is calculated exactly using the wave function generated from the realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. It is found that, near the threshold region, the $J/\psi$ photo-production cross sections depend sensitively on the $d$-state of the deuteron wave function. The FSI amplitude $T^{\rm FSI}_{J/\psi A,\gamma A}$ is calculated using the first-order optical potential constructed from the $J/\psi$-$N$ scattering amplitude generated from the employed Pom-CQM model. It turns out that the FSI has significant effects in the large momentum-transfer region. By using the conventional fixed scatter approximation (FSA) and the nuclear form factors from the variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) calculations of Lonardoni et al. [Phys. Rev.C. 96, 024326 (2017)], the cross sections of the $J/\psi$ photo-production on ${^4\rm He}$, ${^{16}\rm O}$, and ${^{40}\rm Ca}$ are also predicted for future experimental investigations at JLab and EIC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using PREM as a reference model for the Earth density distribution we investigate the sensitivity of Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) detector to deviations of the Earth i) core average density $\bar{\rho}_C$, ii) lower mantle average density $\bar{\rho}_{lman}$) and iii) upper mantle average density $\bar{\rho}_{uman}$, from their respective PREM densities. The analysis is performed by studying the effects of the Earth matter on the oscillations of atmospheric $\nu_{\mu}$, $\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$. We implement the constraints on the variations of $\rho_C$, $\rho_{lman}$ and $\rho_{uman}$ following from the precise knowledge of the Earth mass $M_\oplus$ and moment of inertia $I_\oplus$, as well as from the requirement that the Earth be in hydrostatic equilibrium (EHE). These constraints limit in the case of the three layer Earth density structure we are considering the maximal positive deviation of $\bar{\rho}_C$ from its PREM value to $10\%$. Considering the case of normal ordering (NO) of neutrino masses, we present results which illustrate the dependence of sensitivity to the core, lower and upper mantle average densities on the energy and zenith angle resolutions, on whether or not the prospective systematic errors are accounted for and on the value of $\theta_{23}$. We show, that in the ``nominal'' case of neutrino energy resolution $E_{res} = 30\%$ and zenith angle resolution $\theta_{zres} = 20^\circ$ and for, $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.45~(0.58)$, HK can determine the average core density $\bar{\rho}_C$ at $2\sigma$ C.L. after 6500 days of operation with an uncertainty of (-14.5\%)/+39.5\% ((-9.3\%/+31.7\%). In the ``more favorable'' case of $E_{res}= 20\%$ and $\theta_{zres} = 10^\circ$, and if $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.58~(0.45)$, the core density would be determined at $2\sigma$ C.L. with an uncertainty of (-8.3\%)/+9.8\% ((-9.2\%)/+11.3\%).</description>

      <title>Can We Detect Deviations from Einstein's Gravity in Black Hole Ringdowns?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of gravitational waves emitted during the black hole ringdown relaxation phase, following the merger of a black hole binary, is a crucial target of gravitational wave astronomy. By considering causality constraints on the on-shell graviton three-point couplings within a weakly coupled gravity theory, we present arguments indicating that the contributions to the physics of linear and quadratic quasinormal modes from higher derivative gravity theories are either negligible or vastly suppressed for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. Their spectrum and interactions are dictated solely by Einstein's gravity.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Precise study of triply charmed baryons ($\Omega_{ccc}$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the most precise results for the ground state mass of the triply-charmed spin-$3/2$ baryon using lattice quantum chromodynamics. The calculations are performed on six $N_f=2+1+1$ Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) lattice ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration. Two different lattice setups are employed: in the first one, a fully dynamical calculation with HISQ action is performed, while in the second calculation, an overlap action is utilized for the valence charm quark dynamics. Following the continuum extrapolation of our results, obtained at five different lattice spacings, two different volumes, and two different actions, our prediction for the mass of the lowest triply charmed spin-3/2 baryon, $\Omega_{ccc} (3/2^{+})$, is $4793 (5) (7)$ MeV. This is the most precise determination to date, fully addressing the systematic uncertainties. We also predict the $\Omega_{ccc} (3/2^{-})$ mass to be $5094 (12) (13)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Two loop QCD corrections for the process Pseudo-scalar Higgs $\rightarrow 3$ partons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.02387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present virtual contributions up to two loop level in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) to the decay of pseudo-scalar Higgs boson ($A$) to three gluons ($g$) and also to quark ($q$), anti-quark ($\overline q$) and a gluon. With appropriate crossing, they are well suited for predicting the differential distribution of $A$ in association with a jet in hadron colliders up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in strong coupling constant and also for the subsequent decay of $A$ to hadrons. We use effective field theory approach to integrate out the top quarks in the heavy top limit. The resulting theory involves two pseudo-scalar composite operators describing the interaction of $A$ with gluons as well as with quark and anti-quark. We perform our computation in dimensional regularisation and use minimal subtraction ($\overline{MS}$) scheme to renormalise strong coupling constant as well as the composite operators. The ultraviolet (UV) finite amplitudes contain infrared (IR) divergences that are found to be in agreement with the predictions by Catani. For both the amplitudes namely $A \rightarrow g g g$ and $A \rightarrow q \overline q g$, the leading transcendental terms at one and two loops are found to be identical to those in a three point form factor (FF) of the half-BPS operator in ${\cal N}=4$ Supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) theory when the QCD color factors are adjusted in a specific way. We present our results in terms of harmonic polylogs well suited for further numerical study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotations of an axion field in field space provide a natural origin for an era of kination domination, where the energy density is dominated by the kinetic term of the axion field, preceded by an early era of matter domination. Remarkably, no entropy is produced at the end of matter domination and hence these eras of matter and kination domination may occur even after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We derive constraints on these eras from both the cosmic microwave background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We investigate how this cosmological scenario affects the spectrum of possible primordial gravitational waves and find that the spectrum features a triangular peak. We discuss how future observations of gravitational waves can probe the viable parameter space, including regions that produce axion dark matter by the kinetic misalignment mechanism or the baryon asymmetry by axiogenesis. For QCD axion dark matter produced by the kinetic misalignment mechanism, a modification to the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum occurs above 0.01 Hz and, for high values of the energy scale of inflation, the prospects for discovery are good. We briefly comment on implications for structure formation of the universe.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from bubble collisions during a first-order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.04271v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of production of primordial black holes (PBHs) from bubble collisions during a first-order phase transition. While typical colliding bubbles are small and irrelevant for PBH production, we find that those that can produce PBHs must have a macroscopically thick fluid shell and have been born much before the typical nucleation time. Particularly large uncertainties arise from an exponential sensitivity of the nucleation rate on the required duration of bubble growth which depends on the details of the collisions and the evolution of the spacetime metric toward the end of the phase transition. We introduce a few parameters to be obtained from future numerical simulation to represent those unknowns, and estimate the PBH abundance in an Abelian Higgs benchmark model and show that it can be significant. We predict an approximately monochromatic PBH mass spectrum, and find regions in the parameter space where the PBHs can constitute entire dark matter or even over-close the universe. Our result thus shows that models with a first-order phase transition can be constrained by over-abundant PBHs or null results of other PBH searches.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two diffusion models and an autoregressive transformer for LHC physics simulations. Bayesian versions allow us to control the networks and capture training uncertainties. After illustrating their different density estimation methods for simple toy models, we discuss their advantages for Z plus jets event generation. While diffusion networks excel through their precision, the transformer scales best with the phase space dimensionality. Given the different training and evaluation speed, we expect LHC physics to benefit from dedicated use cases for normalizing flows, diffusion models, and autoregressive transformers.</description>

      <title>Angularity in Higgs boson decays via $\boldsymbol{H\to gg}$ at NNLL$'$ accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present improved predictions of a class of event-shape distributions called angularity for a contribution from an effective operator $H\to gg$ in Higgs hadronic decay that suffers from large perturbative uncertainties. In the frame of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, logarithmic terms of the distribution are resummed at NNLL$'$ accuracy, for which 2-loop constant of gluon-jet function for angularity is independently determined by a fit to fixed-order distribution at NLO corresponding to ${\mathcal{O}}(\alpha_s^2)$ relative to the Born rate. Our determination shows reasonable agreement with the value in a thesis recently released. In the fit, we use an asymptotic form with a fractional power conjectured from recoil corrections at one-loop order and it improves the accuracy of determination in positive values of angularity parameter $a$. The resummed distribution is matched to the NLO fixed-order results to make our predictions valid at all angularity values. We also discuss the first moment and subtracted moment of angularity as a function of $a$ that allow to extract information on leading and subleading nonperturbative corrections associated with gluons.</description>

      <title>Baryon Asymmetry from the Decay and Scattering of a Majorana Fermion Pair Coupled to Quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the baryon asymmetry in decay and scattering processes involving the electromagnetically charge-neutral fermion $\chi$ that carries nonzero baryon number and interacts with quark-like fermions $U,D$ via a vector-vector dimension-six effective operator, in the theory we developed in our earlier work. Majorana masses for the $\chi$ break baryon number and split the Dirac fermion $\chi$ into a pair of Majorana fermions $X_n$ with indefinite baryon number. We identify loop amplitudes for $X_n$ decay and scattering processes that are sensitive to the baryon number violation. The phases in the Majorana mass and couplings, in conjunction with the phase from intermediate onshell states, lead to $C$ and $CP$ violation in these processes. For some representative parameter choices, we numerically compute the decay and scattering baryon asymmetries between the process and its conjugate process, and find that the asymmetry generated is very interesting for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel leptogenesis mechanism with a temperature-dependent coupling between the right-handed neutrino and Standard Model particles. This coupling experiences suppression at high temperatures and becomes sizable when the lepton asymmetry washout processes are Boltzmann-suppressed. Such a feature ensures that the washout rates remain consistently below the Hubble expansion rate, preserving all lepton asymmetry generated in the decay of right-handed neutrinos. We illustrate the feasibility of this mechanism with two example models and show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be successfully obtained for right-handed neutrino masses larger than $10^9~{\rm GeV}$ as well as for smaller violation of charge-parity symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates in detail the performance and advantages of a new quantum Monte Carlo integrator, dubbed Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), to numerically evaluate for the first time loop Feynman integrals in a near-term quantum computer and a quantum simulator. In order to achieve a quadratic speedup, QFIAE introduces a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) that efficiently decomposes the multidimensional integrand into its Fourier series. For a one-loop tadpole Feynman diagram, we have successfully implemented the quantum algorithm on a real quantum computer and obtained a reasonable agreement with the analytical values. One-loop Feynman diagrams with more external legs have been analyzed in a quantum simulator. These results thoroughly illustrate how our quantum algorithm effectively estimates loop Feynman integrals and the method employed could also find applications in other fields such as finance, artificial intelligence, or other physical sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super Rosenbluth experiments, elastic electron-proton scattering experiments that eschew traditional electron detection and opt instead for the detection of the recoiling proton, have several experimental advantages. One claimed advantage is that radiative corrections are more favorable, i.e., smaller and with less kinematic dependence. In this paper, we explore this claim by conducting Monte Carlo simulations of both Super Rosenbluth and traditional Rosenbluth experiments with different models of radiative effects. When using a model that employs the peaking approximation, we indeed confirm the reduced kinematic dependence of the radiative corrections. However, we find that more sophisticated models that avoid the peaking approximation are unable to produce numerically stable results, due to a large enhancement to the cross section for bremsstrahlung radiation from the proton when the momentum transfer, $Q^2$, approaches zero. Since this enhancement is not modelled in the peaking approximation, a more robust approach to radiative corrections in Super Rosenbluth experiments is needed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of $V_{ud}$ determinations from superallowed $\beta$ decays critically hinges on control over radiative corrections. Recently, substantial progress has been made on the single-nucleon, universal corrections, while nucleus-dependent effects, typically parameterized by a quantity $\delta_\text{NS}$, are much less well constrained. Here, we lay out a program to evaluate this correction from effective field theory (EFT), highlighting the dominant terms as predicted by the EFT power counting. Moreover, we compare the results to a dispersive representation of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and show that the expected momentum scaling applies even in the case of low-lying intermediate states. Our EFT framework paves the way towards ab-initio calculations of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and thereby addresses the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$.</description>

      <title>Factorization of photon induced processes in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate photon-photon scattering in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs). We start by deriving an effective Lagrangian from first principles and then apply factorization techniques from Soft-Collinear effective theory (SCET). This approach allows us to decompose the photon-photon scattering cross-section into two primary factors: the generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) and the hard scattering amplitude. We further analyze the emission of soft photons by final state leptons, incorporating a soft function into the cross section through an evolution method. Our analysis yields detailed predictions for observable angular correlations among the final state leptons. Specifically, we calculate the angular correlations characterized by the azimuthal parameters $\langle\cos 2\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 4\phi\rangle$, highlighting the influence of initial photons polarization and recoil effects from final state soft photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the production and polarization of direct $J/\psi$ in the improved color evaporation model in $e+p$ photoproduction. We present the production as functions of transverse momentun, mass of the hadronic final state, and inelasticity. We also present the polarization parameters $\lambda_\vartheta$, $\lambda_{\varphi}$, and $\lambda_{\vartheta \varphi}$ in the helicity and the Collins-Soper frames, as well as the frame-invariant polarization parameter $\tilde{\lambda}$ as a function of transverse momentum and inelasticity. We find agreement with both $J/\psi$ unpolarized cross sections and the invariant polarization parameters as a function of $p_T$.</description>

      <title>New insights into axion freeze-in</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Freeze-in via the axion-photon coupling, $g_{\phi\gamma}$, can produce axions in the early Universe. At low reheating temperatures close to the minimum allowed value $T_{\rm reh}\approx T_{\rm BBN}\approx 10\,{\rm MeV}$, the abundance peaks for axion masses $m_\phi\approx T_{\rm reh}$. Such heavy axions are unstable and subsequently decay, leading to strong constraints on $g_{\phi\gamma}$ from astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we revisit the computation of the freeze-in abundance and clarify important issues. We begin with a complete computation of the collision terms for the Primakoff process, electron-positron annihilation, and photon-to-axion (inverse-)decay, while approximately taking into account plasma screening and threshold effects. We then solve the Boltzmann equation for the full axion distribution function. We confirm previous results about the importance of both processes to the effective "relic abundance" (defined as density prior to decay), and provide useful fitting formulae to estimate the freeze-in abundance from the equilibrium interaction rate. For the distribution function, we find an out-of-equilibrium population of axions and introduce an effective temperature for them. We follow the evolution right up until decay, and find that the average axion kinetic energy is larger than a thermal relic by between 20\% and 80\%, which may have implications for limits on decaying axions from X-ray spectra. We extend our study to a two-axion system with quartic cross-coupling, and find that for typical/expected couplings, freeze-in of a second axion flavour by annihilations leads to a negligibly small contribution to the relic density.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations originate from virtual excitation of Z bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To account for neutrino oscillations, it was postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, for a neutrino produced by the decay of an unstable particle, these mass eigenstates, if they exist, would be entangled with distinct joint momentum eigenstates of the entire system, composed of all the particles produced by the decay. This entanglement destroys the quantum coherence among the neutrino's mass eigenstates, which is responsible for flavor oscillations under the aforementioned postulation. I reveal that the neutrino oscillations actually originate from virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.</description>

      <title>Scheme-independent determination of the QCD running coupling at all scales from jet observables using the Principle of Maximum Conformality/Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to determining the strong coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$, over the entire range of validity of perturbative QCD, for scales above $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ and up to the Planck scale $\sim1.22\cdot10^{19}$\,GeV, with the highest precision and using the data of a single experiment. In particular, we use the results obtained for the thrust ($T$) and $C$-parameter ($C$) distributions in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at a single annihilation energy $\sqrt{s}=M_Z$ (i.e.\ at the $Z^0$ peak). This new method is based on the \emph{intrinsic conformality} (iCF) and on the Infinite-Order Scale Setting, using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (i.e.\ the PMC$_\infty$), which allows a rigorous determination of the renormalization scales for the event-shape variable distributions satisfying all of the requirements of Renormalization Group Invariance, including renormalization-scheme independence and consistency with Abelian theory in the $N_C \to 0$ limit. This new method is based on the scale-invariance of the iCF, which allows determination of $\alpha_s(\mu_0)$ at any scale $\mu_0$, and on the Maximum Likelihood statistical approach. We introduce a novel approach to determining the best-fitting range based on the most-likely-lowest $\chi^2$ calculated considering all possible intervals among the entire range of bins available in the perturbative region. This new method improves the precision and leads to results that are statistically more reliable. In particular, we obtain the following results for the running coupling: $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1170^{+0.0012}_{-0.0010}$ from thrust and $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1181^{+0.0013}_{-0.0009}$ for $C$-parameter in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at NNLO...</description>

      <title>Axion signals from neutron star populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a powerful probe of axion dark matter, especially in higher frequency ranges where there remain fewer laboratory constraints. Populations of neutron stars near the Galactic Centre have been proposed as a means to place strong constraints on axion dark matter. One downside of this approach is that there are very few direct observations of neutron stars in this region, introducing uncertainties in the total number of neutron stars in this ``invisible" population at the Galactic Centre, whose size must be inferred through birth rate modelling. We suggest this number could also be reduced due to stellar dynamics carrying stars away from the Galactic Centre via large kick velocities at birth. We attempt to circumvent the uncertainty on the Galactic Centre population size by modelling the axion signal from better understood populations outside the Galactic Centre using {\tt PsrPopPy} which is normalised against pulsar observations. We consider lower-frequency, wider-angle searches for this signal via a range of instruments including MeerKAT and SKA-low but find that the sensitivity is not competitive with existing constraints. Finally, returning to the Galactic Centre, we compare populations to single objects as targets for axion detection. Using the latest modelling of axion-photon conversion in the Galactic Centre magnetar, we conclude that within astrophysical uncertainties, the Galactic Centre population and the magnetar could give comparable sensitivities to axion dark matter, suggesting one should continue to search for both signals in future surveys.</description>

Abstract: Differentiable programming opens exciting new avenues in particle physics, also affecting future event generators. These new techniques boost the performance of current and planned MadGraph implementations. Combining phase-space mappings with a set of very small learnable flow elements, MadNIS-Lite, can improve the sampling efficiency while being physically interpretable. This defines a third sampling strategy, complementing VEGAS and the full MadNIS.</description>

Abstract: To explore how rigid rotation affects the thermodynamic properties of free relativistic bosons, we employ the standard imaginary time formalism of thermal field theory to calculate the free propagator of complex scalar fields under rotation. We introduce the corresponding partition function and explicitly compute it by expanding the modes in cylindrical coordinates. The resulting propagator is in full agreement with similar findings in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Effect of the scalar unparticle and polarization at muon colliders through the exclusive W boson hadronic decays in the Randall-Sundrum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by using Feynman diagram techniques we have evaluated the effect of the scalar unparticle and polarization at the muon colliders through the exclusive W boson hadronic decays $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \pi^{\pm}\gamma$, $W^{\pm} \rightarrow K^{\pm}\gamma$, $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \rho^{\pm}\gamma$ in the Randall-Sundrum model. The results show that with fixed collision energies, the total cross-sections for hadronic productions in final states depend strongly on the parameters of the unparticle physics and muon beam polarization. The total cross-sections achieve the maximum value when both of muon beams polarize left or right and the minimum value when the $\mu^{-}$ beam polarizes left, the $\mu^{+}$ beam polarizes right and vice versa. In case of the different polarization, the cross-sections increase as the collision energy increases and they change insignificantly when the $\mu^{-}$ beam polarizes left, the $\mu^{+}$ beam polarizes right. With the benchmark background $(\Lambda_{U}, d_{U})$ $= (1 $TeV$, 1.9)$, the cross-sections reach the maximum value. The integrated luminosity value is shown to correspond to a significance larger than $5\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Power corrections to quasi-distribution amplitudes of a heavy meson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13486v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently demonstrated that lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) for a heavy meson, defined in the heavy quark limit, can be extracted by simulating quasi-distribution amplitudes on the lattice with a large meson momentum $P^z$. This extraction involves a two-step procedure. In the first-step, the quasi-distribution amplitudes are matched onto the QCD LCDAs in the large $P^z$ limit. In the second step, the QCD LCDAs are matched onto the desired LCDAs defined in HQET. In this work, we present the $m_H^{2n}/(P^z)^{2n}$ and $\Lambda_\text{QCD}^2/(P^z)^2$ corrections in the first step with $m_H$ being the heavy meson mass. To account for $m_H^{2n}/(P^z)^{2n}$ corrections, we employ two methods: the moment relation that can provide mass corrections to all orders, and a leading-twist projector that gives the leading-order mass corrections. For the $\Lambda_\text{QCD}^2/(P^z)^2$ corrections, we employ a renormalon model that addresses the renormalon ambiguity stemming from the divergence of the perturbative series. We adopt two parametrizations for QCD LCDAs to conduct a numerical analysis. The results suggest that these corrections are typically smaller than 20\% in most regions, and should be included in a precision analysis. These findings will serve as a valuable guide for future studies on heavy meson LCDAs, particularly in the context of Lattice QCD, where accounting for such corrections is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the Yukawa coupling constant of a possible newly discovered top quark is predicted. For this purpose, this paper considers a pseudo scalar mediating top quarks. This new Yukawa coupling is used as a channel to decay into a top quark pair (toponium). For predicting the Yukawa coupling constant, the multicritical-point principle (MPP) is used to determine the effective potential. And a few remarks will be made on the non-perturbative effects of toponium. As a result, the coupling constant of a possible newly discovered top quark pair is predicted to be about $0.85$--$0.86$. The pseudo scalar field is also found to improve the vacuum stability associated with the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on color-superconducting phases in compact stars within the RG-consistent NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine parameters of the renormalization group-consistent three-flavor color-superconducting Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that are suited to investigate possible compact-star configurations. Our goal is to provide quark-matter equations of state (EoS) that can be used for hadron-quark hybrid-star constructions. To that end, we mainly focus on the parameters of the quark-matter model. By varying the vector and diquark coupling constants, we analyze their impact on the EoS, the speed of sound, the maximum diquark gap, and the mass-radius relation. In almost all configurations, a stable color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase appears in the core of the maximum-mass configurations, typically spanning several kilometers in radius. In other cases, the star's two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) branch of the EoS becomes unstable before reaching the CFL transition density. At neutron-star densities, the speed of sound squared reaches up to $c_s^2 \sim 0.6$ and the CFL gap up to $\Delta\sim250\,$MeV. We argue that adding a hadronic EoS at lower densities by performing a Maxwell construction does not increase the maximum mass substantially. Thus we use the $2.0 M_{\odot}$ constraint to constrain the NJL model parameters that are suited for the construction of hybrid-star EoS. We construct three examples of the hybrid-star model, demonstrating that there is room for different color-superconducting compositions. The hybrid EoSs obtained in this way can have no 2SC matter or different ratios of 2SC and CFL quark matter in the core. We show that early hadron-quark transitions are possible that can modify the tidal deformability at 1.4 $M_\odot$. We find that these EoSs are consistent with the imposed constraints from astrophysics and perturbative QCD. They allow for different hybrid-star scenarios with a hadronic EoS that is soft at low to intermediate densities ($\sim 1-3\, n_{\text{sat}}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, nontrivial analytic structure of the quark propagator is discussed for $B$-meson inclusive decays. Attributed to invalidity of the standard K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehman spectral representation, complex conjugate poles alter the evaluation of decay rates, which lead to violation of quark-hadron duality. As phenomenological observables, widths in $B\to X_c\ell\bar{\nu}$ decay as well as lifetime of $B_d^0$ meson are discussed. In the presence of the mentioned nonanalytical contributions, the possibility for resolving the $|V_{cb}|$ puzzle is addressed. It is demonstrated that there exists a parameter region which explains $|V_{cb}|$ and $B_d^0$-meson lifetime simultaneously within 1$\sigma$ via the complex conjugate poles from charm quark.</description>

Abstract: We analytically calculate one- and two-loop helicity amplitudes in massless QED, by adopting a four-dimensional tensor decomposition. We draw our attention to four-fermion and Compton scattering processes to higher orders in the dimensional regulator, as required for theoretical predictions at N$^3$LO. We organise loop amplitudes by proposing an efficient algorithm at integrand level to group Feynman graphs into integral families. We study the singular structure of these amplitudes and discuss the correspondence between QED and QCD processes. We present our results in terms of generalised polylogarithms up to transcendental weight six.</description>

Abstract: We study potential contribution of the heavy right-handed neutrino exchange in the process $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$. This process is sensitive to heavy neutrinos with masses larger than $\sqrt{s}$. The Monte Carlo simulation of the studied process is performed assuming the Seesaw type-I model, where heavy right-handed neutrinos (heavy neutral leptons, HNL) are introduced in the leptonic sector. Within the Standard Model (SM), the process has a large cross section described by diagrams with $s$-channel $Z / \gamma$ exchange and $t$-channel active neutrino exchange. Respectively, the $t$-channel right-handed neutrino exchange amplitude will interfere with these SM amplitudes. However, the angular distributions of the $W$ boson production and decay are different for the right-handed neutrino and SM amplitudes. That can be used to evaluate potential HNL contribution using the extended likelihood method. The simulation of the $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$ process is performed at the 1 TeV center-of-mass energy and polarisation $P_{e^+e^-}$ of (20 %, -80 %), which is a standard option for the future linear $e^+e^-$ collider ILC. Both $W$ bosons are reconstructed from two hadronic jets. Simulation of the SM background processes is also done. The beam-induced backgrounds and the initial state radiation (ISR) effects are taken into account. The majority of background processes are effectively suppressed by the cuts on the invariant masses of two and four jets. Finally, we obtain upper limits on the mixing parameter $|V_{eN}|^2$ as a function of $M(N)$.</description>

      <title>Copositive criteria for a two-component dark matter model</title>

Abstract: We consider a two-component scalar dark matter model in this work, where the scalars are stabilized by extra $Z_2 \times Z'_2$ symmetry. To guarantee the stability of the vacuum, we consider the copositive criteria and different choices of the signs of the couplings will contribute to different viable parameter spaces. Based on the copositive criteria, we systematically analyze the possible conditions and pick up 17 different cases with fixing some parameters to be negative. We randomly scan the parameter space under dark matter relic density constraint and direct detection constraint and focus on the quartic couplings with $\lambda_{13}$,$\lambda_{23}$,$\lambda_{14}$ and $\lambda_{24}$. The shapes of the viable parameter space for $|\lambda_{14}|-|\lambda_{24}|$ are almost similar among these cases, while for $|\lambda_{13}|$ and $|\lambda_{23}|$, the larger value are excluded as long as $\lambda_{13}\leqslant 0$ and $\lambda_{23}\leqslant 0$ due to the large interference effect of the $2 \to 2$ processes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Higgs Boson Reconstruction Efficiency with Small-R (R = 0.4) and Large-R (R = 1.0) Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11949v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Beyond the Standard Model searches at ATLAS employ jets to simplify event reconstruction. These jets cluster particle shower products into calculable objects, which are then used to obtain information about parent particles. Large-R (R = 1.0) jets combine these products into one jet that spans 2 radians, while small-R (R = 0.4) jets are used to further refine individual b-quark trajectories. Optimizing the use of jets is crucial for making precision measurements of Higgs bosons with high transverse momenta, and this paper uses b-quarks produced in the Wino chargino LSP decay to identify parameters that best do so. Monte Carlo simulation found that parameters such as the distance between Higgs bosons and the distance between b-jets were relevant in selecting the most accurate small-R reconstructions. Truth data analysis corroborated the paper's findings, especially for charginos with higher mass. These parameters were then used to refine small-R jet selection, increasing reconstruction efficiency across chargino masses. Further analysis into large-R jet selection would enhance these results, especially at higher chargino masses. A neural network would also prove useful for exploring the effects of combinations of parameters across chargino masses.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Scalar Field Dynamics with DESI 2024 Y1 BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quintessence scalar fields are a natural candidate for evolving dark energy. Unlike the phenomenological $w_0w_a$ parameterization of the dark energy equation of state, they cannot accommodate the phantom regime of dark energy $w(z) &lt; -1$, or crossings into the phantom regime. Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant, ranging from $2.6\sigma-3.9\sigma$ when fitting to $w_0w_a$, and combining the DESI BAO measurements with other cosmological probes. In this work, we directly fit three simple scalar field models to the DESI BAO data, combined with cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements and supernova data sets. We find the best fit model to include a $2-4\%$ kinetic scalar field energy $\Omega_{\rm scf,k}$, for a canonical scalar field with a quadratic or linear potential. However, only the DESY-Y5 supernova data set combination shows a preference for quintessence over $\Lambda$CDM at the $95\%$ confidence level. Fitting to the supernova data sets Pantheon, Pantheon+, DES-Y5, and Union3, we show that the mild tension ($n_{\sigma}&lt; 3.4 $) under $\Lambda$CDM emerges from a BAO preference for smaller values of fractional mass-energy density $\Omega_m &lt; 0.29$, while all supernova data sets, except for Pantheon, prefer larger values, $\Omega_m &gt; 0.3$. The tension under $\Lambda$CDM remains noticeable ($n_{\sigma} &lt;2.8$), when replacing two of the DESI BAO redshift bins with effective redshifts $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.706$ with comparable BOSS DR 12 BAO measurements at $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.61$. Canonical scalar fields as dark energy are successful in mitigating that tension.</description>

      <title>A search for an eV-scale sterile neutrino using improved high-energy $\nu_\mu$ event reconstruction in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter presents the result of a 3+1 sterile neutrino search using 10.7 years of IceCube data. We analyze atmospheric muon neutrinos that traverse the Earth with energies ranging from 0.5 to 100 TeV, incorporating significant improvements in modeling neutrino flux and detector response compared to earlier studies. Notably, for the first time, we categorize data into starting and through-going events, distinguishing neutrino interactions with vertices inside or outside the instrumented volume, to improve energy resolution. The best-fit point for a 3+1 model is found to be at $\sin^2(2\theta_{24}) = 0.16$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{41} = 3.5$ eV$^2$, which agrees with previous iterations of this study. The result is consistent with the null hypothesis of no sterile neutrinos with a p-value of 3.1\%.</description>

Abstract: We provide supporting details for the search for a 3+1 sterile neutrino using data collected over eleven years at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The analysis uses atmospheric muon-flavored neutrinos from 0.5 to 100\, TeV that traverse the Earth to reach the IceCube detector, and finds a best-fit point at $\sin^2(2\theta_{24}) = 0.16$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{41} = 3.5$ eV$^2$ with a goodness-of-fit p-value of 12\% and consistency with the null hypothesis of no oscillations to sterile neutrinos with a p-value of 3.1\%. Several improvements were made over past analyses, which are reviewed in this article, including upgrades to the reconstruction and the study of sources of systematic uncertainty. We provide details of the fit quality and discuss stability tests that split the data for separate samples, comparing results. We find that the fits are consistent between split data sets.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays and their impact on $V_{ud}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections are essential for an accurate determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed $\beta$ decays. In view of recent progress in the single-nucleon sector, the uncertainty is dominated by the theoretical description of nucleus-dependent effects, limiting the precision that can currently be achieved for $V_{ud}$. In this work, we provide a detailed account of the electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory (EFT), including the power counting, potential and ultrasoft contributions, and factorization in the decay rate. We present a first numerical evaluation of the dominant corrections in light nuclei based on Quantum Monte Carlo methods, confirming the expectations from the EFT power counting. Finally, we discuss strategies how to extract from data the low-energy constants that parameterize short-distance contributions and whose values are not predicted by the EFT. Combined with advances in ab-initio nuclear-structure calculations, this EFT framework allows one to systematically address the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$, as illustrated in detail for the $^{14}$O $\to$ $^{14}$N transition.</description>

      <title>Learning the Simplicity of Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplification and reorganization of complex expressions lies at the core of scientific progress, particularly in theoretical high-energy physics. This work explores the application of machine learning to a particular facet of this challenge: the task of simplifying scattering amplitudes expressed in terms of spinor-helicity variables. We demonstrate that an encoder-decoder transformer architecture achieves impressive simplification capabilities for expressions composed of handfuls of terms. Lengthier expressions are implemented in an additional embedding network, trained using contrastive learning, which isolates subexpressions that are more likely to simplify. The resulting framework is capable of reducing expressions with hundreds of terms - a regular occurrence in quantum field theory calculations - to vastly simpler equivalent expressions. Starting from lengthy input expressions, our networks can generate the Parke-Taylor formula for five-point gluon scattering, as well as new compact expressions for five-point amplitudes involving scalars and gravitons.

      <title>Stability analysis of power-law cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the stability of power-law models, focusing on an alternative approach that differs significantly from the standard approaches used in studying power-law models. In the standard approach, stability is studied by reducing the system of background FRW equations to a one-dimensional system for a new background variable $X$ in terms of the number of e-foldings. However, we rewrote the equations, incorporating $H$ into the system and went on to do the calculations up to the second order. We demonstrate by computing the deviations from the power-law exact solution to second-order in time and show that power-law contraction is never an attractor in time, regardless of parameter values. Our analysis shows that while first-order corrections align with existing interpretations, second-order corrections introduce significant deviations that cannot be explained by a simple time shift that explains the first-order diverging terms. With importance, we note that in the number of e-folds, the system remains an attractor, while in cosmic time, it is unstable. We also support our claim with numerical results. This new insight has broader implications for the study of attractor behaviour of differential equation solutions and raises questions about the stability of scenarios like the ekpyrotic bounce driven by an exponential potential. Our work also hints that the different temporal variables we use might not be equivalent.</description>

      <title>$\tilde\xi$-attractors in metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Higher partial waves in femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtoscopy is recently gaining more attention as a new approach complementary to scattering experiments for constraining hadron-hadron interactions. We discuss the effect of higher partial waves on the two-particle correlation function, which has been neglected in traditional formulae used in the femtoscopy analyses. We consider the partial-wave expansion of the wave function in the Koonin-Pratt formula to give the correction to the correlation function by a sum of the contributions from each partial wave. We also generalize the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula, which was originally derived for the s-wave interaction, for higher partial waves. We find a compact representation of the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula given by the backward scattering amplitude $f(\theta = \pi)$ and the Fourier-Laplace transform of the relative source function, which gives an insight into the structure of the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula and its relation to the optical theorem. We numerically demonstrate the significance of higher partial waves with resonances using the square potential well. Also, the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula turned out to be broken for higher partial waves, which suggests the importance of the centrifugal force for the higher partial waves.</description>
