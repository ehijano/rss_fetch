      <title>High-Precision Excited-State Nuclear Recoil Spectroscopy with Superconducting Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting sensors doped with rare isotopes have recently demonstrated powerful sensing performance for sub-keV radiation from nuclear decay. Here, we report the first high-resolution recoil spectroscopy of a single, selected nuclear state using superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The STJ sensors were used to measure the eV-scale nuclear recoils produced in $^7$Be electron capture decay in coincidence with the 478 keV $\gamma$-ray emitted in decays to the excited nuclear state in $^7$Li. Details of the Doppler broadened recoil spectrum depend on the slow-down dynamics of the recoil ion and can constrain the interaction potential between the recoiling Li and the Ta matrix of the STJ sensor. The results have implications in several areas from nuclear structure and stopping powers at eV-scale energies to direct searches for dark matter, neutrino mass measurements, and other physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>A High Precision Time Measurement Method Based on Phase-Fitting for Muon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to simplify the muon detection system, this paper proposes a high-precision time measurement method based on phase-fitting by using the digitized muon pulses which are often used to extract the energy information of muons. Thus, the time and energy measurement can share a set of ADC modules, eliminating the need for separate hardware for time measurement. The relative time of flight (TOF) of muon pulses can be obtained with high precision through cross-correlation and phase fitting techniques. In this paper, the theory of time measurement based on this digital phase-fitting method was analyzed and an electronics prototype was designed to validate the feasibility of the method by utilizing a 40 MSPS ADC for muon pulse digitization and an FPGA for phase fitting implementation. The test results indicate that a time precision better than 50 ps was achieved when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the input pulse exceeds 64 dB. Furthermore, in cosmic ray tests, the prototype exhibited favorable timing performance. These results indicate that this proposed method has the potential to be a high-precision TOF measurement for muon and other nuclear pulse signals.</description>

      <title>Production of GEM-like structures using laser-cutting techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the ionization yield of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPC) used in dark matter and neutrino experiments it was proposed the use of dopants in LAr, with ionization energies below the scintillation threshold of Ar. While dual-phase LArTPCs have excellent sensitivity to single ionization electrons, their compatibility with photosensitive dopants is hindered by gas-phase electroluminescence photons ionizing the dopants, leading to a positive feedback loop. This can be addressed by optically decoupling the gaseous and liquid phases with a barrier that transmits electrons. A possible solution relies on the use of a pair of structures based on Gaseous Electron Multipliers(GEMs) with misaligned holes. Rather than amplifying electron signals in gas pockets within their holes, their holes will be filled with LAr and a low biasing voltage, so that incident drifting electrons are drawn into the holes but not amplified. Instead, amplification will occur in the gas phase above the structures. Its core element is a GEM-like structure machined from polyethylene naphthalate(PEN). Since PEN scintillates in the visible spectrum, the risk of increased radioactivity due to the larger mass compared to traditional wire grids is negated by the potential to veto its own radioactivity. As such, these structures may also be a useful alternative to wire grids. In this work, we report the newest developments on the production of GEM-like structures using laser-based techniques, namely the manufacture of the first batch PEN and PMMA-based GEM-like structures. This process allows low-cost, reproducible fabrication of a high volume of such structures. In addition to being a low radioactive technique, we expect that it will allow the scaling up of the production of these structures at a reduced cost. First tests indicate good electrical stability, while the performance assessment is still ongoing.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of analogue MAPS produced in the 65 nm TPSCo process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of the ALICE ITS3 collaboration, a set of MAPS small-scale test structures were developed using the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS imaging process with the upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system as its primary focus. One such sensor, the Circuit Exploratoire 65 nm (CE-65), and its evolution the CE-65v2, were developed to explore charge collection properties for varying configurations including collection layer process (standard, blanket, modified with gap), pixel pitch (15, 18, \SI{22.5}{\micro\meter}), and pixel geometry (square vs hexagonal/staggered). In this work the characterisation of the CE-65v2 chip, based on $^{55}$Fe lab measurements and test beams at CERN SPS, is presented. Matrix gain uniformity up to the $\mathcal{O}$(5\%) level was demonstrated for all considered chip configurations. The CE-65v2 chip achieves a spatial resolution of under \SI{2}{\micro\meter} during beam tests. Process modifications allowing for faster charge collection and less charge sharing result in decreased spatial resolution, but a considerably wider range of operation, with both the \SI{15}{\micro\meter} and \SI{22.5}{\micro\meter} chips achieving over 99\% efficiency up to a $\sim$180 e$^{-}$ seed threshold. The results serve to validate the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS process, as well as to motivate design choices in future particle detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Vertically stacked amorphous selenium based VUV photodetectors for use in liquid noble detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the characterization of a vertically stacked amorphous selenium (aSe)-based photodetector for use in cryogenic environments. aSe has been identified as an ideal photoconductor that can efficiently convert vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light to charges even at cryogenic temperatures. We have designed and fabricated an aSe device in vertical geometry with top and bottom metal electrodes that produces an electric field perpendicular to the substrate. The top-metal contact has an open design that results in a large fraction of the aSe thin film surface to be active for photodetection. Our experiments show that the vertically stacked aSe device detects light from a Xenon flash lamp in a vacuum environment and can produce measurable signals at \(\sim \)130K. We also demonstrate a significant enhancement in the amplitude of the photoinduced signal by growing graphene on the top-metal contact and the aSe thin film. Our results provide the first demonstration of a vertical aSe based VUV photodetector that utilizes the wide-band optical transparency of graphene top-electrode. Our results could open the doorway to a potentially game-changing solution of an integrated charge and light sensor that can be employed in future large-scale time projection chambers with pixelated anode planes.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by $\Delta$E-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through improved particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>

      <title>Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare methods for signal classification applied to voltage traces from transition edge sensors (TES) which are photon-number resolving detectors fundamental for accessing quantum advantages in information processing, communication and metrology. We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.</description>
