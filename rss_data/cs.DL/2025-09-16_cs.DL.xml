      <title>Updating the Complex Systems Keyword Diagram Using Collective Feedback and Latest Literature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's internal perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.</description>

      <title>Understanding the importance of SHAPE to the UK research ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UK has a long-established reputation for excellence in research across a broad range of fields, but in recent years, there has been greater emphasis on STEM investment and greater recognition of the UK's success in STEM. This paper examines the relative strengths of SHAPE disciplines and demonstrates that the UK's SHAPE research portfolio outperforms the UK's STEM research, for each international benchmark considered in this work. It is argued that SHAPE research is becoming increasingly important as a partner to STEM as the widespread use of technology creates societal challenges. It is also argued that the strength of UK SHAPE is the basis of a strategic advantage for UK research.</description>
