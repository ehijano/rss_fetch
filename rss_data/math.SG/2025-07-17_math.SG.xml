      <title>From Barcode Entropy to Metric Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between barcode entropy and metric entropy. Namely, we show that the barcode entropy bounds the metric entropy from below for a measure from a specific class of invariant measures associated with a pair of Lagrangian or Legendrian submanifolds, which we call pseudo-chord measures. This inequality refines, via the variational principle, the previously known upper bound of barcode entropy by topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Quantitative contact Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic quantitative study of contact rigidity phenomena based on the contact Hamiltonian Floer theory established by Merry-Uljarevi\'c. Our quantitative approach applies to arbitrary admissible contact Hamiltonian functions on the contact boundary $M = \partial W$ of a ${\rm weakly}^{+}$-monotone symplectic manifold $W$. From a theoretical standpoint, we develop a comprehensive contact spectral invariant theory. As applications, the properties of these invariants enable us to establish several fundamental results: the contact big fiber theorem, sufficient conditions for orderability, a partial result on the zero-infinity conjecture, and existence results of translated points. Furthermore, we uncover a non-traditional filtration structure on contact Hamiltonian Floer groups, which we formalize through the introduction of a novel type of persistence modules, called gapped modules, that are only parametrized by a partially ordered set. Among the various properties of contact spectral invariants, we highlight that the triangle inequality is derived through an innovative analysis of a pair-of-pants construction in the contact-geometric framework.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Diffeological Frobenius Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper [R22] established "Frobenius reciprocity" as a bijection $t$ between certain symplectically reduced spaces (which need not be manifolds), and conjectured: 1{\deg}) $t$ is a diffeomorphism when these spaces are endowed with their natural subquotient diffeologies, 2{\deg}) $t$ respects the reduced diffeological $2$-forms they may (or might not) carry. In this paper, we prove both this conjecture and a similar one on prequantum reduction, and also give new sufficient conditions for the reduced forms to exist. We stop short of proving that they always exist.</description>

      <title>On entropy and complexity of coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consanguinity of entropy and complexity is pointed out through the example of coherent states of the group $SL(d+1,\C)$. Both are obtained from the K\"ahler potential of the underlying geometry of the sphere corresponding to the Fubini-Study metric. Entropy is shown to be equal to the K\"ahler potential written in terms of dual symplectic variables as the Guillemin potential for toric manifolds. The logarithm of complexity relating two states is shown to be equal to Calabi's diastasis function. Optimality of the Fubini-Study metric is indicated by considering its deformation.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We observe that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a matroid Schubert variety and prove that the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar {\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ are divisors indexed by root system data. We prove that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety and find an affine paving of $\bar {\mathfrak h},$ where the strata are given by the orbits of $\mathfrak h.$ We show that the strata of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ correspond bijectively to subspaces of the corresponding Coxeter hyperplane arrangement studied by Orlik and Solomon, and prove that the associated posets are isomorphic. As a consequence, we express the Betti numbers of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ in terms of well-known combinatorial invariants in the classical cases. We show that the Weyl group $W$ acts on $\bar {\mathfrak h}$, and describe $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb C)$ as a representation of $W$, and compute the cup product for $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb Z)$.</description>
