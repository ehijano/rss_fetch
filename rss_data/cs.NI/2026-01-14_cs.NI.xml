      <title>Hierarchical Online-Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Split Inference with Progressive Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-edge collaborative inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, latency and energy consumption. Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Sensing in RIS-Assisted MIMO System Under Mutual Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a downlink Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) system within a physically-consistent setting, accounting for the effect of mutual coupling between RIS elements arising due to sub-element spacing. The system features a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terrestrial base station (BS) and explores both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to enable joint communication and sensing. In the monostatic configuration, both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location, while the bistatic configuration separates the transmitter and receiver spatially. System performance is evaluated using Fisher Information (FI) to quantify sensing accuracy and Mutual Information (MI) to measure communication efficiency. To achieve an optimal balance between communication and sensing, the RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming are jointly optimized by maximizing a weighted sum of FI and MI. A novel solution approach is proposed for a single-user, single-object scenario, leveraging the mutual coupling model to enhance system realism. The impact of self-interference on sensing performance is also investigated through signal quantization. Numerical results reveal a fundamental trade-off between FI and MI and demonstrate that incorporating mutual coupling within a physically-consistent framework significantly improves both communication and sensing performance compared to conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models. Additionally, the analysis highlights how the choice of monostatic versus bistatic radar configuration affects system performance, offering valuable insights for the design of RIS-assisted JCAS systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization for Joint Communication and Sensing in Multi-user MIMO Systems: Characterizing the Pareto Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Pareto boundary performance of a joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system that addresses both sensing and communication functions at the same time. In this scenario, a multiple-antenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna communication users while concurrently estimating the parameters of a single sensing object using the echo signal. We present an integrated beamforming approach for JCAS in a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. The performance measures for communication and sensing are Fisher information (FI) and mutual information (MI). Our research considers two scenarios: multiple communication users with a single sensing object and a single communication user with a single sensing object. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of MI and FI, subject to a total transmit power budget for both cases. As a particular case, we address the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for the single communication user scenario. We use the uplink-downlink duality for the multi-user case to simplify the problem and apply Lagrangian optimization and line search methods with a block-coordinate ascending technique. We use projected gradient descent (PGD) to solve the optimization problem in the single-user case. Our numerical results demonstrate that joint beamforming is optimal for the multi-user JCAS system, as opposed to independent beamforming for each user and the sensing object. Furthermore, we reveal the Pareto boundary for the multi-user case, with variations in the number of communication users and the number of transmitting and receiving antennas. We provide the Pareto boundary depending on EIRP limitations for the single-user case.</description>

      <title>Tiny-Twin: A CPU-Native Full-stack Digital Twin for NextG Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wireless applications demand testing environments that capture the full complexity of next-generation (NextG) cellular networks. While digital twins promise realistic emulation, existing solutions often compromise on physical-layer fidelity and scalability or depend on specialized hardware. We present Tiny-Twin, a CPU-Native, full-stack digital twin framework that enables realistic, repeatable 5G experimentation on commodity CPUs. Tiny-Twin integrates time-varying multi-tap convolution with a complete 5G protocol stack, supporting plug-and-play replay of diverse channel traces. Through a redesigned software architecture and system-level optimizations, Tiny-Twin supports fine-grained convolution entirely in software. With built-in real-time RIC integration and per User Equipment(UE) channel isolation, it facilitates rigorous testing of network algorithms and protocol designs. Our evaluation shows that Tiny-Twin scales to multiple concurrent UEs while preserving protocol timing and end-to-end behavior, delivering a practical middle ground between low-fidelity simulators and high-cost hardware emulators. We release Tiny-Twin as an open-source platform to enable accessible, high-fidelity experimentation for NextG cellular research.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Tool Engineering and Intelligence for Agentic AI in Next-Generation Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, agentic AI is emerging as a transformative paradigm for next-generation communication networks, promising to evolve large language models (LLMs) from passive chatbots into autonomous operators. However, unleashing this potential requires bridging the critical gap between abstract reasoning and physical actuation, a capability we term tool intelligence. In this article, we explore the landscape of tool engineering to empower agentic AI in communications. We first analyze the functionalities of tool intelligence and its effects on communications. We then propose a systematic review for tool engineering, covering the entire lifecycle from tool creation and discovery to selection, learning, and benchmarking. Furthermore, we present a case study on tool-assisted uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectory planning to demonstrate the realization of tool intelligence in communications. By introducing a teacher-guided reinforcement learning approach with a feasibility shield, we enable agents to intelligently operate tools. They utilize external tools to eliminate navigational uncertainty while mastering cost-aware scheduling under strict energy constraints. This article aims to provide a roadmap for building the tool-augmented intelligent agents of the 6G era.</description>

      <title>Statistical Characterization and Prediction of E2E Latency over LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are emerging as an essential communication infrastructure, with standardized 5G-based non-terrestrial networks and their integration with terrestrial systems envisioned as a key feature of 6G. However, current LEO systems still exhibit significant latency variations, limiting their suitability for latency-sensitive services. We present a detailed statistical analysis of end-to-end latency based on 500Hz experimental bidirectional one-way measurements and introduce a segmentation of the deterministic 15-second periodic behavior observed in Starlink. We characterize handover-induced boundary regions that produce latency spikes lasting approximately 140 ms at the beginning and 75 ms at the end of each cycle, followed by a stable intra-period regime, enabling accurate short-term prediction. This analysis shows that latency prediction based on long-term statistics leads to pessimistic estimates. In contrast, by exploiting the periodic structure, isolating boundary regions, and applying lightweight parametric and non-parametric models to intra-period latency distributions, we achieve 99th-percentile latency prediction errors below 50 ms. Furthermore, period-level latency prediction and classification enable adaptive transmission strategies by identifying upcoming periods where application latency requirements cannot be satisfied, necessitating the use of alternative systems.</description>

      <title>A decentralized academic certificate issuance system using smart contracts on the tron network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a decentralized system for issuing and verifying academic certificates based on blockchain technology. The proposed solution addresses common limitations of traditional certification models, such as susceptibility to forgery, reliance on centralized infrastructures, and inefficient verification processes. The system is built on the TRON blockchain and integrates smart contracts written in Solidity, a decentralized web application (dApp) for user interaction, and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage of certificate metadata. The methodology comprised architectural design, smart contract development, and the implementation of a web-based interface, followed by functional, security, performance, and usability evaluations. Experimental results show that the system correctly supports certificate issuance and public verification, enforces access control, and resists common misuse scenarios. Performance analysis indicates low confirmation latency and negligible transaction costs, making the solution suitable for large-scale academic environments. Additionally, usability assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS) resulted in a score of 76.67, indicating good user acceptance. Overall, the results demonstrate the technical feasibility and practical viability of the proposed approach, highlighting the TRON blockchain as an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure for decentralized academic certification systems.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Layer Analysis of Network Antifragility with RIS-assisted Links under Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antifragility is an economics term defined as measure of (monetary) benefits gained from the adverse events and variability of the markets. This paper integrates for the first time the antifragility into the network based on communication links with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) affected by a jamming attack. We analyze whether antifragility can be achieved for several jamming models. Beyond the link-level gains, the results reveal how antifragile RIS-assisted links can be integrated into multi-hop systems to improve end-to-end network resilience, connectivity, and throughput under adversarial effects.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Computation via Superposed Orders of Single-Qubit Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superposed orders of quantum channels have already been proved - both theoretically and experimentally - to enable unparalleled opportunities in the quantum communication domain. As a matter of fact, superposition of orders can be exploited within the quantum computing domain as well, by relaxing the (traditional) assumption underlying quantum computation about applying gates in a well-defined causal order. In this context, we address a fundamental question arising with quantum computing: whether superposed orders of single-qubit gates can enable universal quantum computation. As shown in this paper, the answer to this key question is a definitive "yes". Indeed, we prove that any two-qubit controlled quantum gate can be deterministically realized, including the so-called Barenco gate that alone enables universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>ConCap: Practical Network Traffic Generation for (ML- and) Flow-based Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been studied in research for almost four decades. Yet, despite thousands of papers claiming scientific advances, a non-negligible number of recent works suggest that the findings of prior literature may be questionable. At the root of such a disagreement is the well-known challenge of obtaining data representative of a real-world network -- and, hence, usable for security assessments.
  We tackle such a challenge in this paper. We propose ConCap, a practical tool meant to facilitate experimental research on NIDS. Through ConCap, a researcher can set up an isolated and lightweight network environment and configure it to produce network-related data, such as packets or NetFlows, that are automatically labeled -- hence ready for fine-grained experiments. ConCap is rooted on open-source software and is designed to foster experimental reproducibility across the scientific community by sharing just one configuration file. Through comprehensive experiments on 10 different network activities, further expanded via in-depth analyses of 21 variants of two specific activities and of 100 repetitions of four other ones, we empirically verify that ConCap produces network data resembling that of a real-world network. We also carry out experiments on well-known benchmark datasets as well as on a real ``smart-home'' network, showing that, from a cyber-detection viewpoint, ConCap's automatically-labeled NetFlows are functionally equivalent to those collected in other environments. Finally, we show that ConCap enables to safely reproduce sophisticated attack chains (e.g., to test/enhance existing NIDS). Altogether, ConCap is a solution to the ``data problem'' that is plaguing NIDS research.</description>

      <title>Permission Manifests for Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents represents a significant shift in automated interactions with the web. Unlike traditional crawlers that follow simple conventions, such as robots$.$txt, modern agents engage with websites in sophisticated ways: navigating complex interfaces, extracting structured information, and completing end-to-end tasks. Existing governance mechanisms were not designed for these capabilities. Without a way to specify what interactions are and are not allowed, website owners increasingly rely on blanket blocking and CAPTCHAs, which undermine beneficial applications such as efficient automation, convenient use of e-commerce services, and accessibility tools. We introduce agent-permissions$.$json, a robots$.$txt-style lightweight manifest where websites specify allowed interactions, complemented by API references where available. This framework provides a low-friction coordination mechanism: website owners only need to write a simple JSON file, while agents can easily parse and automatically implement the manifest's provisions. Website owners can then focus on blocking non-compliant agents, rather than agents as a whole. By extending the spirit of robots$.$txt to the era of LLM-mediated interaction, and complementing data use initiatives such as AIPref, the manifest establishes a compliance framework that enables beneficial agent interactions while respecting site owners' preferences.</description>
