      <title>Hermitian and Non-Hermitian Topological Transitions Characterized by Manifold Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases are generally characterized by topological invariants denoted by integer numbers. However, different topological systems often require different topological invariants to measure, and theses definition usually fail at critical points. Therefore, it's challenging to predict what would occur during the transformation between two different topological phases. To address these issues, we propose a general definition based on fidelity and trace distance from quantum information theory: manifold distance (MD). This definition does not rely on the berry connection but rather on the information of the two manifolds - their ground state wave functions. Thus, it can measure different topological systems (including traditional band topology models, non-Hermitian systems, and gapless systems, etc.) and exhibit some universal laws during the transformation between two topological phases. Our research demonstrates for different topological manifolds, the change rate (first-order derivative) or susceptibility (second-order derivative) of MD exhibit various divergent behaviors near the critical points. Compared to the strange correlator, which could be used as a diagnosis for short-range entangled states in 1D and 2D, MD is more universal and could be applied to non-Hermitian systems and long-range entangled states. For subsequent studies, we expect the method to be generalized to real-space or non-lattice models, in order to facilitate the study of a wider range of physical platforms such as open systems and many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Dyson equations for even- and odd-order Green's functions: application to double excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the concept of the multichannel Dyson equation that we have recently derived to model photoemission spectra by coupling the one- and the three-body Green's functions, to higher-order Green's functions and to other spectroscopies. We show the general structure of the equations and how one can systematically approximate the corresponding multichannel self-energy. As a particular case, we focus on the coupling of the two-body and the four-body Green's functions in the electron-hole channel to describe neutral excitations. This formulation allows for the description of important many-body effects, such biexcitons, in a natural way. We illustrate our approach by applying it to a two-level model system, which, in a one-particle picture, exhibits single and double excitations. Our method can correctly describe both kinds of excitation, unlike standard approaches, and in good agreement with the exact results.</description>

      <title>Interleaved bond and magnetic frustration in triangular lattice $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the presence of frustrated bond order in the form of short-range charge correlations in the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic compounds $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ ($Ln$ = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd). These compounds feature two-dimensional planes of trigonal-planar CdP$_3$ units that separate tetrahedral CdP$_4$ layers; collectively, these sandwich edge-sharing triangular lattice planes of $Ln$P$_6$ octahedra. Diffuse X-ray scattering data reveal an underlying bond instability within the unique CdP$_3$ units that breaks rotational symmetry along one Cd$-$P bond direction, with long-range ordering being frustrated via emergent kagome-ice bond correlations. Our results establish $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ as a rare class of materials where frustrated magnetism across a tunable rare-earth triangular network is embedded within a dopable semiconductor with a frustrated bond order instability.</description>

      <title>Fate of gapless edge states in two-dimensional topological insulators with Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states are the highlight feature of an interface between non-equivalent insulators. The robustness/sensitivity of these states to local single-particle perturbations is well understood, while their stability in the presence of various types of two-particle interactions remains unclear. To add to previous discussions of the Hubbard and unscreened Coulomb interactions, we address this problem from the point of view of infinite-range Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction. Based on our numerical results for two models of Chern insulators, the Kane-Mele and spinful Haldane model, on a ribbon geometry with zig-zag edges, we argue that any finite interaction strength $U$ is sufficient to open a charge gap in the spectrum of either Chern insulator. We explain the differences between the two cases and present how their edge states phase out as the system enters the strongly correlated phase. We show that the closing of the many-body gap in periodic variants of these models can be connected to the onset of hybridization between the edge and bulk modes in finite geometries. Providing an example of the bulk-boundary correspondence in systems where there is a topological phase transition without closing of the spectral gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk magnetic properties of Ba2NaOsO6 are examined in the context of an appropriate space group and an atomic model of the Kramers doublet for the osmium ion. It possesses symmetry demanded by the Wykoff position assigned to the osmium ion in a canted ferromagnet. Calculated and measured values of the saturation magnetic moment, and x-ray magnetic dichroic signals (XMCD) at osmium L2 and L3 absorption edges agree well.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate quantum magnet based on 4f-electron in a zigzag spin-1/2 chain of YbCuS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed high-resolution powder neutron diffraction experiments and discovered an elliptic helical incommensurate magnetic structure in the semiconducting rare-earth magnet YbCuS2, featuring effective spin-1/2 Yb$^{3+}$ ions that form a zigzag chain. Upon cooling the sample to 0.2 K, we observed very weak magnetic peaks indexed with an incommensurate propagation vector k = [0, 0.305, 0] along the zigzag chain. The magnitude of the magnetic moment is at least one-third smaller than the expected value for the Yb$^{3+}$ Kramers doublet ground state. In an applied magnetic field, up-up-down magnetic order was observed at 7.5 T, characterized by diffraction peaks indexed with k = [0, 1/3, 0] and substantial uniform magnetic components. These observations agree well with theoretical calculations based on the density matrix renormalization group for a zigzag spin-1/2 model with isotropic Heisenberg interactions and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$-type exchange interactions derived from material parameters. The theory elucidates the quantum mechanical nature of the incommensurate magnetism as remnant off-diagonal spin correlations in a nematic dimer-singlet state.</description>

      <title>Hallmarks of Spin Textures for High-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects in modern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations in momentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature. In this work, we investigate their interplay with high-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric materials, with an emphasis on even-order harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finite even-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotational symmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvature in systems with time-reversal invariance. This symmetry breaking can arise across various degrees of freedom and impact both spin textures and optical response via spin-orbit interactions. These findings underscore the potential of HHG as a powerful tool for exploring electronic phases with broken rotational symmetry, as well as the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials. This approach provides novel perspectives for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a spin-liquid phase emerges from the interplay of strongly frustrated exchange interactions and subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</description>

      <title>Transitions from Composite Fermi Liquid to Moore-Read States in Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current progress in the description of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of rare-earth-based magnets is discussed. We show the typical values of critical parameters that define the physics of these materials for RECo$_5$ (RE = rare earth atom) using several currently popular electronic structure methods. The magnetic moments and magnetic anisotropy of 4\textit{f} atoms are obtained using several different approaches, including the total energy in constrained DFT and crystal field theory in DFT+HI methods. We also propose a Hund's rule constrained density functional method for the studies of the ground and excited states of magnets containing rare earth atoms. The method is applied to the RECo$_5$ family of magnets. The applicability and future extensions are discussed. The technique is suitable for high-throughput computational searches of new rare-earth-containing magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring nontrivial topology at quantum criticality in a superconducting processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of nontrivial topology in quantum critical states has introduced a new paradigm for classifying quantum phase transitions and challenges the conventional belief that topological phases are typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, realizing and characterizing such topologically nontrivial quantum critical states with large particle numbers remains an outstanding experimental challenge in statistical and condensed matter physics. Programmable quantum processors can directly prepare and manipulate exotic quantum many-body states, offering a powerful path for exploring the physics behind these states. Here, we present an experimental exploration of the critical cluster Ising model by preparing its low-lying critical states on a superconducting processor with up to $100$ qubits. We develop an efficient method to probe the boundary $g$-function based on prepared low-energy states, which allows us to uniquely identify the nontrivial topology of the critical systems under study. Furthermore, by adapting the entanglement Hamiltonian tomography technique, we recognize two-fold topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary condition, experimentally verifying the universal bulk-boundary correspondence in topological critical systems. Our results demonstrate the low-lying critical states as useful quantum resources for investigating the interplay between topology and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Extended Metal-Insulator Crossover with Strong Antiferromagnetic Spin Correlation in Half-Filled 3D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubbard model at temperatures above the N\'{e}el transition, despite being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover regime, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the Fermi liquid for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the location of the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methodology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can also serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous layer selective Mott phase in the bilayer Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum materials featuring both itinerant and localized degrees of freedom exhibit numerous exotic phases and transitions that deviate from the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm. This work uses the composite operator formalism to examine the bilayer strongly correlated Hubbard model. We observe the spontaneous breaking of layer symmetry, where the electron density in one of the layer reaches half-filling, resulting in a layer selective Mott phase (LSMP). This broken symmetry phase becomes unstable at a critical average electronic density away from half-filling. Furthermore, significant layer differentiation persists up to a moderate inter-layer hopping, beyond which the system abruptly transitions to an layer uniform phase (LUP). In the LSMP phase, the electrons in the two layers are weakly hybridized, resulting in a small Fermi surface. The volume of the Fermi surface jumps at the transition from the LSMP to the uniform phase. We also discuss the physical mechanisms leading to the collapse of the LSMP phase under different perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Hall plateaus at quarter fillings occur in GaAs wide quantum wells, hole-doped GaAs, and bilayer graphene. However, the interactions favoring incompressible states over compressible composite-Fermi liquids at such fillings are not well understood. We devise a method of computing the trial energies for Haldane pseudopotentials via Monte Carlo sampling. Applying it to the quarter-filled lowest Landau level, we find that tuning the third and fifth pseudopotential can stabilize anti-Pfaffian, Moore-Read, and f-wave states. The smallest deviations from pure Coulomb interactions are required by anti-Pfaffian, whose presence is indicated by daughter states in recent experiments of bilayer graphene at $\nu=\frac{3}{4}$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of the macroscopically degenerate tetramer-dimer phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the diamond-decorated square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.</description>

      <title>Frustrated S = 1/2 Chains in One-Dimensional Correlated Metal Ti4MnBi2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional (3D) metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chain materials. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming that its magnetism is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point (QCP) separating different temperature T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. 1D magnetism dominates to the lowest T, and is barely affected by weak interchain coupling. Ti4MnBi2 is the first metallic spin chain where 3D conduction electrons become strongly correlated due to their coupling to 1D magnetic moments.</description>

Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi liquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje (arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moir\'e materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-principles simulations of many-fermion systems are commonly limited by the computational requirements of processing large data objects. As a remedy, we propose the use of low-rank approximations of three-body interactions, which are the dominant such limitation in nuclear physics. We introduce a novel randomized decomposition technique to handle the excessively large matrix dimensions and study the sensitivity of low-rank properties to interaction details. The developed low-rank three-nucleon interactions are benchmarked in ab initio simulations of few- and many-body systems. Exploiting low-rank properties provides a promising route to extend the microscopic description of atomic nuclei to large systems where storage requirements exceed the computational capacities of the most advanced high-performance computing facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of fermionic many-body quantum systems presents similar challenges across various research domains, necessitating universal tools, including state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Here, we introduce SOLAX, a Python library designed to compute and analyze fermionic quantum systems using the formalism of second quantization. SOLAX provides a modular framework for constructing and manipulating basis sets, quantum states, and operators, facilitating the simulation of electronic structures and determining many-body quantum states in finite-size Hilbert spaces. The library integrates machine learning capabilities to mitigate the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimensions in large quantum clusters. The core low-level functionalities are implemented using the recently developed Python library JAX. Demonstrated through its application to the Single Impurity Anderson Model, SOLAX offers a flexible and powerful tool for researchers addressing the challenges of many-body quantum systems across a broad spectrum of fields, including atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Non-Majorana-origin of the half-integer conductance quantization elucidated by multi-terminal superconductor-quantum anomalous Hall insulator heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.</description>
