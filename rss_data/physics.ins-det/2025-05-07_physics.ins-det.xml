      <title>Development of a polarimetry method toward in-situ substrate birefringence characterization of ground-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is necessary to enrich scientific outcome of gravitational wave astronomy. Birefringence in test mass mirrors of gravitational wave detectors can become an important factor for both current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors to achieve improved performance. In-situ birefringence characterization can become an essential diagnostic tool for detector performance, and needs to be established. We report a possible in-situ birefringence characterization method and its experimental results with a tabletop setup. The scheme proposed and demonstrated in this paper can be used as a diagnostic tool in large-scale gravitational wave detectors. We also discuss possible technological developments toward implementation in future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Framework for Wide-Field Small Aperture Telescope Arrays Used in Sky Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For time-domain astronomy, it is crucial to frequently image celestial objects at specific depths within a predetermined cadence. To fulfill these scientific demands, scientists globally have started or planned the development of non-interferometric telescope arrays in recent years. Due to the numerous parameters involved in configuring these arrays, there is a need for an automated optimization framework that selects parameter sets to satisfy scientific needs while minimizing costs. In this paper, we introduce such a framework, which integrates optical design software, an exposure time calculator, and an optimization algorithm, to balance the observation capabilities and the cost of optical telescope arrays. Neural networks are utilized to speed up results retrieval of the system with different configurations. We use the SiTian project as a case study to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing that this approach can aid scientists in selecting optimal parameter sets. The code for this framework is published in the China Virtual Observatory PaperData Repository, enabling users to optimize parameters for various non-interferometric telescope array projects.</description>

      <title>Rapid, Broadband, Optical Spectroscopy of Cold Radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy of molecular radicals is an important tool in physical chemistry, and is a prerequisite for many experiments which use molecules for quantum science and precision measurement. However, even the simplest molecules have complex spectra which can be very time consuming to measure. Here we present an approach which offers the ability to measure the optical spectra of cryogenically-cooled molecular radicals with much greater efficiency. By combining a supercontinuum laser with a cryogenic buffer gas molecular source and a commercial optical spectrometer, we realize 15 nm of simultaneous bandwidth with 0.56 pm $(\approx 0.5$ GHz) resolution and high sensitivity. As a demonstration we measure and assign hundreds of lines and dozens of molecular constants from 15 bands in the $B^2\Sigma^+-X^2\Sigma^+$ system of CaF, including a low-abundance isotopologue, in a few hours. The setup is robust, simple, and should enable spectroscopy of molecular radicals with much higher throughput.</description>

      <title>Beam test performance of a prototype muon trigger detector for the PSI muEDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the performance evaluation of a prototype muon trigger detector for the PSI muEDM experiment, conducted as a proof-of-principle test at the $\pi$E1 beamline of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) using \SI{27.5}{MeV/c} muons. The detector is designed to identify muons within the acceptance phase space of a compact storage solenoid and activate a pulsed magnetic kicker for muon storage; it was tested without the application of a magnetic field. It comprises a telescope made up of four scintillators in anticoincidence with a gate scintillator, all read out by silicon photomultipliers. The study focused on characterizing the detector's response to various muon trajectories and the light yield of its plastic scintillators. Experimental results demonstrated strong agreement with Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate optical photon modeling, confirming the detector's concept and its potential for meeting the stringent requirements of the muEDM experiment.</description>

      <title>Development of Fast Front-End Electronics for the Muon Trigger Detector in the PSI muEDM Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper outlines the design and development of a fast front-end electronic readout board for the muon trigger detector in the muEDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The trigger detector, which consists of a gate and aperture detector, is strategically located at the end of the superconducting injection channel to generate trigger signals for a magnetic kicker, which activates upon the injection of muons into the central region of the storage solenoid. Within the magnetic field of the solenoid, the system configuration is optimized to meet stringent performance specifications, including minimal signal propagation delays, high detection efficiency, non-magnetic properties, and consistent operational stability under varying experimental conditions. Additionally, the design incorporates robust methods for rejecting positron contamination in the muon beamline. The results presented include performance evaluations from both bench testing and actual beam tests, highlighting the effectiveness and reliability of the electronic design.</description>

      <title>Characterization Of MOSS For The ALICE ITS3 For The LHC Run 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ALICE, one of the four main CERN LHC experiments, studies heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. For LHC Run 4 (starting 2030), ALICE will replace the three innermost cylindrical layers of its inner tracking system during Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2029). The new ITS3 will enhance pointing resolution by a factor of two and improve tracking efficiency at low transverse momentum (pT &lt; 0.3 GeV/c). It will feature ultra-thin (&lt; 50 micrometer), stitched wafer-scale Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) using 65 nm CMOS imaging technology. These sensors can be bent, forming a truly cylindrical barrel with an innermost radius of 19 mm and an average material budget of 0.09 X/X0 per layer. ITS3 development involves cutting-edge R&amp;D, including MAPS production in 65 nm CMOS, stitched wafer-scale fabrication, ultra-light mechanics, and a novel air cooling system. The 65 nm CMOS technology was validated using Multi-Layer Reticle 1 test structures. In mid-2023, the first stitched prototypes, MOnolithic Stitched Sensors (MOSS), were produced to demonstrate stitching feasibility and assess wafer-scale sensor yield and performance. Each MOSS chip (1.4 cm x 25.9 cm) contains 6.7 million pixels across 10 repeated sensor units, each with 8 pixel matrices: top matrices (256 x 256 pixels, 22.5 micrometer pitch) and bottom matrices (320 x 320 pixels, 18 micrometer pitch). These layouts help evaluate yield variations based on density and spacing. This work presents results from MOSS characterization, including power domain impedance, DAC performance, pixel readout, threshold, and fake-hit rate scans. Beam and lab tests confirmed an efficiency &gt;99% and a Fake Hit Rate lower than 0.1 pixel-1 s-1, meeting ITS3 requirements for Run 4.</description>

      <title>Daily modulations and broadband strategy in axion searches. An application with CAST-CAPP detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been previously advocated that the presence of the daily and annual modulations of the axion flux on the Earth's surface may dramatically change the strategy of the axion searches. The arguments were based on the so-called Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter model which was originally put forward to explain the similarity of the dark and visible cosmological matter densities $\Omega_{\rm dark}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$. In this framework, the population of galactic axions with mass $ 10^{-6} {\rm eV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm eV}$ and velocity $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 10^{-3} c$ will be accompanied by axions with typical velocities $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 0.6 c$ emitted by AQNs. Furthermore, in this framework, it has also been argued that the AQN-induced axion daily modulation (in contrast with the conventional WIMP paradigm) could be as large as $(10-20)\%$, which represents the main motivation for the present investigation. We argue that the daily modulations along with the broadband detection strategy can be very useful tools for the discovery of such relativistic axions. The data from the CAST-CAPP detector have been used following such arguments. Unfortunately, due to the dependence of the amplifier chain on temperature-dependent gain drifts and other factors, we could not conclusively show the presence or absence of a dark sector-originated daily modulation. However, this proof of principle analysis procedure can serve as a reference for future studies.</description>
