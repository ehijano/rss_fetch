      <title>Simplicial Resolutions of the Quadratic Power of Monomial Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given {\it any} monomial ideal $ I $ minimally generated by $ q $ monomials, we define a simplicial complex $\MM_q^2$ that supports a resolution of $ I^2 $. We also define a subcomplex $\MM^2(I)$, which depends on the monomial generators of $I$ and also supports the resolution of $ I^2 $. As a byproduct, we obtain bounds on the projective dimension of the second power of any monomial ideal. We also establish bounds on the Betti numbers of $ I^2 $, which are significantly tighter than those determined by the Taylor resolution of $ I^2 $. {{Moreover, we introduce the permutation ideal $\Tq$ which is generated by $q$ monomials. For any monomial ideal $I$ with $q$ generators, we establish that $\beta(I^2) \leq \beta({{\Tq}^2})$.}} We show that the simplicial complex $\MM_q^2$ supports the minimal resolution of ${\Tq}^2$. In fact, $\MM_q^2$ is the Scarf complex of ${\Tq}^2$.</description>

      <title>Standard multigraded Hibi rings and Cartwright-Sturmfels ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce standard multigradings on Hibi rings, which are algebras arising from posets. We show that any standard multigrading on a Hibi ring that makes its defining ideal (called the Hibi ideal) homogeneous is induced by a chain of the underlying poset. After that, we calculate the multigraded Hilbert series of Hibi rings by generalizing the theory of $P$-partition and we compute the multidegree polynomials of Hibi rings. Furthermore, we characterize Hibi ideals that are Cartwright-Sturmfels ideals.</description>

      <title>Betti Numbers of Edge Ideals of Weighted Oriented Crown Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the multigraded Betti numbers of edge ideals for weighted oriented crown graphs using a novel approach. This approach, which we still call the \emph{induced subgraph approach}, originates from our prior work on computing Betti numbers of normal edge rings(see \cite{WL}). Notably, we prove that the total Betti numbers of edge ideals for weighted oriented crown graphs are independent of the weight function.</description>

      <title>Koszul property and finite linearity defect over $g$-stretched local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linearity defect is a measure for the non-linearity of minimal free resolutions of modules over noetherian local rings. A tantalizing open question due to Herzog and Iyengar asks whether a noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ is Koszul if its residue field $R/\mathfrak{m}$ has a finite linearity defect. We provide a positive answer to this question when $R$ is a Cohen--Macaulay local ring of almost minimal multiplicity with the residue field of characteristic zero. The proof depends on the study of noetherian local rings $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ such that $\mathfrak{m}^2$ is a principal ideal, which we call $g$-$stretched$ local rings. The class of $g$-stretched local rings subsumes stretched artinian local rings studied by Sally, and generic artinian reductions of Cohen--Macaulay local rings of almost minimal multiplicity. An essential part in the proof of our main result is a complete characterization of one-dimensional complete $g$-stretched local rings. Beside partial progress on Herzog--Iyengar's question, another consequence of our study is a numerical characterization of all $g$-stretched Koszul rings, strengthening previous work of Avramov, Iyengar, and \c{S}ega.</description>

      <title>Torsion modules and differential operators in infinitely many variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper grew out of the author's work on arXiv:2504.18460. Differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck acting between modules over a commutative ring can be interpreted as torsion elements in the bimodule of all operators with respect to the diagonal ideal in the tensor square of the ring. Various notions of torsion modules for an infinitely generated ideal in a commutative ring lead to various notions of differential operators. We discuss differential operators of transfinite orders and differential operators having no global order at all, but only local orders with respect to specific elements of the ring. Many examples are presented. In particular, we prove that every ordinal can be realized as the order of a differential operator acting on the algebra of polynomials in infinitely many variables over a field.</description>

      <title>Chordality and Shellability of Higher Independence Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $r$-independence complex $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ and its associated hypergraph $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ from combinatorial and algebraic perspectives. We demonstrate that contrary to previous claims, $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ need not be chordal even when $G$ is a tree, providing explicit counterexamples. Our results establish precise conditions for chordality across several graph classes: for cycles $C_n$, $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ is chordal exactly when $n-2 \leq r \leq n-1$; for forests, chordality holds when $r \geq n-5$; and for block graphs, $\mathcal{C}_2(G)$ is always chordal. Furthermore, we show that $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ remains chordal for all $r \geq 2$ in graphs with diameter constraints. The shellability of $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ is proved through three fundamental constructions: star-clique attachments to vertex covers, generalized whiskering operations that preserve shellability under size constraints, and cyclic clique arrangements where shellability depends critically on attachment sizes. These results collectively generalize existing work on shellable independence complexes to the broader setting of higher independence complexes, revealing new connections between graph structure, hypergraph chordality, and algebraic properties of associated ideals.</description>

      <title>On Matlis reflexive modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matlis duality for modules over commutative rings gives rise to the notion of Matlis reflexivity. It is shown that Matlis reflexive modules form a Krull-Schmidt category. For noetherian rings the absence of infinite direct sums is a characteristic feature of Matlis reflexivity. This leads to a discussion of objects that are extensions of artinian by noetherian objects. Classifications of Matlis reflexive modules are provided for some small examples.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O}_E$ be a complete discrete valuation ring and $R$ be a perfect ring in characteristic $p$, we also assume $R$ is a complete valuation ring whose valuation group is of rank one and non-discrete, we prove the Krull dimension of the ring $W_{\mathcal{O}_E}(R)$ of $\mathcal{O}_E$-Witt vectors over $R$ is at least the cardinality of the continuum.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of blowups via Weyl chamber decompositions and actions on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of $X^n_s$, the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^n_\mathbb{C}$ at $s$ points in general position. We identify a set of subvarieties, which we call Weyl $r$-planes, that belong to an orbit for the action of the Weyl group on $r$-cycles. They satisfy the following properties: they appear as stable base locus of divisors; each Weyl $r$-plane is swept out by an $(n-r)$-moving curve class; moreover, if $s\ge n+3$, for any fixed $r$ all these curve classes belong to the same orbit for the Weyl action.
  For Mori dream spaces of type $X^n_s$, all such orbits are finite and they allow to reinterpret Mukai's description of the Mori chamber decomposition of the effective cone in terms of $(n-r)$-moving curve classes, unifying previous different approaches.
  If $X^n_s$ is not a Mori dream space, there are infinitely many Weyl $r$-planes. These yields the definition of the Weyl chamber decomposition of the pseudoeffective cone of divisors. We pose the question as to whether the nef chamber decomposition can be defined (in the negative part of $\overline{\mathrm{Eff}}(X^n_s)$) and, if this is the case, whether it coincides with the Weyl chamber decomposition. We conjecture that the answer is affirmative for $X^3_8$ and $X^5_9$.</description>

      <title>Singularities of square-free polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that hypersurfaces defined by irreducible square-free polynomials have rational singularities. As an easy consequence, we deduce that certain (possibly non-square-free) polynomials associated to pairs of square-free polynomials define hypersurfaces with rational singularities. This extends results on certain classes of polynomials associated to matroids and Feynman diagrams in [BW].</description>
