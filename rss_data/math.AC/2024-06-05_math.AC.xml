      <title>Some remarks on almost projective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring. An $R$-module $M$ is said to be almost projective if ${\rm Ext}^1_R(M, N) = 0$ for any $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$-module $N$ and any maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $R$. In this paper, we investigate rings $R$ over which every $R$-module has an almost projective envelope. We also characterize rings $R$ over which every $R$-module has an almost projective envelope with some special properties.</description>

      <title>On $S$-injective modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with an identity, and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $R$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of $S$-injective modules as a weak version of injective modules. Among other results, we provide an $S$-version of the Baer's characterisation of injective modules. We also give an $S$-version of the Lambek's characterization of flat modules: an $R$-module $M$ is $S$-flat if and only if its character, $Hom_{\mathbb{Z}}(M,\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$, is an $S$-injective $R$-module. As applications, we establish, under certain conditions, counterparts of Cheatham and Stone's characterizations for $S$-Noetherian rings using the notion of character modules.</description>

      <title>The Brian\c{c}on-Skoda Theorem via weak functoriality of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, given a sufficiently functorial assignment from rings to big Cohen-Macaulay algebras $R \mapsto B$, that the associated big Cohen-Macaulay closure operation on ideals $I \mapsto I B \cap R$ necessarily satisfies the Brian\c{c}on-Skoda type property. The proof combines arguments of Lipman-Teissier, Hochster, Ma, and Hochster-Huneke. Specializing to mixed characteristic, and utilizing a result of Bhatt on absolute integral closures, this recovers a slight strengthening of a result of Heitmann.</description>

      <title>Atomicity in integral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In algebra, atomicity is the study of divisibility by and factorizations into atoms (also called irreducibles). In one side of the spectrum of atomicity we find the antimatter algebraic structures, inside which there are no atoms and, therefore, divisibility by and factorizations into atoms are not possible. In the other (more interesting) side of the spectrum, we find the atomic algebraic structures, where essentially every element factors into atoms (the study of such objects is known as factorization theory). In this paper, we survey some of the most fundamental results on the atomicity of cancellative commutative monoids and integral domains, putting our emphasis on the latter. We mostly consider the realm of atomic domains. For integral domains, the distinction between being atomic and satisfying the ascending chain condition on principal ideals, or ACCP for short (which is a stronger and better-behaved algebraic condition) is subtle, so atomicity has been often studied in connection with the ACCP: we consider this connection at many parts of this survey. We discuss atomicity under various classical algebraic constructions, including localization, polynomial extensions, $D+M$ constructions, and monoid algebras. Integral domains having all their subrings atomic are also discussed. In the last section, we explore the middle ground of the spectrum of atomicity: some integral domains where some of but not all the elements factor into atoms, which are called quasi-atomic and almost atomic. We conclude providing techniques from homological algebra to measure how far quasi-atomic and almost atomic domains are from being atomic.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes and matroids with vanishing $T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quotients by radical monomial ideals for which $T^2$, the second cotangent cohomology module, vanishes. The dimension of the graded components of $T^2$, and thus their vanishing, depends only on the combinatorics of the corresponding simplicial complex. We give both a complete characterization and a full list of one dimensional complexes with $T^2=0$. We characterize the graded components of $T^2$ when the simplicial complex is a uniform matroid. Finally, we show that $T^2$ vanishes for all matroids of corank at most two and conjecture that all connected matroids with vanishing $T^2$ are of corank at most two.</description>

      <title>The Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology of commutative monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01536v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe that Beck modules for a commutative monoid are exactly modules over a graded commutative ring associated to the monoid. Under this identification, the Quillen cohomology of commutative monoids is a special case of Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology for graded commutative rings, generalizing a result of Kurdiani and Pirashvili. To verify this we develop the necessary grading formalism. The partial cochain complex developed by Pierre Grillet for computing Quillen cohomology appears as the start of a modification of the Harrison cochain complex suggested by Michael Barr.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of matroid Chow rings and intersection cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hilbert series of four objects arising in the Chow-theoretic and Kazhdan-Lusztig framework of matroids. These are, respectively, the Hilbert series of the Chow ring, the augmented Chow ring, the intersection cohomology module, and its stalk at the empty flat. We develop a parallelism between the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a matroid and the Hilbert series of its Chow ring. This extends to a parallelism between the $Z$-polynomial of a matroid and the Hilbert series of its augmented Chow ring. This suggests to bring ideas from one framework to the other. Our two main motivations are the real-rootedness conjecture for all of these polynomials, and the problem of computing them. We provide several intrinsic definitions of these invariants; also, by leveraging that they are valuations under matroid polytope subdivisions, we deduce a fast way for computing them for a large class of matroids. Uniform matroids are a case of combinatorial interest; we link the resulting polynomials with certain real-rooted families such as the (binomial) Eulerian polynomials, and we settle a conjecture of Hameister, Rao, and Simpson. Furthermore, we prove the real-rootedness of the Hilbert series of the augmented Chow rings of uniform matroids via a result of Haglund and Zhang; and in addition, we prove a version of a conjecture of Gedeon in the Chow setting: uniform matroids maximize coefficient-wisely these polynomials for matroids with fixed rank and size. By relying on the nonnegativity of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the semi-small decompositions of Braden, Huh, Matherne, Proudfoot, and Wang, we strengthen the unimodality of the Hilbert series of Chow rings, augmented Chow rings, and intersection cohomologies to $\gamma$-positivity, a property for palindromic polynomials that lies between unimodality and real-rootedness; this settles a conjecture of Ferroni, Nasr, and Vecchi.</description>

      <title>Differentially Henselian Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the class of differentially henselian fields, which are henselian valued fields equipped with generic derivations in the sense of Cubides Kovacics and Point, and are special cases of differentially large fields in the sense of Le\'on S\'anchez and Tressl. We prove that many results from henselian valued fields as well as differentially large fields can be lifted to the differentially henselian setting, for instance Ax-Kochen/Ershov principles, characterisations in terms of differential algebras, etc. We also give methods to concretely construct such fields in terms of iterated power series expansions and inductive constructions on transcendence bases.</description>

      <title>Compact moduli of Calabi-Yau cones and Sasaki-Einstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>
