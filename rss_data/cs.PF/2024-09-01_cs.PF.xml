      <title>A Scalable k-Medoids Clustering via Whale Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised clustering has emerged as a critical tool for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast, unlabeled datasets. However, traditional methods like Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) struggle with scalability due to their quadratic computational complexity. To address this limitation, we introduce WOA-kMedoids, a novel unsupervised clustering method that incorporates the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a nature-inspired metaheuristic inspired by the hunting strategies of humpback whales. By optimizing centroid selection, WOA-kMedoids reduces computational complexity of the k-medoids algorithm from quadratic to near-linear with respect to the number of observations. This improvement in efficiency enables WOA-kMedoids to be scalable to large datasets while maintaining high clustering accuracy. We evaluated the performance of WOA-kMedoids on 25 diverse time series datasets from the UCR archive. Our empirical results demonstrate that WOA-kMedoids maintains clustering accuracy similar to PAM. While WOA-kMedoids exhibited slightly higher runtime than PAM on small datasets (less than 300 observations), it outperformed PAM in computational efficiency on larger datasets. The scalability of WOA-kMedoids, combined with its consistently high accuracy, positions it as a promising and practical choice for unsupervised clustering in big data applications. WOA-kMedoids has implications for efficient knowledge discovery in massive, unlabeled datasets across various domains.</description>

      <title>Application-Driven Exascale: The JUPITER Benchmark Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarks are essential in the design of modern HPC installations, as they define key aspects of system components. Beyond synthetic workloads, it is crucial to include real applications that represent user requirements into benchmark suites, to guarantee high usability and widespread adoption of a new system. Given the significant investments in leadership-class supercomputers of the exascale era, this is even more important and necessitates alignment with a vision of Open Science and reproducibility. In this work, we present the JUPITER Benchmark Suite, which incorporates 16 applications from various domains. It was designed for and used in the procurement of JUPITER, the first European exascale supercomputer. We identify requirements and challenges and outline the project and software infrastructure setup. We provide descriptions and scalability studies of selected applications and a set of key takeaways. The JUPITER Benchmark Suite is released as open source software with this work at https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/jubench.</description>
