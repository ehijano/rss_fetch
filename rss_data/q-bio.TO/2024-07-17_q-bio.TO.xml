      <title>Analyzing the birth-death model of Oncostreams in Glioma, and the effects of Cytochalasin D treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research project investigates the critical role of oncostreams in glioma aggressiveness, leveraging advanced ex-vivo 3D explants and in-vivo intravital imaging techniques to establish a direct correlation between oncostream density and cancer severity. The primary objective is to model the cell populations within oncostreams, with a specific focus on GFP+ NPA cells, to simulate cancer dynamics and provide insights into tumor behavior. The study employs a simple Birth-Death process to analyze cell population dynamics and treatment effects, building and solving Kolmogorov equations to predict changes in cell population over time.
  While the model could be expanded to include additional modulators such as morphological attributes and neurotransmitter exposure, the focus remains on cell population to maintain feasibility. The study also examines various treatment methods, finding that glutamate increases glioma cell movement while histamine reduces it. Collagenase treatment effectively dismantles oncostreams, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy. For this paper, we specifically are going to be looking at Cytochalasin D, which shows promise in disrupting oncostreams and reducing glioma invasiveness. By integrating these treatment variables into the model, the research aims to understand their impact on glioma cell density within the oncostreams and aggressiveness, thereby contributing to improved cancer management strategies. This comprehensive approach is expected to enhance our understanding of glioma progression and inform the development of effective therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>Disk-stacking models are consistent with Fibonacci and non-Fibonacci structure in sunflowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a model of plant organ placement motivated by the appearance of large Fibonacci numbers in phyllotaxis, and provides the first large-scale empirical validation of this model. Specifically it evaluates the ability of Schwendener disk-stacking models to generate parastichy patterns seen in a large dataset of sunflower seedheads. We find that features of this data that the models can account for include a predominance of Fibonacci counts, usually in a pair of left and right counts on a single seedhead, a smaller but detectable frequency of Lucas and double Fibonacci numbers, a comparable frequency of Fibonacci numbers plus or minus one, and occurrences of pairs of roughly equal but non-Fibonacci counts in a `columnar' structure. A further observation in the dataset was an occasional lack of rotational symmetry in the parastichy spirals, and this paper demonstrates those in the model for the first time.
  Schwendener disk-stacking models allow Fibonacci structure by ensuring that a parameter of the model corresponding to the speed of plant growth is kept small enough. While many other models can exhibit Fibonacci structure, usually by specifying a rotation parameter to an extremely high precision, no other model has accounted for further, non-Fibonacci, features in the observed data. The Schwendener model produces these naturally in the region of parameter space just beyond where the Fibonacci structure breaks down, without any further parameter fitting. We also introduce stochasticity into the model and show that it while it can be responsible for the appearance of columnar structure, the disordered dynamics of the deterministic system near the critical region can also generate this structure.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Epithelial Tissues as a Double Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do cells tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues? One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solid-like to a fluid-like state or vice versa. Here, we introduce a new way that cells can tune rigidity using "adaptive degrees of freedom." We study rigidity in vertex models, using the elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as sets of adaptive degrees of freedom that can be introduced to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as adaptive degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as adaptive degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can tune properties at the cell-scale to obtain desired tissue-scale behaviors.</description>
