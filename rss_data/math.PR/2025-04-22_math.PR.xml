      <title>Darwinian evolution in Malthusian population growth model and Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of Darwinian evolution in two mathematical models. The first one is a variation on the Malthusian population growth model with Verhulst's environmental capacity. The second model is grounded in the theory of Markov chains and their stationary distributions. We prove preliminary results regarding both models and pose conjectures, which are supported by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Discrete Stochastic Population Models with Normal Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a stochastic logistic difference equation under the assumption that the population distribution follows a normal distribution. Our focus is on the mathematical relationship between the average growth rate and a newly introduced concept, the uniform structural growth rate, which captures how growth is influenced by the internal distributional structure of the population. We derive explicit relationships linking the uniform structural growth rate to the parameters of the normal distribution and the variance of a small stochastic perturbation. The analysis reveals the existence of two distinct branches of the uniform structural growth rate, corresponding to alternative population states characterized by higher and lower growth rates. This duality provides deeper insights into the dynamics of population growth under stochastic influences. A sufficient condition for the existence of two uniform structural growth rates is established and rigorously proved, demonstrating that there exist infeasible intervals where no uniform structural growth rate can be defined. We also explore the biological significance of these findings, emphasizing the role of stochastic perturbations and the distribution in shaping population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Weak dependence and optimal quantitative self-normalized central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a stationary, weakly dependent sequence of random variables. Given only mild conditions, allowing for polynomial decay of the autocovariance function, we show a Berry-Esseen bound of optimal order $n^{-1/2}$ for studentized (self-normalized) partial sums, both for the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein (and $L^p$) distance. The results show that, in general, (minimax) optimal estimators of the long-run variance lead to suboptimal bounds in the central limit theorem, that is, the rate $n^{-1/2}$ cannot be reached. This can be salvaged by simple methods: In order to maintain the optimal speed of convergence $n^{-1/2}$, simple over-smoothing within a certain range is necessary and sufficient. The setup contains many prominent dynamical systems and time series models, including random walks on the general linear group, products of positive random matrices, functionals of Garch models of any order, functionals of dynamical systems arising from SDEs, iterated random functions and many more.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limit of Dependent Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a generalized Bernoulli process (GBP) was developed as a stationary binary sequence that can have long-range dependence. In this paper, we find the scaling limit of a random walk that follows GBP. The result is a new class of non-Markovian diffusion processes. The limiting processes include continuous-time stochastic processes with stationary increments whose correlation decays with an exponential rate, a power law, or an exponentially tempered power law. The limit densities solve a tempered time-fractional diffusion equation or time-fractional diffusion equation. The second-family of Mittag-Leffler distribution and exponential distribution arise as special cases of the limiting distributions. Subordinated processes are considered as time-changed Levy processes, and the governing equations and dependence structure of the subordinated processes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Intermittency for the stochastic heat and wave equations with generalized fractional noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are looking at the stochastic heat and wave equations with different types of fractional noise. We are interested in the intermittency property and Lyapunov exponent for the solution. First we look at the equation driven by the Dobric-Ojeda noise and we show that the Lyapunov exponent matches that of the equation driven by standard fractional noise as obtained by Hu, Huang, Nualart, Tindel (2015) and Balan, Conus (2016). In the second part, we introduce a generalized fractional noise that includes both standard fractional noise and Dobric-Ojeda noise. It shows that, in this specific situation, the correlation structure of the noise does not change the Lyapunov exponent. We conjecture that this result would hold more generally</description>

      <title>Critical Ising model, Multiple SLE$_\kappa\left(\frac{\kappa-6}{2},\frac{\kappa-6}{2}\right)$ and $\beta$-Jacobi Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix $N\ge 1$ and suppose that $(\Omega;x_1,\ldots, x_{N}; x_{N+1}, x_{N+2})$ is a polygon, i.e. $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain with locally connected boundary and $x_1,\ldots,x_{N+2}$ are $N+2$ different points located counterclockwisely on $\partial\Omega$. Fix $\kappa\in (0,4)$. In this paper, we will give two different constructions of multiple $N$-SLE$_\kappa\left(\frac{\kappa-6}{2},\frac{\kappa-6}{2}\right)$ on $(\Omega;x_1,\ldots,x_{N}; x_{N+1},x_{N+2})$ and prove that they give the same law on random curves. Then, by establishing the uniqueness of multiple $N$-SLE$_\kappa\left(\frac{\kappa-6}{2},\frac{\kappa-6}{2}\right)$, we can obtain the joint law of the hitting points of multiple $N$-SLE$_\kappa\left(\frac{\kappa-6}{2},\frac{\kappa-6}{2}\right)$ with odd (resp. even) indices on $(x_{N+1}x_{N+2})$. After shrinking $x_1,\ldots,x_N$ to one point, the law of hitting points with odd (resp. even) indices converge to $\beta$-Jacobi ensemble with the conjectured relation $\beta=\frac{8}{\kappa}$. We will establish a direct connection between SLE-type curves and $\beta$-Jacobi ensemble.
  As an application, we consider critical Ising model on a discrete polygon $(\Omega^\delta_\delta;x^\delta_1,\ldots,x^\delta_{N}; x^\delta_{N+1},x^\delta_{N+2})$ with alternating boundary $(x^\delta_{N+2}x^\delta_{N+1})$ and free boundary $(x^\delta_{N+1}x^\delta_{N+2})$. Motivated by the partition function of multiple $N$-SLE$_\kappa\left(\frac{\kappa-6}{2},\frac{\kappa-6}{2}\right)$, we derive the scaling limit of the probability of the event that the interface $\gamma_j^\delta$ starting from $x^\delta_j$ ends at $(x^\delta_{N+1}x^\delta_{N+2})$ for all $1\le j\le N$. Moreover, we prove that given this event, the interface $(\gamma_1^\delta,\ldots,\gamma_N^\delta)$ converges to multiple $N$-SLE$_\kappa\left(\frac{\kappa-6}{2},\frac{\kappa-6}{2}\right)$ with $\kappa=3$.</description>

      <title>Approximate factorizations for non-symmetric jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first extend the approximate factorization for purely discontinuous Markov process established in \cite{CKSV20} by getting rid of some of the conditions imposed in \cite{CKSV20}. Then we apply the approximate factorization to obtain two-sided heat kernel estimates for three classes of processes: stable-like processes with critical killings in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets; killed stable-like processes in the setting of \cite{KW24} in $C^{1, \varepsilon}$ open sets; and non-symmetric stable processes in what we call $C^{1,2{\text - \rm Dini}}$ open sets. In particular, we obtain explicit sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates of killed $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets for all $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and of censored $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets for all $\alpha\in (1, 2)$.</description>

      <title>On a class of unbalanced step-reinforced random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A step-reinforced random walk is a discrete-time stochastic process with long-range dependence. At each step, with a fixed probability $\alpha$, the so-called positively step-reinforced random walk repeats one of its previous steps, chosen randomly and uniformly from its entire history. Alternatively, with probability $1-\alpha$, it makes an independent move. For the so-called negatively step-reinforced random walk, the process is similar, but any repeated step is taken with its direction reversed. These random walks have been introduced respectively by Simon (1955) and Bertoin (2024) and are sometimes refered to the self-confident step-reinforced random walk and the counterbalanced step-reinforced random walk respectively. In this work, we introduce a new class of unbalanced step-reinforced random walks for which we prove the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. In particular, our work provides a unified treatment of the elephant random walk introduced by Schutz and Trimper (2004) and the positively and negatively step-reinforced random walks</description>

      <title>Urn-driven random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric random walk is known to be recurrent in one and two dimensions, and becomes transient in three or higher dimensions. We compare the symmetric random walk to walks driven by certain \polya\ urns. We show that, in contrast, if the probabilities of the random walk are instead driven by a \polya-Eggenberger urn, the states are recurrent only in one dimension. Further consideration of exchangeability reveals that the walk is null recurrent. As soon as the underlying Markov chain of \polya\ walk gets in two dimensions or higher, there is a positive probability that the walker gets lost in the space, and the probability of her recurrence is less than 1.
  On the other hand, a walk driven by Friedman urn behaves like the symmetric random walk, being recurrent in one and two dimensions and transient in higher dimensions. As Friedman urn scheme is not exchangeable, it is considerably harder to determine the nature of the recurrence in one and two dimensions. Empirical evidence through simulation suggests that in one dimension Friedman walk is positive recurrent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-reflected backward stochastic differential equation with a general RCLL barrier in a filtration that supports a Brownian motion and an independent Poisson random measure. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution in $\mathbb{L}^p$ for $p \in (1,2)$. The result is obtained by means of the penalization method, under the assumption that the coefficient is stochastically monotone with respect to the state variable $y$, stochastically Lipschitz with respect to the control variables $(z,u)$, and satisfies suitable linear growth and $p$-integrability conditions.</description>

      <title>When Machine Learning Meets Importance Sampling: A More Efficient Rare Event Estimation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by applications in telecommunication networks, we explore the simulation task of estimating rare event probabilities for tandem queues in their steady state. Existing literature has recognized that importance sampling methods can be inefficient, due to the exploding variance of the path-dependent likelihood functions. To mitigate this, we introduce a new importance sampling approach that utilizes a marginal likelihood ratio on the stationary distribution, effectively avoiding the issue of excessive variance. In addition, we design a machine learning algorithm to estimate this marginal likelihood ratio using importance sampling data. Numerical experiments indicate that our algorithm outperforms the classic importance sampling methods.</description>

      <title>On minimal shapes and topological invariants in hyperbolic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular $p$-gons meeting at vertices of degree $q$, with $1/p+1/q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. The main tool is a layer decomposition due to Rietman--Nienhuis--Oitmaa and Moran, which allows us to prove convergence towards the Cheeger constant when these shapes exhaust the lattice. Furthermore, we apply a celebrated result of Floyd--Plotnick, which will allow us to compute the Euler characteristic for these graphs in terms of certain growth functions and the number of $n$-sized animals on those lattices.</description>

      <title>Hartman-Grobman Theorem for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Hartman-Grobman theorem to systems perturbed with white noises. Let's recall that, in deterministic systems, the Hartman-Grobman theorem establishes the "topological equivalence" of the local phase portrait between a system and its linearization around hyperbolic fixed points; hence, simplifying the study of the stability at those points.
  However, it should be pointed out that, the conditions for a "useful" linear approximation of a non-linear system do not solely involved hyperbolic points; indeed, Nils Berglund and Barbara Gentz for example conspicuously used it in their book [3]; particularly during their study of white noise perturbed slow-fast dynamical systems. Yet, since our focus is on behavior of critical points of a system, we need to make sure that the linear approximation of our perturbed system is equivalent in some sense to the perturbed system of the linear approximation of the corresponding deterministic system.
  The paper is organized as follow: we first establish the theorem when the "diffusion" matrix is invertible. We continue by examining the case of non-invertible matrices, and non square matrices. We then apply the results to the study of Multi-dimensional slow-fast systems done by Berglund and Gentz [3] by weakening regularity conditions.</description>

      <title>Quenched correlation decay for random splittings of some prototypical 3D flows including the ABC flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the long-time dynamical challenges of some prototypical 3D flows including the ABC flow on $\mathbb{T}^3$, we apply a random splitting method to establish two fundamental indicators of chaotic dynamics. First, under general assumptions, we establish that these random splittings exhibit Lagrangian chaos, characterized by a positive top Lyapunov exponent. Furthermore, we demonstrate the almost-sure quenched correlation decay of these random splittings, which is a stronger property than the almost-sure positivity of Lyapunov exponents alone. This framework is then applied to construct ideal dynamo in kinematic dynamo theory and to establish exponential mixing of passive scalars.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed the full discretization of the Stochastic semilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by multiplicative Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and the stochastic trigonometric method for time discretization and derive a strong convergence rate with respect to both parameters (temporal and spatial). Numerical experiments have also been performed to support theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.</description>

      <title>Sum of Independent XGamma Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XGamma distribution is a generated distribution from a mixture of Exponential and Gamma distributions. It is found that in many cases the XGamma has more flexibility than the Exponential distribution. In this paper we consider the sum of independent XGamma distributions with different parameters. We showed that the probability density function of this distribution is a sum of the probability density function of the Erlang distributions. As a consequence, we find exact closed expressions of the other related statistical functions. Next, we examine the estimation of the parameters by maximum likelihood estimators. We observe in an applications a real data set which shows that this model provides better fit to the data as compared to the sum of the Exponential distributions, the Hypoexponential models.</description>

      <title>A universal threshold for geometric embeddings of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is geometrically embeddable into a normed space $X$ when there is a mapping $\zeta: V\to X$ such that $\|\zeta(v)-\zeta(w)\|_X\leqslant 1$ if and only if $\{v,w\}\in E$, for all distinct $v,w\in V$. Our result is the following universal threshold for the embeddability of trees. Let $\Delta \geqslant 3$, and let $N$ be sufficiently large in terms of $\Delta$. Every $N$--vertex tree of maximal degree at most $\Delta$ is embeddable into any normed space of dimension at least $64\,\frac{\log N}{\log\log N}$, and complete trees are non-embeddable into any normed space of dimension less than $\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{\log N}{\log\log N}$. In striking contrast, spectral expanders and random graphs are known to be non-embeddable in sublogarithmic dimension. Our result is based on a randomized embedding whose analysis utilizes the recent breakthroughs on Bourgain's slicing problem.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{X}(n) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ be a sequence of random vectors, where $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $d = d(n)$. Under certain weakly dependence conditions, we prove that the distribution of the maximal component of $\mathbf{X}$ and the distribution of the maximum of their independent copies are asymptotically equivalent. Our result on extremal independence relies on new lower and upper bounds for the probability that none of a given finite set of events occurs. As applications, we obtain the distribution of various extremal characteristics of random discrete structures such as maximum codegree in binomial random hypergraphs and the maximum number of cliques sharing a given vertex in binomial random graphs. We also generalise Berman-type conditions for a sequence of Gaussian random vectors to possess the extremal independence property.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Bounds for the Restricted Solid-on-Solid Model of Surface Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) model is a model of continuous-time surface growth characterized by the constraint that adjacent height differences are bounded by a fixed constant. Though the model is conjectured to belong to the KPZ universality class, mathematical progress on the model is very sparse. We study basic properties of the model and establish bounds on surface height fluctuations as a function of time. A linear fluctuation bound is proven for all dimensions, and a logarithmic fluctuation lower bound is given for dimension one. The proofs rely on a new characterization of RSOS as a type of first passage percolation on a disordered lattice, which is of independent interest. The logarithmic lower bound is established by showing equality in distribution to the minimum of a certain dual RSOS process.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Stochastic Evolution Equations in the Critical Variational Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the weak convergence approach, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for solutions to quasilinear stochastic evolution equations with small Gaussian noise in the critical variational setting, a recently developed general variational framework. No additional assumptions are made apart from those required for well-posedness. In particular, no monotonicity is required, nor a compact embedding in the Gelfand triple. Moreover, we allow for flexible growth of the diffusion coefficient, including gradient noise. This leads to numerous applications for which the LDP was not established yet, in particular equations on unbounded domains with gradient noise. Since our framework includes the 2D Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations with gradient noise and unbounded domains, our results resolve an open problem that has remained unsolved for over 15 years.</description>

      <title>From Local to Global Symmetry: Activation Dynamics in the Independent Cascade Model on Undirected Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The independent cascade model is a widely used framework for simulating the spread of influence in social networks. In this model, activations propagate stochastically through the network, with each edge having a probability of transmitting activation. We study the independent cascade model on undirected graphs with symmetric influence probabilities ($p_{ij} = p_{ji}$ for all nodes $i$ and $j$). We focus on persistent activations, where activated nodes remain active indefinitely. Our main result is to demonstrate that this local symmetry in the graph structure induces a global symmetry in the activation dynamics. Specifically, the probability of node $j$ being activated within $n$ steps, starting with only node $i$ activated, equals the probability of node $i$ being activated within $n$ steps, starting with only node $j$ activated, for all $n$. We establish this result using a novel approach based on random matrices, offering a fresh perspective on the model.</description>

Abstract: A functional central limit theorem is established for weighted occupancy processes of the Karlin model. The weighted occupancy processes take the form of, with $D_{n,j}$ denoting the number of urns with $j$-balls after the first $n$ samplings, $\sum_{j=1}^na_jD_{n,j}$ for a prescribed sequence of real numbers $(a_j)_{j\in\mathbb N}$. The main applications are limit theorems for random permutations induced by Chinese restaurant processes with $(\alpha,\theta)$-seating with $\alpha\in(0,1), \theta&gt;-\alpha$. An example is briefly mentioned here, and full details are provided in an accompanying paper.</description>

We obtain an asymptotic estimate of the number of self-avoiding walks of length $n$ in the square lattice. This new formalism gives a natural and unified setting in order to study the properties of the number of self-avoiding walks in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ of any dimension $d\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Large Banks and Systemic Risk: Insights from a Mean-Field Game Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic game framework to analyze the role of large banks in interbank markets. By extending existing models, we incorporate a large bank as a dynamic decision-maker interacting with multiple small banks. Using the mean-field game methodology and convex analysis, best-response trading strategies are derived, leading to an approximate equilibrium for the interbank market. We investigate the influence of the large bank on the market stability by examining individual default probabilities and systemic risk, through the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal that, when the size of the major bank is not excessively large, it can positively contribute to market stability. However, there is also the potential for negative spillover effects in the event of default, leading to an increase in systemic risk. The magnitude of this impact is further influenced by the size and trading rate of the major bank. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the management of systemic risk in interbank markets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the solvable neural scaling model with three parameters: data complexity, target complexity, and model-parameter-count. We use this neural scaling model to derive new predictions about the compute-limited, infinite-data scaling law regime. To train the neural scaling model, we run one-pass stochastic gradient descent on a mean-squared loss. We derive a representation of the loss curves which holds over all iteration counts and improves in accuracy as the model parameter count grows. We then analyze the compute-optimal model-parameter-count, and identify 4 phases (+3 subphases) in the data-complexity/target-complexity phase-plane. The phase boundaries are determined by the relative importance of model capacity, optimizer noise, and embedding of the features. We furthermore derive, with mathematical proof and extensive numerical evidence, the scaling-law exponents in all of these phases, in particular computing the optimal model-parameter-count as a function of floating point operation budget.</description>

Abstract: We show how the AGM framework for belief change (expansion, revision, contraction) can be extended to deal with conditioning in the so-called Desirability-Indifference framework, based on abstract notions of accepting and rejecting options, as well as on abstract notions of events. This level of abstraction allows us to deal simultaneously with classical and quantum probability theory.</description>

Abstract: We can learn (more) about the state a quantum system is in through measurements. We look at how to describe the uncertainty about a quantum system's state conditional on executing such measurements. We show that by exploiting the interplay between desirability, coherence and indifference, a general rule for conditioning can be derived. We then apply this rule to conditioning on measurement outcomes, and show how it generalises to conditioning on a set of measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic contiguity from low-degree conjecture and applications in correlated random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming a natural strengthening of the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between the correlated sparse stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Scattering Relation for the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons by, (i) precisely defining the locations of these quasiparticles; (ii) showing that local charges and currents for the Toda lattice are well-approximated by simple functions of the quasiparticle data; and (iii) proving an asymptotic scattering relation that governs the dynamics of the quasiparticle locations. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigenvector entries of the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering.</description>

      <title>Effective Velocities in the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these quasiparticles, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of quasiparticles locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Tail Bounds for Canonical $U$-Statistics and $U$-Processes with Unbounded Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove exponential tail bounds for canonical (or degenerate) $U$-statistics and $U$-processes under exponential-type tail assumptions on the kernels. Most of the existing results in the relevant literature often assume bounded kernels or obtain sub-optimal tail behavior under unbounded kernels. We obtain sharp rates and optimal tail behavior under sub-Weibull kernel functions. Some examples from nonparametric and semiparametric statistics literature are considered.</description>
