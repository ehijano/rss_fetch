      <title>Chiral-odd generalized parton distributions in the large-$N_{c}$ limit of QCD: Next-to-leading-order contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon's chiral-odd generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) in the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD. Extending previous work on the leading-order contribution in the $1/N_c$ expansion, we focus on the next-to-leading-order contributions and provide a complete set of flavor-singlet and flavor-non-singlet chiral-odd GPDs. This study includes the derivation of the spin-flavor structure of the baryon matrix element of the chiral-odd operator, the proof of the polynomiality property and associated sum rules, and numerical estimates based on the gradient expansion. The spin-flavor structure of the nucleon matrix element is interpreted through a multipole expansion in the transverse momentum transfer, leading to the definition of multipole mean-field GPDs. Using these GPDs as the basis of our analysis, we take their $m$-th moments and demonstrate the polynomiality property within the mean-field framework, making use of discrete symmetries in the proof. In particular, the first moments ($m = 1$) of the GPDs are related to the nucleon tensor form factors, as generally required. By performing a gradient expansion, we compute the chiral-odd GPDs and present numerical estimates. Our results show good agreement with lattice QCD predictions.</description>

      <title>Improved Honeycomb and Hyperhoneycomb Lattice Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulations of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improved Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians for quantum simulations of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories are developed for honeycomb (2+1D) and hyperhoneycomb (3+1D) spatial tessellations. This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyperhoneycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Comparison of smoothening flows for the topological charge in QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the topological charge for several SU(NC) gauge field ensembles for NC = 4, 5, 6 with a single fermion in the two-index anti-symmetric representation, covering multiple lattice spacings at otherwise approximately constant physical parameters. Comparing the topological charge defined by the Wilson flow and the over-improved DBW2 flow we find that already at small flow times the latter stabilises on discrete values. We provide evidence that as the lattice spacing is lowered the Wilson flow also separates into discrete sectors at earlier flow times. Adopting the DBW2 definition in the remainder of the analysis, we do not see any evidence of fractional topological charges, which could in principle appear at finite lattice spacing.</description>
