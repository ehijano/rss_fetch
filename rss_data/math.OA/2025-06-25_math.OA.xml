      <title>Strong convergence to operator-valued semicirculars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a framework for weak and strong convergence of matrix models to operator-valued semicircular systems parametrized by operator-valued covariance matrices $\eta = (\eta_{i,j})_{i,j \in I}$. Non-commutative polynomials are replaced by covariance polynomials that can involve iterated applications of $\eta_{i,j}$, leading to the notion of covariance laws. We give sufficient conditions for weak and strong convergence of general Gaussian random matrices and deterministic matrices to a $B$-valued semicircular family and generators of the base algebra $B$. In particular, we obtain operator-valued strong convergence for continuously weighted Gaussian Wigner matrices, such as Gaussian band matrices with a continuous cutoff, and we construct natural strongly convergent matrix models for interpolated free group factors.</description>

      <title>Holography for bulk-boundary local topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous article [arXiv:2307.12552], we introduced local topological order (LTO) axioms for quantum spin systems which allowed us to define a physical boundary manifested by a net of boundary algebras in one dimension lower. This gives a formal setting for topological holography, where the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules of the physical boundary algebra captures the bulk topological order.
  In this article, we extend the LTO axioms to quantum spin systems equipped with a topological boundary, again producing a physical boundary algebra for the bulk-boundary system, whose category of (topological) boundary DHR bimodules recovers the topological boundary order. We perform this analysis in explicit detail for Levin-Wen and Walker-Wang bulk-boundary systems.
  Along the way, we introduce a 2D braided categorical net of algebras built from a unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). Such nets arise as boundary algebras of Walker-Wang models. We consider the canonical state on this braided categorical net corresponding to the standard topological boundary for the Walker-Wang model. Interestingly, in this state, the cone von Neumann algebras are type I with finite dimensional centers, in contrast with the type II and III cone von Neumann algebras from the Levin-Wen models studied in [arXiv:2307.12552]. Their superselection sectors recover the underlying unitary category of our UBFC, and we conjecture the superselection category also captures the fusion and braiding.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multiple Operator Integrals for Operators with Finite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Operator Integrals (MOIs) have played a foundational role in operator theory and functional calculus, particularly for analyzing Hermitian matrices via spectral decomposition. Conventional MOIs rely on the assumption of self-adjointness, making them analytically tractable for computing Frechet derivatives, establishing trace formulas, and deriving commutator estimates. However, many problems in mathematics, science, and engineering involve matrices that are fundamentally non-Hermitian, arising in contexts such as numerical discretization of differential operators, signal processing, control systems, and non-Hermitian physics. These cases necessitate a more general framework for operator integration. In this paper, we propose and develop the theory of Generalized Multiple Operator Integrals (GMOIs), which extends MOI techniques to arbitrary matrices, including non-Hermitian and non-normal cases. We unify conventional MOIs under the perspective of the Spectral Mapping Theorem and present a rigorous construction of Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs) in finite-dimensional setting via Jordan decomposition of any matrix. We establish key algebraic properties, derive norm estimates, and prove continuity and Lipschitz-type perturbation formulas. Finally, we demonstrate how GMOIs can be used to compute matrix function derivatives in non-Hermitian environments, thus significantly broadening the applicability of MOI-based methods in both theoretical and practical domains.</description>

      <title>Homology and cohomology of crossed products by inverse monoid actions and Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a unital action $\theta $ of an inverse monoid $S$ on an algebra $A$ over a filed $K$ we produce (co)homology spectral sequences which converge to the Hochschild (co)homology of the crossed product $A\rtimes_\theta S$ with values in a bimodule over $A\rtimes_\theta S$. The spectral sequences involve a new kind of (co)homology of the inverse monoid $S,$ which is based on $KS$-modules. The spectral sequences take especially nice form, when $(A\rtimes_\theta S)^e $ is flat as a left (homology case) or right (cohomology case) $A^e$-module, involving also the Hochschild (co)homology of $A.$ Same nice spectral sequences are also obtained if $K$ is a commutative ring, over which $A$ is projective, and $S$ is $E$-unitary. We apply our results to the Steinberg algebra $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ over a field $K$ of an ample groupoid $\mathscr{G},$ whose unit space $\mathscr{G} ^{(0)}$ is compact. In the homology case our spectral sequence collapses on the $p$-axis, resulting in an isomorphism between the Hochschild homology of $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ with values in an $A_K(\mathscr{G})$-bimodule $M$ and the homology of the inverse semigroup of the compact open bisections of $\mathscr{G}$ with values in the invariant submodule of $M.$</description>

      <title>Analysis for idempotent states on quantum permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Woronowicz proved the existence of the Haar state for compact quantum groups under a separability assumption later removed by Van Daele in a new existence proof. A minor adaptation of Van Daele's proof yields an idempotent state in any non-empty weak*-compact convolution-closed convex subset of the state space. Such subsets, and their associated idempotent states, are studied in the case of quantum permutation groups.</description>

      <title>Almost unimodular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a locally compact group has open unimodular part if and only if the Plancherel weight on its group von Neumann algebra is almost periodic. We call such groups almost unimodular. The almost periodicity of the Plancherel weight allows one to define a Murray-von Neumann dimension for certain Hilbert space modules over the group von Neumann algebra, and we show that for finite covolume subgroups this dimension scales according to the covolume. Using this we obtain a generalization of the Atiyah-Schmid formula in the setting of second countable almost unimodular groups with finite covolume subgroups. Additionally, for the class of almost unimodular groups we present many examples, establish a number of permanence properties, and show that the formal degrees of irreducible and factorial square integrable representations are well behaved.</description>

      <title>Corona Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11618v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a unified overview of the study of the effects of additional set theoretic axioms on quotient structures. Our focus is on rigidity, measured in terms of existence (or rather non-existence) of suitably non-trivial automorphisms of the quotients in question. A textbook example for the study of this topic is the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})/\text{Fin}$, whose behavior is the template around which this survey revolves: Forcing axioms imply that all of its automorphisms are trivial, in the sense that they are induced by almost permutations of $\mathbb{N}$, while under the Continuum Hypothesis this rigidity fails and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})/\text{Fin}$ admits uncountably many non-trivial automorphisms. We consider far-reaching generalisations of this phenomenon and present a wide variety of situations where analogous patterns persist, focusing mainly (but not exclusively) on the categories of Boolean algebras, \v{C}ech-Stone remainders, and $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras. We survey the state of the art and the future prospects of this field, discussing the major open problems and outlining the main ideas of the proofs whenever possible.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of bounded Toeplitz operators $T_f$ on the harmonic Bergman space of the unit disk, where the symbol $f$ has a polar decomposition truncated above, that commute with $T_{z+\bar{g}}$, for a bounded analytic function $g$.</description>
