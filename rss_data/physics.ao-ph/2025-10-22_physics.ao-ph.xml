      <title>Digestible Pieces: comparing three options for partitioning the Northeast Pacific Coast for S2S sea surface height prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18133</link>

Abstract: We discuss the utility of applying clustering as a preprocessing step for identifying subseasonal to seasonal forecasts of opportunity of coastal sea level using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Clustering leverages potential covariance among points along the same coastline or in the same ocean basin. To evaluate the utility of clustering for reliably identifying forecasts of opportunity, we compare CNNs trained to predict sea level probability distributions in three ways: over the whole Northeast Pacific Coast simultaneously, over predetermined clusters within this coastline, and at individual gridpoints near tide gauges. All CNN prediction tasks (Whole Coast, Cluster, Point), outperform climatology by a similar margin at Week 3 when the entire test set is used to evaluate CNN skill. However, when comparing the skill of each tasks' 20% most confident predictions, we find the skill of the Cluster and Point tasks to be on par with each other and substantially more skillful than the Whole Coast task. Of the Cluster and Point task, the Cluster task represents all gridpoints in the Northeast Pacific Coast with minimal tunable parameters. Throughout this exercise we learned that clustering gridpoints as a pre-processing step is the preferred approach between the three for making S2S predictions of coastal sea level.</description>

      <title>Channel Modeling of Satellite-to-Underwater Laser Communication Links: An Analytical-Monte Carlo Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel modeling for satellite-to-underwater laser communication (StULC) links remains challenging due to long distances and the diversity of the channel constituents. The StULC channel is typically segmented into three isolated channels: the atmospheric channel, the air-water interface channel, and the underwater channel. Previous studies involving StULC channel modeling either focused on separated channels or neglected the combined effects of particles and turbulence on laser propagation. In this paper, we established a comprehensive StULC channel model by an analytical-Monte Carlo hybrid approach, taking into account the effects of both particles and turbulence. We first obtained the intensity distribution of the transmitted laser beam after passing through the turbulent atmosphere based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle. Then we derived a closed-form probability density function of the photon propagating direction after passing through the air-water interface, which greatly simplified the modeling of StULC links. At last, we employed a Monte Carlo method to model the underwater links and obtained the power distribution at the receiving plane. Based on the proposed StULC channel model, we analyzed the bit error rate and the outage probability under different environmental conditions. Numerical results demonstrated that, the influence of underwater particle concentration on the communication performance is much pronounced than those of both the atmospheric turbulence and the underwater turbulence. Notably, increasing the wind speed at the air-water interface does not significantly worsen the communication performance of the StULC links.</description>

      <title>Space charge and ion transport in aerosol neutralization: Toward a concentration-dependent alternative to the $N_it$ product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we quantify how charged particle concentration affects the neutralization rate of aerosol particles, focusing on the role of ion dynamics shaped by internal electric fields arising from net space charge. Conventional neutralizer performance is typically evaluated using the $N_it$ product, which assumes quasi-neutral conditions and neglects electric fields from small charge imbalances. We demonstrate that internal electric fields become increasingly important at high aerosol concentrations and significantly influence neutralization dynamics. We develop a coupled ion--aerosol transport model in a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that includes ion generation, convection, diffusion, recombination, attachment to aerosols, and wall loss, with self-consistent electric fields obtained from the Poisson equation. Results show that even small net charges generate electric fields that enhance ion drift and accelerate neutralization, effects not captured by traditional $N_it$-based approaches. Using a neutralization time metric, we find that neutralization becomes slower with increasing aerosol number concentration $N_p$, higher initial particle charge $q_0$, and smaller particle diameter $d_p$ when space charge is absent. When space charge is included, the influence of $q_0$ and $d_p$ diminishes, while $N_p$ becomes the dominant factor governing neutralization behavior. Accordingly, we propose a concentration-dependent analytical expression for mean charge relaxation that captures coupled ion--aerosol transport and space charge effects. The modeling framework presented here is applicable to laboratory instruments, industrial processes, and atmospheric environments where electrostatic interactions govern aerosol behavior.</description>

      <title>Discovering How Ice Crystals Grow Using Neural ODE's and Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depositional ice growth is an important process for cirrus cloud evolution, but the physics of ice growth in atmospheric conditions is still poorly understood. One major challenge in constraining depositional ice growth models against observations is that the early growth rates of ice crystals cannot be directly observed, and proposed models require assumptions about the functional dependence of physical processes that are still highly uncertain. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODE's) are a recently developed machine learning method that can be used to learn the derivative of an unknown function. Here we use NODE's to learn the functional dependence of unknown physics in the depositional ice growth model by optimizing against experimental measurements of ice crystal mass. We find a functional form for the depositional ice growth model that best fits 290 mass time series of ice crystals grown in a levitation diffusion chamber. We use symbolic regression to derive an equation for the function learned by the NODE model, which includes additional terms proportional to ice crystal mass in the capacitance growth model. We evaluate this functional form against experimental data sets from the AIDA Aerosol and Cloud Chamber, finding that our new proposed model for depositional ice growth accurately reproduces experimental results in the early stages of ice crystal growth.</description>

      <title>Non-linear evolution of the horizontal shear instability in stratified rotating fluids under the complete Coriolis acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the non-linear dynamics of horizontal shear instability in an incompressible, stratified and rotating fluid in the non-traditional $f$-plane, i.e. with the full Coriolis acceleration, using direct numerical simulations. The study is restricted to two-dimensional horizontal perturbations. It is therefore independent of the vertical (traditional) Coriolis parameter. However, the flow has three velocity components due to the horizontal (non-traditional) Coriolis parameter. Three different scenarios of non-linear evolution of the shear instability are identified, depending on the non-dimensional Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N$ and the non-dimensional non-traditional Coriolis parameter $\tilde{f}$ (non-dimensionalized by the maximum shear), in the range $\tilde{f}&lt;N$ for fixed Reynolds and Schmidt numbers $Re=2000$, $Sc=1$. When the stratification is strong $N\gg 1$, the shear instability generates stable Kelvin-Helmholtz billows like in the traditional limit $\tilde{f}=0$. Furthermore, when $N\gg1$, the governing equations for any $\tilde{f}$ can be transformed into those for $\tilde{f}=0$. This enables us to directly predict the characteristics of the flow depending on $\tilde{f}$ and $N$. When $N$ is around unity and $\tilde{f}$ is above a threshold, the primary Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex is destabilised by secondary instabilities but it remains coherent. For weaker stratification, $N\leqslant0.5$ and $\tilde{f}$ large enough, secondary instabilities develop vigorously and destroy the primary vortex into small-scales turbulence. Concomitantly, the enstrophy rises to high values by stretching/tilting as in fully three-dimensional flows. A local analysis of the flow prior to the onset of secondary instabilities reveals that the Fjortoft necessary condition for instability is satisfied, suggesting that they correspond to shear instabilities.</description>

      <title>Stable rational approximations for parabolic equation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern parabolic equation (PE) methods for wave propagation rely on application of a variety of fractional-powered differential operators. Rational approximations of these operators need to properly map their spectra onto the complex plane, accurately handling propagating modes while annihilating evanescent ones. Standard approaches for stable and accurate rational approximations include rotating the branch cut of the operators or imposing stability constraint equations, and have yielded accurate results for wave propagation in a variety of fluid, elastic, and fluid-elastic waveguides. The stability constraint method, however, does not yield operators that are stable for all fluid-elastic waveguides, and a recent study of waveguides comprised of a thin elastic layer overlaying a thick fluid layer revealed instabilities in the approximations derived from rotated operators. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of a different rational approximation method, the recently-developed adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm, to simulations of wave propagation using the fluid-elastic parabolic equation. We find that simulations using operators approximated using the AAA algorithm provide excellent agreement with reference solutions, with errors in transmission loss comparable to, and often less than, that of simulations using the rotated operator method. In addition, we find that the AAA algorithm allows for the application of the split-step Pad\'e method to fluid-elastic waveguides, which yields a large gain in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Training Data: Confidence-Guided Mixing of Parameterizations in a Hybrid AI-Climate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent systematic errors in Earth system models (ESMs) arise from difficulties in representing the full diversity of subgrid, multiscale atmospheric convection and turbulence. Machine learning (ML) parameterizations trained on short high-resolution simulations show strong potential to reduce these errors. However, stable long-term atmospheric simulations with hybrid (physics + ML) ESMs remain difficult, as neural networks (NNs) trained offline often destabilize online runs. Training convection parameterizations directly on coarse-grained data is challenging, notably because scales cannot be cleanly separated. This issue is mitigated using data from superparameterized simulations, which provide clearer scale separation. Yet, transferring a parameterization from one ESM to another remains difficult due to distribution shifts that induce large inference errors. Here, we present a proof-of-concept where a ClimSim-trained, physics-informed NN convection parameterization is successfully transferred to ICON-A. The scheme is (a) trained on adjusted ClimSim data with subtracted radiative tendencies, and (b) integrated into ICON-A. The NN parameterization predicts its own error, enabling mixing with a conventional convection scheme when confidence is low, thus making the hybrid AI-physics model tunable with respect to observations and reanalysis through mixing parameters. This improves process understanding by constraining convective tendencies across column water vapor, lower-tropospheric stability, and geographical conditions, yielding interpretable regime behavior. In AMIP-style setups, several hybrid configurations outperform the default convection scheme (e.g., improved precipitation statistics). With additive input noise during training, both hybrid and pure-ML schemes lead to stable simulations and remain physically consistent for at least 20 years.</description>
