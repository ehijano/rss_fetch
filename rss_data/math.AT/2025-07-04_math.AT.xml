      <title>A note on the Greek letter elements of the homotopy of the $L_n$-local spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $BP$ denote the Brown-Peterson spectrum at a prime $p$, whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the polynomial algebra generated by elements $v_i$'s for $i\ge 1$. We consider the homotopy groups of the $v_n^{-1}BP$-localized sphere spectrum $L_nS^0$ with $n^2\le 2p-1$, and show that the groups contain the $n$-th Greek letter family. For the proof of this, we further show the existence of the $v_n^{-1}BP$-localized Smith-Toda spectrum $W_n$ for the case $n^2\le 2p-1$. If the Smith-Toda spectrum $V(n-1)$ exists, then $L_nV(n-1)$ is an example of $W_n$. Previously, $W_n$ is shown to exist if $n^2+n\le 2p-1$.
  We also consider the case where $(p,n)=(7,4)$, and show the existence of the delta family in $\pi_*(L_4S^0)$.</description>

      <title>The Basic Reproduction Number for Petri Net Models: A Next-Generation Matrix Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic reproduction number (R_0) is an epidemiological metric that represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The methodology for calculating this metric is well-defined for numerous model types, including, most prominently, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The basic reproduction number is used in disease modeling to predict the potential of an outbreak and the transmissibility of a disease, as well as by governments to inform public health interventions and resource allocation for controlling the spread of diseases. A Petri net (PN) is a directed bipartite graph where places, transitions, arcs, and the firing of the arcs determine the dynamic behavior of the system. Petri net models have been an increasingly used tool within the epidemiology community. However, a generalized method for calculating R_0 directly from PN models has not been established. Thus, in this paper, we present a general method for calculating R_0 for Petri nets. Additionally, we show how a computational method implementing the next-generation algorithm in ODE models can also be applied to Petri net models. We also provide multiple examples of how to use this approach to calculate 0 for various SIR-type Petri net models.</description>

      <title>Interval-sphere model structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bedrock of persistence theory over a single parameter is decomposition of persistence modules into intervals. In [HLM24], the authors leveraged interval decomposition to produce a cell decomposition of the minimal model of a simply connected copersistent space. The key tool was a technique called interval surgery, which involves the gluing of intervals to a persistent CDGA by means of algebraic cell attachments. In this article, we define a compact, combinatorial model categorical structure that contextualizes interval surgery as a genuine model-categorical cell attachment. We show that our new model structure is neither the injective nor the projective one and that cofibrancy is closely linked to the notion of tameness in persistence theory and algebraic notions of compactness.</description>

      <title>An algorithm to determine LS-category and Ginsburg invariant of any rationally elliptic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a rationally elliptic space. Utilizing the Gorenstein algebra structure of $X$, we present three algorithms that together induce a generating class of $Ext^N_{(\Lambda V,d)}(\mathbb{Q},(\Lambda V,d))$ with $N$ being the formal dimension of $X$. From these algorithms, we derive an algorithm to compute the rational Lusternik-Schnirelmann category $cat_0(X)$. Furthermore, by applying a spectral sequence argument based on the {\it Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence}, we compute the rational Ginsburg invariant $l_0(X)$ introduced by M. Ginsburg in \cite{Gin}.</description>

      <title>Classification of spin$^c$ manifolds with generalized positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $M$ is a closed $n$-dimensional spin$^c$ manifold with spin$^c$ structure $\sigma$ and associated spin$^c$ line bundle $L$. If one fixes a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ and a connection $\nabla_L$ on $L$, the generalized scalar curvature $R^{\text{gen}}$ of $(M,L)$ is $R_g - 2|\Omega_L|_{\text{op}}$, where $|\Omega_L|_{\text{op}}$ is the pointwise operator norm of the curvature $2$-form $\Omega_L$ of $\nabla_L$, acting on spinors. In a previous paper, we showed that positivity of $R^{\text{gen}}$ is obstructed by the non-vanishing of the index of the spin$^c$ Dirac operator on $(M,g,L,\nabla_L)$, and that in some cases, the vanishing of this index guarantees the existence of a pair $(g,\nabla_L)$ with positive generalized scalar curvature. Building on this and on surgery techniques inspired by those that have been developed in the theory of positive scalar curvature on spin manifolds, we show that if $\dim M = n \ge 5$, if the fundamental group $\pi$ of $M$ is in a large class including surface groups and finite groups with periodic cohomology, and if $M$ is totally non-spin (meaning that the universal cover is not spin), then $(M,L)$ admits positive generalized scalar curvature if and only if the generalized $\alpha$-invariant of $(M,L)$ vanishes in the $K$-homology group $K_n(B\pi)$. We also develop an analogue of Stolz's sequence for computing the group of concordance classes of positive generalized scalar curvature metrics, and connect this to the analytic surgery sequence of Roe and Higson. Finally, we give a number of applications to moduli spaces of positive generalized scalar curvature metrics.</description>

      <title>The band connected sum and the second Kirby move for higher-dimensional links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ be a link (i.e. an embedding).
  How does (the isotopy class of) the knot $S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the components of $f$ depend on $f$?
  Define a link $\sigma f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ as follows. The first component of $\sigma f$ is the `standardly shifted' first component of $f$. The second component of $\sigma f$ is the embedded connected sum of the components of $f$. How does (the isotopy class of) $\sigma f$ depend on $f$?
  How does (the isotopy class of) the link $S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the last two components of a link $g:S^q_1\sqcup S^q_2\sqcup S^q_3\to S^m$ depend on $g$?
  We give the answers for the `first non-trivial case' $q=4k-1$ and $m=6k$. The first answer was used by S. Avvakumov for classification of linked 3-manifolds in $S^6$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using methods of stable homotopy theory, the category of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves associated with non-commutative graded algebras with extra symmetries is introduced and studied in this paper. It is shown to be a closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck category with invertible generators. It is proven that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a projective scheme is recovered out of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves. As an application, symmetric projective schemes associated to such algebras are introduced and studied. It is shown that classical projective schemes are recovered from symmetric ones.</description>
