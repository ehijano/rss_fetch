      <title>The worldsheet skein D-module and basic curves on Lagrangian fillings of the Hopf link conormal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HOMFLYPT polynomials of knots in the 3-sphere in symmetric representations satisfy recursion relations. Their geometric origin is holomorphic curves at infinity on knot conormals that determine a $D$-module with characteristic variety the Legendrian knot conormal augmention variety and with the recursion relations as operator polynomial generators [arXiv:1304.5778, arXiv:1803.04011]. We consider skein lifts of recursions and $D$-modules corresponding to skein valued open curve counts [arXiv:1901.08027] that encode HOMFLYPT polynomials colored by arbitrary partitions. We define a worldsheet skein module which is the universal target for skein curve counts and a corresponding $D$-module.
  We then consider the concrete example of the Legendrian conormal of the Hopf link. We show that the worldsheet skein $D$-module for the Hopf link conormal is generated by three operator polynomials that annihilate the skein valued partition function for any choice of Lagrangian filling and recursively determine it uniquely. We find Lagrangian fillings for any point in the augmentation variety and show that their skein valued partition functions admit quiver-like expansions where all holomorphic curves are generated by a small number of basic holomorphic disks and annuli and their multiple covers.</description>

      <title>Comparing Kahler cone and symplectic cone of one-point blowup of Enriques surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow the study by Cascini-Panov on symplectic generic complex structures on Kahler surfaces with $p_g=0$, a question proposed by Tian-Jun Li, by demonstrating that the one-point blowup of an Enriques surface admits non-Kahler symplectic forms. This phenomenon relies on the abundance of elliptic fibrations on Enriques surfaces, characterized by various invariants from algebraic geometry. We also provide a quantitative comparison of these invariants to further give a detailed examination of the distinction between Kahler cone and symplectic cone.</description>

      <title>On the blow-up formula of the Chow weights for polarized toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective toric variety and let $\widetilde{X}$ be the blow-up manifold of $X$ at finitely many distinct tours invariants points of $X$. In this paper, we give an explicit combinatorial formula of the Chow weight of $\widetilde{X}$ in terms of the base toric manifold $X$ and the symplectic cuts of the Delzant polytope. We then apply this blow-up formula to the projective plane and see the difference of Chow stability between the toric blow-up manifolds and the manifolds of blow-ups at general points. Finally, we detect the blow-up formula of the Futaki-Ono invariant which is an obstruction for asymptotic Chow semistability of a polarized toric manifold.</description>

      <title>Floer homology and square pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a version of Lagrangian Floer homology whose chain complex is generated by the inscriptions of a rectangle into a real analytic Jordan curve. By using its associated spectral invariants, we establish that a rectifiable Jordan curve admits inscriptions of a whole interval of rectangles. In particular, it inscribes a square if the area it encloses is more than half that of a circle of equal diameter.</description>

      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, based on the a priori existence result of rectangular peg by Greene and Lobb [GL21], in which the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. The key insights are certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. We present two distinct proofs: one involves the Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. Moreover, such generic doubling result can be further extended to cyclic quadrilateral pegs based on [GL23]. In Appendix B, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>

      <title>Singular algebraic curves and infinite symplectic staircases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the infinite staircases which arise in the ellipsoid embedding functions of rigid del Pezzo surfaces can be entirely explained in terms of rational sesquicuspidal symplectic curves. Moreover, we show that these curves can all be realized algebraically, giving various new families of algebraic curves with one cusp singularity. Our main techniques are (i) a generalized Orevkov twist, and (ii) the interplay between algebraic $\Q$-Gorenstein smoothings and symplectic almost toric fibrations. Along the way we develop various methods for constructing singular algebraic (and hence symplectic) curves which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Notes on A-infinity algebras, A-infinity categories and non-commutative geometry. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606241</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0606241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop geometric approach to A-infinity algebras and A-infinity categories based on the notion of formal scheme in the category of graded vector spaces. Geometric approach clarifies several questions, e.g. the notion of homological unit or A-infinity structure on A-infinity functors. We discuss Hochschild complexes of A-infinity algebras from geometric point of view. The paper contains homological versions of the notions of properness and smoothness of projective varieties as well as the non-commutative version of Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration conjecture. We also discuss a generalization of Deligne's conjecture which includes both Hochschild chains and cochains. We conclude the paper with the description of an action of the PROP of singular chains of the topological PROP of 2-dimensional surfaces on the Hochschild chain complex of an A-infinity algebra with the scalar product. This action is essentially equivalent to the structure of 2-dimensional Topological Field Theory associated with a Calabi-Yau category.</description>
