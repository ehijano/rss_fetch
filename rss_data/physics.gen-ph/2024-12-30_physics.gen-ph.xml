      <title>What Exactly is Antimatter (Gravitationally Speaking)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been renewed interest in the idea of antigravity -- that matter and antimatter repel gravitationally - in lieu of the recent beautiful ALPHA-g result for the free-fall acceleration of antihydrogen of $a_{\bar{H}}=(0.75\pm 0.13~({\rm stat.+syst.})\pm 0.16~({\rm simulation}))g$. Precision tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) have shown that binding energy (atomic, nuclear, and nucleonic) acts like matter under gravity. Whereas the contribution of atomic binding energy to the mass of antihydrogen is negligible, the majority of the mass of the antiproton comes from the gluonic binding energy. Hence, in terms of antigravity, the antiproton is mostly composed of matter and so even if the antimatter content of the antiproton is repelled by the Earth, there would still be a net attraction of the antihydrogen to the Earth because of its dominant matter content. Using recent Lattice QCD results showing that around two-thirds of the mass of the proton (and, hence, from the $CPT$ Invariance of QCD, of the antiproton) is due to gluons, I find that in the antigravity scenario the free-fall acceleration of antihydrogen would be $a_{\bar{H}}=(0.33^{+0.23}_{-0.11})g$. The fact that antinucleons are more matter than antimatter (in the gravitational sense) leads to quite different cosmological consequences than the naive antigravity scenario (where antistars are wholly antimatter). For example, it follows naturally that there is a matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe right from the instant of the Big Bang -- but not a baryon-antibaryon asymmetry. Again, this stems simply from the fact that antibaryons are more matter than antimatter.</description>

      <title>Do We Live in an Antigravity Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.10954 I showed that, in the context of antigravity (i.e., matter and antimatter repel gravitationally), quark/lepton mass-energy is matter and antiquark/antilepton mass-energy is antimatter while the mass-energy of the intermediate vector bosons (e.g., the photon and $W^+$) also has to be considered matter. One consequence of this is that the antiproton (and, hence, the antineutron) is dominantly composed of matter since some two-thirds of its mass is gluonic. Under this premise I found that the gravitational acceleration of antihydrogen would be $a_{\bar{H}}=(0.33^{+0.23}_{-0.11})g$. This is to be compared to the ALPHA-g result of $a_{\bar{H}}=(0.75\pm 0.13~({\rm stat.+syst.})\pm 0.16~({\rm simulation}))g$. In this article I explore the cosmological implications of this definition of matter and antimatter. This leads to a quite different antigravity universe than previous analyses with, for example, equal amounts of hydrogen and antihydrogen but far fewer antistars than stars. I examine the observations used to extract various parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model of the universe and show that they are potentially consistent with the characteristics of the antigravity universe. A precise version of antigravity, one which must include General Relativity, is needed to generate a fully consistent, predictive model of the antigravity universe but even without it the antigravity scenario outlined here naturally leads to a rich phenomenology including different acceleration and expansion rates between the early universe and the present, MOND-like galaxy rotation curves, cosmic voids, and more.</description>

      <title>A physical interpretation of Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new interpretation of the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism is proposed. According to the basic premise of relativistic quantum field theory, the primitive world before the mass generation in fermions is a relativistic many-body state of virtual massless fermion and antifermion taking both timelike and spacelike paths. In order for the many-body state to have a physical meaning independently of observers, virtual massless fermions and antifermions there should move along a common direction of time, even if they are observed from any inertial fame. As a lowest-energy-state satisfying this condition, the physical vacuum with broken symmetry is derived. Since symmetry breaking arises from the kinematical reason, whatever effective interaction acts on massless fermion, it generates fermion's mass, because it escapes from the role of causing symmetry breaking. In the physical vacuum, pairs of fermion and antifermion behaves as quasi bosons due to the overlap of their wave function. Due to Bose statistics, the physical vacuum shows a kind of rigidity in transverse perturbations, and it explains the origin of the vacuum condensate in the BEH potential. As a dynamical part of the above effective interaction, a Higgs-like excitation appears. This interpretation sheds a new light on the fundamental problems inherent in the BEH mechanism.</description>
