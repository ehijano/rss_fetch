      <title>Plug. Play. Persist. Inside a Ready-to-Go Havoc C2 Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This analysis focuses on a single Azure-hosted Virtual Machine at 52.230.23.114 that the adversary converted into an all-in-one delivery, staging and Command-and-Control node. The host advertises an out-of-date Apache 2.4.52 instance whose open directory exposes phishing lures, PowerShell loaders, Reflective Shell-Code, compiled Havoc Demon implants and a toolbox of lateral-movement binaries; the same server also answers on 8443/80 for encrypted beacon traffic. The web tier is riddled with publicly documented critical vulnerabilities, that would have allowed initial code-execution had the attackers not already owned the device.
  Initial access is delivered through an HTML file that, once de-obfuscated, perfectly mimics Google Unusual sign-in attempt notification and funnels victims toward credential collection. A PowerShell command follows: it disables AMSI in-memory, downloads a Base64-encoded stub, allocates RWX pages and starts the shell-code without ever touching disk. That stub reconstructs a DLL in memory using the Reflective-Loader technique and hands control to Havoc Demon implant. Every Demon variant-32- and 64-bit alike-talks to the same backend, resolves Windows APIs with hashed look-ups, and hides its activity behind indirect syscalls.
  Runtime telemetry shows interests in registry under Image File Execution Options, deliberate queries to Software Restriction Policy keys, and heavy use of Crypto DLLs to protect payloads and C2 traffic. The attacker toolkit further contains Chisel, PsExec, Doppelganger and Whisker, some of them re-compiled under user directories that leak the developer personas tonzking123 and thobt. Collectively the findings paint a picture of a technically adept actor who values rapid re-tooling over deep operational security, leaning on Havoc modularity and on legitimate cloud services to blend malicious flows into ordinary enterprise traffic.</description>

      <title>Lazarus Group Targets Crypto-Wallets and Financial Data while employing new Tradecrafts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a malicious software sample, detailing its architecture, behavioral characteristics, and underlying intent. Through static and dynamic examination, the malware core functionalities, including persistence mechanisms, command-and-control communication, and data exfiltration routines, are identified and its supporting infrastructure is mapped. By correlating observed indicators of compromise with known techniques, tactics, and procedures, this analysis situates the sample within the broader context of contemporary threat campaigns and infers the capabilities and motivations of its likely threat actor.
  Building on these findings, actionable threat intelligence is provided to support proactive defenses. Threat hunting teams receive precise detection hypotheses for uncovering latent adversarial presence, while monitoring systems can refine alert logic to detect anomalous activity in real time. Finally, the report discusses how this structured intelligence enhances predictive risk assessments, informs vulnerability prioritization, and strengthens organizational resilience against advanced persistent threats. By integrating detailed technical insights with strategic threat landscape mapping, this malware analysis report not only reconstructs past adversary actions but also establishes a robust foundation for anticipating and mitigating future attacks.</description>
