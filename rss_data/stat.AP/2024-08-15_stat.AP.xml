      <title>Variant Specific Treatment Effects with Applications in Vaccine Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathogens usually exist in heterogeneous variants, like subtypes and strains. Quantifying treatment effects on the different variants is important for guiding prevention policies and treatment development. Here we ground analyses of variant-specific effects on a formal framework for causal inference. This allows us to clarify the interpretation of existing methods and define new estimands. Unlike most of the existing literature, we explicitly consider the (realistic) setting with interference in the target population: even if individuals can be sensibly perceived as iid in randomized trial data, there will often be interference in the target population where treatments, like vaccines, are rolled out. Thus, one of our contributions is to derive explicit conditions guaranteeing that commonly reported vaccine efficacy parameters quantify well-defined causal effects, also in the presence of interference. Furthermore, our results give alternative justifications for reporting estimands on the relative, rather than absolute, scale. We illustrate the findings with an analysis of a large HIV1 vaccine trial, where there is interest in distinguishing vaccine effects on viruses with different genome sequences.</description>

      <title>Local linear smoothing for regression surfaces on the simplex using Dirichlet kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a local linear smoother for regression surfaces on the simplex. The estimator solves a least-squares regression problem weighted by a locally adaptive Dirichlet kernel, ensuring excellent boundary properties. Asymptotic results for the bias, variance, mean squared error, and mean integrated squared error are derived, generalizing the univariate results of Chen (2002). A simulation study shows that the proposed local linear estimator with Dirichlet kernel outperforms its only direct competitor in the literature, the Nadaraya-Watson estimator with Dirichlet kernel due to Bouzebda, Nezzal, and Elhattab (2024).</description>

      <title>Understanding Brain Aging Across Populations: A Comprehensive Framework for Structural Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding distinct neurological aging patterns across various populations is vital in the context of a globally aging populace. This study seeks to unravel the structural variations in the aging brain, taking into consideration different ethnic backgrounds. MRI data from Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian populations were analyzed using a two-pronged approach. Initially, a group analysis was performed involving tissue segmentation through FSL-FAST, examining gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Subsequently, a continuous model-based analysis was employed, defining aging as a diffeomorphic transformation, which facilitated a detailed intra- and inter-population analysis, and examined both global anatomy and age-dependent distances of each population in comparison to the Indian population. Detailed insights into the spatial distribution of brain deformations over time were obtained, with particular focus on anatomical changes relative to a reference time point. The proposed comprehensive structural comparison framework, applied to a sample dataset encompassing four distinct populations, represents a pioneering effort to compare structural differences related to brain aging on a global scale. Subsequent studies utilizing larger datasets and applying the proposed analysis across groups based on various criteria will further advance our understanding of aging-related changes.</description>

      <title>Your MMM is Broken: Identification of Nonlinear and Time-varying Effects in Marketing Mix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a resurgence in interest in marketing mix models (MMMs), which are aggregate-level models of marketing effectiveness. Often these models incorporate nonlinear effects, and either implicitly or explicitly assume that marketing effectiveness varies over time. In this paper, we show that nonlinear and time-varying effects are often not identifiable from standard marketing mix data: while certain data patterns may be suggestive of nonlinear effects, such patterns may also emerge under simpler models that incorporate dynamics in marketing effectiveness. This lack of identification is problematic because nonlinearities and dynamics suggest fundamentally different optimal marketing allocations. We examine this identification issue through theory and simulations, wherein we explore the exact conditions under which conflation between the two types of models is likely to occur. In doing so, we introduce a flexible Bayesian nonparametric model that allows us to both flexibly simulate and estimate different data-generating processes. We show that conflating the two types of effects is especially likely in the presence of autocorrelated marketing variables, which are common in practice, especially given the widespread use of stock variables to capture long-run effects of advertising. We illustrate these ideas through numerous empirical applications to real-world marketing mix data, showing the prevalence of the conflation issue in practice. Finally, we show how marketers can avoid this conflation, by designing experiments that strategically manipulate spending in ways that pin down model form.</description>

      <title>Inference for Local Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference for impulse responses estimated with local projections presents interesting challenges and opportunities. Analysts typically want to assess the precision of individual estimates, explore the dynamic evolution of the response over particular regions, and generally determine whether the impulse generates a response that is any different from the null of no effect. Each of these goals requires a different approach to inference. In this article, we provide an overview of results that have appeared in the literature in the past 20 years along with some new procedures that we introduce here.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Dynamics and Order Size Modelling Using Compound Hawkes Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08927v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawkes Process has been used to model Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics in several ways in the literature however the focus has been limited to capturing the inter-event times while the order size is usually assumed to be constant. We propose a novel methodology of using Compound Hawkes Process for the LOB where each event has an order size sampled from a calibrated distribution. The process is formulated in a novel way such that the spread of the process always remains positive. Further, we condition the model parameters on time of day to support empirical observations. We make use of an enhanced non-parametric method to calibrate the Hawkes kernels and allow for inhibitory cross-excitation kernels. We showcase the results and quality of fits for an equity stock's LOB in the NASDAQ exchange and compare them against several baselines. Finally, we conduct a market impact study of the simulator and show the empirical observation of a concave market impact function is indeed replicated.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Energy Algorithmic Trading: Integrating Hidden Markov Models with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantitative finance, machine learning methods are essential for alpha generation. This study introduces a new approach that combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio optimization. During the COVID period (2019-2022), this dual-model approach achieved a 83% return with a Sharpe ratio of 0.77. It incorporates two risk models to enhance risk management, showing efficiency during volatile periods. The methodology was implemented on the QuantConnect platform, which was chosen for its robust framework and experimental reproducibility. The system, which predicts future price movements, includes a three-year warm-up to ensure proper algorithm function. It targets highly liquid, large-cap energy stocks to ensure stable and predictable performance while also considering broker payments. The dual-model alpha system utilizes log returns to select the optimal state based on the historical performance. It combines state predictions with neural network outputs, which are based on historical data, to generate trading signals. This study examined the architecture of the trading system, data pre-processing, training, and performance. The full code and backtesting data are available under the QuantConnect terms.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Poisson additive process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Poisson additive process is a binary conditionally additive process such that the first is the Poisson process provided the second is given. We prove the existence and uniqueness of predictable increasing mean intensity for the Poisson additive process. Besides, we establish a likelihood ratio formula for the Poisson additive process. It directly implies there doesn't exist an anticipative Poisson additive process which is absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Poisson process, which confirms a conjecture proposed by P. Br\'emaud in his PhD thesis in 1972. When applied to the Hawkes process, it concludes that the self-exciting function is constant. Similar results are also obtained for the Wiener additive process and Markov additive process.</description>
