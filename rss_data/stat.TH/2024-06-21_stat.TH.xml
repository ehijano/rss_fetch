      <title>High-probability minimax lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimax risk is often considered as a gold standard against which we can compare specific statistical procedures. Nevertheless, as has been observed recently in robust and heavy-tailed estimation problems, the inherent reduction of the (random) loss to its expectation may entail a significant loss of information regarding its tail behaviour. In an attempt to avoid such a loss, we introduce the notion of a minimax quantile, and seek to articulate its dependence on the quantile level. To this end, we develop high-probability variants of the classical Le Cam and Fano methods, as well as a technique to convert local minimax risk lower bounds to lower bounds on minimax quantiles. To illustrate the power of our framework, we deploy our techniques on several examples, recovering recent results in robust mean estimation and stochastic convex optimisation, as well as obtaining several new results in covariance matrix estimation, sparse linear regression, nonparametric density estimation and isotonic regression. Our overall goal is to argue that minimax quantiles can provide a finer-grained understanding of the difficulty of statistical problems, and that, in wide generality, lower bounds on these quantities can be obtained via user-friendly tools.</description>

      <title>Sharp oracle inequalities and universality of the AIC and FPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two landmark papers, Akaike introduced the AIC and FPE, demonstrating their significant usefulness for prediction. In subsequent seminal works, Shibata developed a notion of asymptotic efficiency and showed that both AIC and FPE are optimal, setting the stage for decades-long developments and research in this area and beyond. Conceptually, the theory of efficiency is universal in the sense that it (formally) only relies on second-order properties of the underlying process $(X_t)_{t\in \mathbb{Z}}$, but, so far, almost all (efficiency) results require the much stronger assumption of a linear process with independent innovations. In this work, we establish sharp oracle inequalities subject only to a very general notion of weak dependence, establishing a universal property of the AIC and FPE. A direct corollary of our inequalities is asymptotic efficiency of these criteria. Our framework contains many prominent dynamical systems such as random walks on the regular group, functionals of iterated random systems, functionals of (augmented) Garch models of any order, functionals of (Banach space valued) linear processes, possibly infinite memory Markov chains, dynamical systems arising from SDEs, and many more.</description>

      <title>Generalization error of min-norm interpolators in transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the generalization error of pooled min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation in transfer learning where data from diverse distributions are available. Min-norm interpolators emerge naturally as implicit regularized limits of modern machine learning algorithms. Previous work characterized their out-of-distribution risk when samples from the test distribution are unavailable during training. However, in many applications, a limited amount of test data may be available during training, yet properties of min-norm interpolation in this setting are not well-understood. We address this gap by characterizing the bias and variance of pooled min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation under covariate and model shifts. The pooled interpolator captures both early fusion and a form of intermediate fusion. Our results have several implications: under model shift, for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), adding data always hurts. For higher SNR, transfer learning helps as long as the shift-to-signal (SSR) ratio lies below a threshold that we characterize explicitly. By consistently estimating these ratios, we provide a data-driven method to determine: (i) when the pooled interpolator outperforms the target-based interpolator, and (ii) the optimal number of target samples that minimizes the generalization error. Under covariate shift, if the source sample size is small relative to the dimension, heterogeneity between between domains improves the risk, and vice versa. We establish a novel anisotropic local law to achieve these characterizations, which may be of independent interest in random matrix theory. We supplement our theoretical characterizations with comprehensive simulations that demonstrate the finite-sample efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimation and Confounding Robust Surrogate Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jackknife instrumental variable estimation (JIVE) is a classic method to leverage many weak instrumental variables (IVs) to estimate linear structural models, overcoming the bias of standard methods like two-stage least squares. In this paper, we extend the jackknife approach to nonparametric IV (NPIV) models with many weak IVs. Since NPIV characterizes the structural regression as having residuals projected onto the IV being zero, existing approaches minimize an estimate of the average squared projected residuals, but their estimates are biased under many weak IVs. We introduce an IV splitting device inspired by JIVE to remove this bias, and by carefully studying this split-IV empirical process we establish learning rates that depend on generic complexity measures of the nonparametric hypothesis class. We then turn to leveraging this for semiparametric inference on average treatment effects (ATEs) on unobserved long-term outcomes predicted from short-term surrogates, using historical experiments as IVs to learn this nonparametric predictive relationship even in the presence of confounding between short- and long-term observations. Using split-IV estimates of a debiasing nuisance, we develop asymptotically normal estimates for predicted ATEs, enabling inference.</description>

      <title>Concentration of a sparse Bayesian model with Horseshoe prior in estimating high-dimensional precision matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision matrices are crucial in many fields such as social networks, neuroscience, and economics, representing the edge structure of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs), where a zero in an off-diagonal position of the precision matrix indicates conditional independence between nodes. In high-dimensional settings where the dimension of the precision matrix $p$ exceeds the sample size $n$ and the matrix is sparse, methods like graphical Lasso, graphical SCAD, and CLIME are popular for estimating GGMs. While frequentist methods are well-studied, Bayesian approaches for (unstructured) sparse precision matrices are less explored. The graphical horseshoe estimate by \citet{li2019graphical}, applying the global-local horseshoe prior, shows superior empirical performance, but theoretical work for sparse precision matrix estimations using shrinkage priors is limited. This paper addresses these gaps by providing concentration results for the tempered posterior with the fully specified horseshoe prior in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, we also provide novel theoretical results for model misspecification, offering a general oracle inequality for the posterior.</description>

      <title>Gradient Estimation via Differentiable Metropolis-Hastings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metropolis-Hastings estimates intractable expectations - can differentiating the algorithm estimate their gradients? The challenge is that Metropolis-Hastings trajectories are not conventionally differentiable due to the discrete accept/reject steps. Using a technique based on recoupling chains, our method differentiates through the Metropolis-Hastings sampler itself, allowing us to estimate gradients with respect to a parameter of otherwise intractable expectations. Our main contribution is a proof of strong consistency and a central limit theorem for our estimator under assumptions that hold in common Bayesian inference problems. The proofs augment the sampler chain with latent information, and formulate the estimator as a stopping tail functional of this augmented chain. We demonstrate our method on examples of Bayesian sensitivity analysis and optimizing a random walk Metropolis proposal.</description>

      <title>Sharp detection of low-dimensional structure in probability measures via dimensional logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.</description>

      <title>Coupled Input-Output Dimension Reduction: Application to Goal-oriented Bayesian Experimental Design and Global Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a high-dimensional function. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most sensitive parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.</description>

      <title>Temporal label recovery from noisy dynamical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing dynamical data often requires information of the temporal labels, but such information is unavailable in many applications. Recovery of these temporal labels, closely related to the seriation or sequencing problem, becomes crucial in the study. However, challenges arise due to the nonlinear nature of the data and the complexity of the underlying dynamical system, which may be periodic or non-periodic. Additionally, noise within the feature space complicates the theoretical analysis. Our work develops spectral algorithms that leverage manifold learning concepts to recover temporal labels from noisy data. We first construct the graph Laplacian of the data, and then employ the second (and the third) Fiedler vectors to recover temporal labels. This method can be applied to both periodic and aperiodic cases. It also does not require monotone properties on the similarity matrix, which are commonly assumed in existing spectral seriation algorithms. We develop the $\ell_{\infty}$ error of our estimators for the temporal labels and ranking, without assumptions on the eigen-gap. In numerical analysis, our method outperforms spectral seriation algorithms based on a similarity matrix. The performance of our algorithms is further demonstrated on a synthetic biomolecule data example.</description>

      <title>Random pairing MLE for estimation of item parameters in Rasch model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rasch model, a classical model in the item response theory, is widely used in psychometrics to model the relationship between individuals' latent traits and their binary responses on assessments or questionnaires. In this paper, we introduce a new likelihood-based estimator -- random pairing maximum likelihood estimator ($\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$) and its bootstrapped variant multiple random pairing MLE ($\mathsf{MRP\text{-}MLE}$) that faithfully estimate the item parameters in the Rasch model. The new estimators have several appealing features compared to existing ones. First, both work for sparse observations, an increasingly important scenario in the big data era. Second, both estimators are provably minimax optimal in terms of finite sample $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error. Lastly, $\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$ admits precise distributional characterization that allows uncertainty quantification on the item parameters, e.g., construction of confidence intervals of the item parameters. The main idea underlying $\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$ and $\mathsf{MRP\text{-}MLE}$ is to randomly pair user-item responses to form item-item comparisons. This is carefully designed to reduce the problem size while retaining statistical independence. We also provide empirical evidence of the efficacy of the two new estimators using both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>On estimation and order selection for multivariate extremes via clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the estimation of multivariate extreme models with a discrete spectral measure using spherical clustering techniques. The primary contribution involves devising a method for selecting the order, that is, the number of clusters. The method consistently identifies the true order, i.e., the number of spectral atoms, and enjoys intuitive implementation in practice. Specifically, we introduce an extra penalty term to the well-known simplified average silhouette width, which penalizes small cluster sizes and small dissimilarities between cluster centers. Consequently, we provide a consistent method for determining the order of a max-linear factor model, where a typical information-based approach is not viable. Our second contribution is a large-deviation-type analysis for estimating the discrete spectral measure through clustering methods, which serves as an assessment of the convergence quality of clustering-based estimation for multivariate extremes. Additionally, as a third contribution, we discuss how estimating the discrete measure can lead to parameter estimations of heavy-tailed factor models. We also present simulations and real-data studies that demonstrate order selection and factor model estimation.</description>

Abstract: The problem of computing posterior functionals in general high-dimensional statistical models with possibly non-log-concave likelihood functions is considered. Based on the proof strategy of [49], but using only local likelihood conditions and without relying on M-estimation theory, nonasymptotic statistical and computational guarantees are provided for a gradient based MCMC algorithm. Given a suitable initialiser, these guarantees scale polynomially in key algorithmic quantities. The abstract results are applied to several concrete statistical models, including density estimation, nonparametric regression with generalised linear models and a canonical statistical non-linear inverse problem from PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the variational inference problem of minimizing a regularized R\'enyi divergence over an exponential family, and propose a relaxed moment-matching algorithm, which includes a proximal-like step. Using the information-geometric link between Bregman divergences and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, this algorithm is shown to be equivalent to a Bregman proximal gradient algorithm. This novel perspective allows us to exploit the geometry of our approximate model while using stochastic black-box updates. We use this point of view to prove strong convergence guarantees including monotonic decrease of the objective, convergence to a stationary point or to the minimizer, and geometric convergence rates. These new theoretical insights lead to a versatile, robust, and competitive method, as illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonparametric statistics, rate-optimal estimators typically balance bias and stochastic error. The recent work on overparametrization raises the question whether rate-optimal estimators exist that do not obey this trade-off. In this work we consider pointwise estimation in the Gaussian white noise model with regression function $f$ in a class of $\beta$-H\"older smooth functions. Let 'worst-case' refer to the supremum over all functions $f$ in the H\"older class. It is shown that any estimator with worst-case bias $\lesssim n^{-\beta/(2\beta+1)}=: \psi_n$ must necessarily also have a worst-case mean absolute deviation that is lower bounded by $\gtrsim \psi_n.$ To derive the result, we establish abstract inequalities relating the change of expectation for two probability measures to the mean absolute deviation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider noisy observations of a distribution with unknown support. In the deconvolution model, it has been proved recently [19] that, under very mild assumptions, it is possible to solve the deconvolution problem without knowing the noise distribution and with no sample of the noise. We first give general settings where the theory applies and provide classes of supports that can be recovered in this context. We then exhibit classes of distributions over which we prove adaptive minimax rates (up to a log log factor) for the estimation of the support in Hausdorff distance. Moreover, for the class of distributions with compact support, we provide estimators of the unknown (in general singular) distribution and prove maximum rates in Wasserstein distance. We also prove an almost matching lower bound on the associated minimax risk.</description>

Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) sampling is a popular method for estimating the statistics (e.g. expectation and variance) of a random variable. Its slow convergence has led to the emergence of advanced techniques to reduce the variance of the MC estimator for the outputs of computationally expensive solvers. The control variates (CV) method corrects the MC estimator with a term derived from auxiliary random variables that are highly correlated with the original random variable. These auxiliary variables may come from surrogate models. Such a surrogate-based CV strategy is extended here to the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) framework, which relies on a sequence of levels corresponding to numerical simulators with increasing accuracy and computational cost. MLMC combines output samples obtained across levels, into a telescopic sum of differences between MC estimators for successive fidelities. In this paper, we introduce three multilevel variance reduction strategies that rely on surrogate-based CV and MLMC. MLCV is presented as an extension of CV where the correction terms devised from surrogate models for simulators of different levels add up. MLMC-CV improves the MLMC estimator by using a CV based on a surrogate of the correction term at each level. Further variance reduction is achieved by using the surrogate-based CVs of all the levels in the MLMC-MLCV strategy. Alternative solutions that reduce the subset of surrogates used for the multilevel estimation are also introduced. The proposed methods are tested on a test case from the literature consisting of a spectral discretization of an uncertain 1D heat equation, where the statistic of interest is the expected value of the integrated temperature along the domain at a given time. The results are assessed in terms of the accuracy and computational cost of the multilevel estimators, depending on whether the construction of the surrogates, and the associated computational cost, precede the evaluation of the estimator. It was shown that when the lower fidelity outputs are strongly correlated with the high-fidelity outputs, a significant variance reduction is obtained when using surrogate models for the coarser levels only. It was also shown that taking advantage of pre-existing surrogate models proves to be an even more efficient strategy.</description>

      <title>Convergence guarantees for forward gradient descent in the linear regression model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renewed interest in the relationship between artificial and biological neural networks motivates the study of gradient-free methods. Considering the linear regression model with random design, we theoretically analyze in this work the biologically motivated (weight-perturbed) forward gradient scheme that is based on random linear combination of the gradient. If d denotes the number of parameters and k the number of samples, we prove that the mean squared error of this method converges for $k\gtrsim d^2\log(d)$ with rate $d^2\log(d)/k.$ Compared to the dimension dependence d for stochastic gradient descent, an additional factor $d\log(d)$ occurs.</description>

      <title>On variational inference and maximum likelihood estimation with the {\lambda}-exponential family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\lambda}-exponential family has recently been proposed to generalize the exponential family. While the exponential family is well-understood and widely used, this it not the case of the {\lambda}-exponential family. However, many applications require models that are more general than the exponential family. In this work, we propose a theoretical and algorithmic framework to solve variational inference and maximum likelihood estimation problems over the {\lambda}-exponential family. We give new sufficient optimality conditions for variational inference problems. Our conditions take the form of generalized moment-matching conditions and generalize existing similar results for the exponential family. We exhibit novel characterizations of the solutions of maximum likelihood estimation problems, that recover optimality conditions in the case of the exponential family. For the resolution of both problems, we propose novel proximal-like algorithms that exploit the geometry underlying the {\lambda}-exponential family. These new theoretical and methodological insights are tested on numerical examples, showcasing their usefulness and interest, especially on heavy-tailed target distributions.</description>

Abstract: We provide a novel dimension-free uniform concentration bound for the empirical risk function of constrained logistic regression. Our bound yields a milder sufficient condition for a uniform law of large numbers than conditions derived by the Rademacher complexity argument and McDiarmid's inequality. The derivation is based on the PAC-Bayes approach with second-order expansion and Rademacher-complexity-based bounds for the residual term of the expansion.</description>

      <title>Integral Probability Metrics on submanifolds: interpolation inequalities and optimal inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study interpolation inequalities between H\"older Integral Probability Metrics (IPMs) in the case where the measures have densities on closed submanifolds. Precisely, it is shown that if two probability measures $\mu$ and $\mu^\star$ have $\beta$-smooth densities with respect to the volume measure of some submanifolds $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{M}^\star$ respectively, then the H\"older IPMs $d_{\mathcal{H}^\gamma_1}$ of smoothness $\gamma\geq 1$ and $d_{\mathcal{H}^\eta_1}$ of smoothness $\eta&gt;\gamma$, satisfy $d_{ \mathcal{H}_1^{\gamma}}(\mu,\mu^\star)\lesssim d_{ \mathcal{H}_1^{\eta}}(\mu,\mu^\star)^\frac{\beta+\gamma}{\beta+\eta}$, up to logarithmic factors. We provide an application of this result to high-dimensional inference. These functional inequalities turn out to be a key tool for density estimation on unknown submanifold. In particular, it allows to build the first estimator attaining optimal rates of estimation for all the distances $d_{\mathcal{H}_1^\gamma}$, $\gamma \in [1,\infty)$ simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Separate Exchangeability as Modeling Principle in Bayesian Nonparametrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.07755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue for the use of separate exchangeability as a modeling principle in Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) inference. Separate exchangeability is \emph{de facto} widely applied in the Bayesian parametric case, e.g., it naturally arises in simple mixed models. However, while in some areas, such as random graphs, separate and (closely related) joint exchangeability are widely used, it is curiously underused for several other applications in BNP. We briefly review the definition of separate exchangeability focusing on the implications of such a definition in Bayesian modeling. We then discuss two tractable classes of models that implement separate exchangeability that are the natural counterparts of familiar partially exchangeable BNP models.
  The first is nested random partitions for a data matrix, defining a partition of columns and nested partitions of rows, nested within column clusters. Many recent models for nested partitions implement partially exchangeable models related to variations of the well-known nested Dirichlet process. We argue that inference under such models in some cases ignores important features of the experimental setup. We obtain the separately exchangeable counterpart of such partially exchangeable partition structures.
  The second class is about setting up separately exchangeable priors for a nonparametric regression model when multiple sets of experimental units are involved. We highlight how a Dirichlet process mixture of linear models known as ANOVA DDP can naturally implement separate exchangeability in such regression problems. Finally, we illustrate how to perform inference under such models in two real data examples.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scaling Results for Moreau-Yosida Metropolis-adjusted Langevin Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed class of MCMC methods which uses proximity maps instead of gradients to build proposal mechanisms which can be employed for both differentiable and non-differentiable targets. These methods have been shown to be stable for a wide class of targets, making them a valuable alternative to Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithms (MALA); and have found wide application in imaging contexts. The wider stability properties are obtained by building the Moreau-Yosida envelope for the target of interest, which depends on a parameter $\lambda$. In this work, we investigate the optimal scaling problem for this class of algorithms, which encompasses MALA, and provide practical guidelines for the implementation of these methods.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Monte Carlo Significance Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo significance tests are a general tool that produce p-values by generating samples from the null distribution. However, Monte Carlo tests are limited to null hypothesis which we can exactly sample from. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) significance tests are a way to produce statistical valid p-values for null hypothesis we can only approximately sample from. These methods were first introduced by Besag and Clifford in 1989 and make no assumptions on the mixing time of the MCMC procedure. Here we review the two methods of Besag and Clifford and introduce a new method that unifies the existing procedures. We use simple examples to highlight the difference between MCMC significance tests and standard Monte Carlo tests based on exact sampling. We also survey a range of contemporary applications in the literature including goodness-of-fit testing for the Rasch model, tests for detecting gerrymandering [8] and a permutation based test of conditional independence [3].</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of an over-parametrized Transformer classifier learned by gradient descent</title>

Abstract: One of the most recent and fascinating breakthroughs in artificial intelligence is ChatGPT, a chatbot which can simulate human conversation. ChatGPT is an instance of GPT4, which is a language model based on generative gredictive gransformers. So if one wants to study from a theoretical point of view, how powerful such artificial intelligence can be, one approach is to consider transformer networks and to study which problems one can solve with these networks theoretically. Here it is not only important what kind of models these network can approximate, or how they can generalize their knowledge learned by choosing the best possible approximation to a concrete data set, but also how well optimization of such transformer network based on concrete data set works. In this article we consider all these three different aspects simultaneously and show a theoretical upper bound on the missclassification probability of a transformer network fitted to the observed data. For simplicity we focus in this context on transformer encoder networks which can be applied to define an estimate in the context of a classification problem involving natural language.</description>

      <title>Top-$K$ ranking with a monotone adversary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the top-$K$ ranking problem with a monotone adversary. We consider the scenario where a comparison graph is randomly generated and the adversary is allowed to add arbitrary edges. The statistician's goal is then to accurately identify the top-$K$ preferred items based on pairwise comparisons derived from this semi-random comparison graph. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a weighted maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that achieves near-optimal sample complexity, up to a $\log^2(n)$ factor, where $n$ denotes the number of items under comparison. This is made possible through a combination of analytical and algorithmic innovations. On the analytical front, we provide a refined~$\ell_\infty$ error analysis of the weighted MLE that is more explicit and tighter than existing analyses. It relates the~$\ell_\infty$ error with the spectral properties of the weighted comparison graph. Motivated by this, our algorithmic innovation involves the development of an SDP-based approach to reweight the semi-random graph and meet specified spectral properties. Additionally, we propose a first-order method based on the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) framework. This method efficiently solves the resulting SDP in nearly-linear time relative to the size of the semi-random comparison graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning combines the expressiveness of data-based approaches with the interpretability of physical models. In this context, we consider a general regression problem where the empirical risk is regularized by a partial differential equation that quantifies the physical inconsistency. We prove that for linear differential priors, the problem can be formulated as a kernel regression task. Taking advantage of kernel theory, we derive convergence rates for the minimizer of the regularized risk and show that it converges at least at the Sobolev minimax rate. However, faster rates can be achieved, depending on the physical error. This principle is illustrated with a one-dimensional example, supporting the claim that regularizing the empirical risk with physical information can be beneficial to the statistical performance of estimators.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of the Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm with Sparse Cost Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix scaling problems with sparse cost matrices arise frequently in various domains, such as optimal transport, image processing, and machine learning. The Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm is a popular iterative method for solving these problems, but its convergence properties in the presence of sparsity have not been thoroughly analyzed. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm specifically for sparse cost matrices. We derive novel bounds on the convergence rate that explicitly depend on the sparsity pattern and the degree of nonsparsity of the cost matrix. These bounds provide new insights into the behavior of the algorithm and highlight the potential for exploiting sparsity to develop more efficient solvers. We also explore connections between our sparse convergence results and existing convergence results for dense matrices, showing that our bounds generalize the dense case. Our analysis reveals that the convergence rate improves as the matrix becomes less sparse and as the minimum entry of the cost matrix increases relative to its maximum entry. These findings have important practical implications, suggesting that the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm may be particularly well-suited for large-scale matrix scaling problems with sparse cost matrices arising in real-world applications. Future research directions include investigating tighter bounds based on more sophisticated sparsity patterns, developing algorithm variants that actively exploit sparsity, and empirically validating the benefits of our theoretical results on real-world datasets. This work advances our understanding of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for an important class of matrix scaling problems and lays the foundation for designing more efficient and scalable solutions in practice.</description>

      <title>Contextual Continuum Bandits: Static Versus Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the contextual continuum bandits problem, where the learner sequentially receives a side information vector and has to choose an action in a convex set, minimizing a function associated to the context. The goal is to minimize all the underlying functions for the received contexts, leading to a dynamic (contextual) notion of regret, which is stronger than the standard static regret. Assuming that the objective functions are H\"older with respect to the contexts, we demonstrate that any algorithm achieving a sub-linear static regret can be extended to achieve a sub-linear dynamic regret. We further study the case of strongly convex and smooth functions when the observations are noisy. Inspired by the interior point method and employing self-concordant barriers, we propose an algorithm achieving a sub-linear dynamic regret. Lastly, we present a minimax lower bound, implying two key facts. First, no algorithm can achieve sub-linear dynamic regret over functions that are not continuous with respect to the context. Second, for strongly convex and smooth functions, the algorithm that we propose achieves, up to a logarithmic factor, the minimax optimal rate of dynamic regret as a function of the number of queries.</description>
