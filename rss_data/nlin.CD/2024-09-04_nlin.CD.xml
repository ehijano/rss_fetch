      <title>Chaotic uncertainty and statistical inference for natural chaotic systems: Choosing predictors for multiple season ahead prediction of precipitation, Extended and Annotated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we define natural chaotic systems, like the earths weather and climate system, as chaotic systems which are open to the world so have constantly changing boundary conditions, and measurements of their states are subject to errors. In such systems the chaoticity, amplifying error exponentially fast, is so confounded with the boundary condition fluctuations and the measurement error, that it is impossible to consistently estimate the trajectory of the system much less predict it. Although asymptotic theory exists for estimating the conditional predictive distributions, it is hard to find where this theory has been applied. Here the theory is reviewed, and applied to identifying useful predictive variables for simultaneous multiseason prediction of precipitation with potentially useful updating possible. This is done at two locations, one midocean the other landlocked. The method appears to show promise for fast exploration of variables for multiseason prediction.</description>

      <title>Adapting Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Bifurcation Detection in Ecological Migration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the analysis of bifurcation phenomena in ecological migration models. By integrating the fundamental principles of diffusion-advection-reaction equations with deep learning techniques, we address the complexities of species migration dynamics, particularly focusing on the detection and analysis of Hopf bifurcations. Traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often involve intricate calculations and extensive computational resources, which can be restrictive in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, PINNs offer a more flexible and efficient alternative, bypassing the need for grid discretization and allowing for mesh-free solutions. Our approach leverages the DeepXDE framework, which enhances the computational efficiency and applicability of PINNs in solving high-dimensional PDEs. We validate our results against conventional methods and demonstrate that PINNs not only provide accurate bifurcation predictions but also offer deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of diffusion processes. Despite these advantages, the study also identifies challenges such as the high computational costs and the sensitivity of PINN performance to network architecture and hyperparameter settings. Future work will focus on optimizing these algorithms and expanding their application to other complex systems involving bifurcations. The findings from this research have significant implications for the modeling and analysis of ecological systems, providing a powerful tool for predicting and understanding complex dynamical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Data-driven ODE modeling of the high-frequency complex dynamics of a fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper [N. Tsutsumi, K. Nakai and Y. Saiki, Chaos 32, 091101 (2022)], we proposed a method for constructing a system of differential equations of chaotic behavior from only observable deterministic time series, which we call the radial function-based regression (RfR) method. However, when the targeted variable's behavior is rather complex, the direct application of the RfR method does not function well. In this study, we propose a novel method of modeling such dynamics, including the high-frequency intermittent behavior of a fluid flow, by considering another variable (base variable) showing relatively simple, less intermittent behavior. We construct an autonomous joint model composed of two parts: the first is an autonomous system of a base variable, and the other concerns the targeted variable being affected by a term involving the base variable to demonstrate complex dynamics. The constructed joint model succeeded in not only inferring a short trajectory but also reconstructing chaotic sets and statistical properties obtained from a long trajectory such as the density distributions of the actual dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effective transport barriers in the biquadratic nontwist map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nontwist area-preserving maps violate the twist condition at specific orbits, resulting in shearless invariant curves that prevent chaotic transport. Plasmas and fluids with nonmonotonic equilibrium profiles may be described using nontwist systems, where even after these shearless curves breakdown, effective transport barriers persist, partially reducing transport coefficients. Some nontwist systems present multiple shearless curves in phase space, increasing the complexity of transport phenomena, which have not been thoroughly investigated until now. In this work, we examine the formation of effective transport barriers in a nontwist area-preserving mapping with multiple shearless transport barriers. By quantifying the effectiveness of each transport barrier in phase space, we identified two scenarios where particular barriers dominate over others. Our results also reveal configurations where the interplay of two transport barriers creates regions in phase space with significant orbit trapping, thereby influencing the overall transport dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a transition state by excited vibration and impact on the reaction rate in the three-body Lennard-Jones system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-body Lennard-Jones system on the plane has a transition state, which is the straight conformation located at a saddle point of the potential energy landscape. We show that the transition state can be dynamically stabilized by excited vibration of particle distances. The stabilization mechanism is explained theoretically, and is verified by performing molecular dynamics simulations. We also examine whether the dynamical stabilization gives an impact on the reaction rate between the two isomers of equilateral triangle conformations by comparing with the transition state theory.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Star Motifs: Network Response to Link Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding efficient modifications to improve network functionality is a fundamental problem of scientific and industrial interest. We study the response of network dynamics against link modifications on a weakly connected directed graph consisting of two strongly connected components: an undirected star and an undirected cycle. We assume that there are directed edges starting from the cycle and ending at the star (master-slave formalism). We modify the graph by adding directed edges of arbitrarily large weights starting from the star and ending at the cycle (opposite direction of the cutset). We provide criteria (based on the sizes of the star and cycle, the coupling structure, and the weights of cutset and modification edges) that determine how the modification affects the spectral gap of the Laplacian matrix. We apply our approach to understand the modifications that either enhance or hinder synchronization in networks of chaotic Lorenz systems as well as R\"ossler. Our results show that the hindrance of collective dynamics due to link additions is not atypical as previously anticipated by modification analysis and thus allows for better control of collective properties.</description>

      <title>The topology of a chaotic attractor in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Birman-Williams theorem gives a connection between the collection of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) contained within a chaotic attractor and the topology of that attractor, for three-dimensional systems. In certain cases, the fractal dimension of a chaotic attractor in a partial differential equation (PDE) is less than three, even though that attractor is embedded within an infinite-dimensional space. Here we study the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE at the onset of chaos. We use two different dimensionality-reduction techniques - proper orthogonal decomposition and an autoencoder neural network - to find two different approximate embeddings of the chaotic attractor into three dimensions. By finding the projection of the attractor's UPOs in these reduced spaces and examining their linking numbers, we construct templates for the branched manifold which encodes the topological properties of the attractor. The templates obtained using two different dimensionality reduction methods mirror each other. Hence, the organization of the periodic orbits is identical (up to a global change of sign) and consistent symbolic names for low-period UPOs are derived. This is strong evidence that the dimensional reduction is robust, in this case, and that an accurate topological characterization of the chaotic attractor of the chaotic PDE has been achieved.</description>

      <title>Quantifying predictability and basin structure in infinite-dimensional delayed systems: a stochastic basin entropy approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mackey-Glass system is a paradigmatic example of a delayed model whose dynamics is particularly complex due to, among other factors, its multistability involving the coexistence of many periodic and chaotic attractors. The prediction of the long-term dynamics is especially challenging in these systems, where the dimensionality is infinite and initial conditions must be specified as a function in a finite time interval. In this paper we extend the recently proposed basin entropy to randomly sample arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces. By complementing this stochastic approach with the basin fraction of the attractors in the initial conditions space we can understand the structure of the basins of attraction and how they are intermixed. The results reported here allow us to quantify the predictability and provide indicators of the presence of bifurcations. The tools employed can result very useful in the study of complex systems of infinite dimension.</description>

      <title>Chaotic measures as an alternative to spectral measures for analysing turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09885v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence has associated chaotic features. In the past couple of decades there has been growing interest in the study of these features as an alternative means of understanding turbulent systems. Our own input to this effort has been in contributing to the initial studies of chaos in Eulerian flow using direct numerical simulation (DNS). In this review we discuss the progress achieved in the turbulence community in understanding chaotic measures including our own work. A central relation between turbulence and chaos is one by Ruelle that connects the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the Reynolds number. The first DNS studies, ours amongst them, in obtaining this relation has shown the viability of chaotic simulation studies of Eulerian flow. Such chaotic measures and associated simulation methodology provides an alternative means to probe turbulent flow. Building on this, we have analyzed the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) and studied its fluctuations, and found that chaotic measures could be quantified accurately even at small simulation box sizes where for comparative sizes spectral measures would be inconclusive. We further highlight applications of chaotic measures in analyzing phase transition behavior in turbulent flow and two dimensional thin layer turbulent systems. This work has shown chaotic measures are an excellent tool that can be used alongside spectral measures in studying turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Periodic classical trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic passage in systems of interacting bosons is substantially affected by interactions and inter-particle entanglement. We consider STIRAP-like schemes in Bose-Hubbard chains that exhibit low-dimensional chaos (a 3 site chain), and high-dimensional chaos (more than 3 sites). The dynamics that is generated by a transfer protocol exhibits striking classical and quantum chaos fingerprints that are manifest in the mean-field classical treatment, in the truncated-Wigner semiclassical treatment, and in the full many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal training of finitely-sampled quantum reservoir computers for forecasting of chaotic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the presence of noise deteriorates the performance of quantum computing algorithms. Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) is a type of Quantum Machine Learning algorithm, which, however, can benefit from different types of tuned noise. In this paper, we analyse the effect that finite-sampling noise has on the chaotic time-series prediction capabilities of QRC and Recurrence-free Quantum Reservoir Computing (RF-QRC). First, we show that, even without a recurrent loop, RF-QRC contains temporal information about previous reservoir states using leaky integrated neurons. This makes RF-QRC different from Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELM). Second, we show that finite sampling noise degrades the prediction capabilities of both QRC and RF-QRC while affecting QRC more due to the propagation of noise. Third, we optimize the training of the finite-sampled quantum reservoir computing framework using two methods: (a) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) applied to the data matrix containing noisy reservoir activation states; and (b) data-filtering techniques to remove the high-frequencies from the noisy reservoir activation states. We show that denoising reservoir activation states improve the signal-to-noise ratios with smaller training loss. Finally, we demonstrate that the training and denoising of the noisy reservoir activation signals in RF-QRC are highly parallelizable on multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) as compared to the QRC architecture with recurrent connections. The analyses are numerically showcased on prototypical chaotic dynamical systems with relevance to turbulence. This work opens opportunities for using quantum reservoir computing with finite samples for time-series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Embedding classic chaotic maps in simple discrete-time memristor circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years the literature has witnessed a remarkable surge of interest for chaotic maps implemented by discrete-time (DT) memristor circuits. This paper investigates on the reasons underlying this type of chaotic behavior. To this end, the papers considers the map implemented by the simplest memristor circuit given by a capacitor and an ideal flux-controlled memristor or an inductor and an ideal charge-controlled memristor. In particular, the manuscript uses the DT flux-charge analysis method (FCAM) introduced in a recent paper to ensure that the first integrals and foliation in invariant manifolds of continuous-time (CT) memristor circuits are preserved exactly in the discretization for any step size. DT-FCAM yields a two-dimensional map in the voltage-current domain (VCD) and a manifold-dependent one-dimensional map in the flux-charge domain (FCD), i.e., a one-dimensional map on each invariant manifold. One main result is that, for suitable choices of the circuit parameters and memristor nonlinearities, both DT circuits can exactly embed two classic chaotic maps, i.e., the logistic map and the tent map. Moreover, due to the property of extreme multistability, the DT circuits can simultaneously embed in the manifolds all the dynamics displayed by varying one parameter in the logistic and tent map. The paper then considers a DT memristor Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua circuit and its dual. Via DT-FCAM these circuits implement a three-dimensional map in the VCD and a two-dimensional map on each invariant manifold in the FCD. It is shown that both circuits can simultaneously embed in the manifolds all the dynamics displayed by two other classic chaotic maps, i.e., the Henon map and the Lozi map, when varying one parameter in such maps. In essence, these results provide an explanation of why it is not surprising to observe complex dynamics even in simple DT memristor circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.07283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically kicked Floquet systems such as the kicked rotor are a paradigmatic and illustrative simple model of chaos. For non-integrable quantum dynamics there are several diagnostic measures of the presence of (or the transition to) chaotic behaviour including the Loschmidt echo, autocorrelation function and OTOC. We analytically compute these measures in terms of the eigensystem of the unitary Floquet operator of driven quantum systems. We use these expressions to determine the time variation of the measures for the quantum kicked rotor on the torus, for the integrable as well as the chaotic case. For a simpler integrable variant of the kicked rotor, we also give a representation theoretic derivation of its dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The complexity of quantum states under dynamical evolution can be investigated by studying the spread with time of the state over a pre-defined basis. It is known that this complexity is minimised by choosing the Krylov basis, thus defining the spread complexity. We study the dynamics of spread complexity for quantum maps using the Arnoldi iterative procedure. The main illustrative quantum many-body model we use is the periodically kicked Ising spin-chain with non-integrable deformations, a chaotic system where we look at both local and non-local interactions. In the various cases we find distinctive behaviour of the Arnoldi coefficients and spread complexity for regular vs. chaotic dynamics: suppressed fluctuations in the Arnoldi coefficients as well as larger saturation value in spread complexity in the chaotic case. We compare the behaviour of the Krylov measures with that of standard spectral diagnostics of chaos. We also study the effect of changing the driving frequency on the complexity saturation.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>

Abstract: We show that magnetic reconnection and topology-change can be understood, and distinguished, in terms of trajectories of Alfv\'enic wave-packets ${\bf x}(t)$ moving along the magnetic field ${\bf B(x}, t)$ with Alfv\'en velocity $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf V}_A({\bf x},t)$, i.e. adopting a Lagrangian formalism for virtual particles. A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by directly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without appealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines moving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\'enic trajectories correspond to the dynamical system $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf B}$, where $\bf B$ solves the induction equation, with phase space $(\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of this phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby wave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\pm \delta t$, unless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions for magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories, i.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change magnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry breaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of Alfv\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, trajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent diffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its reformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.</description>
