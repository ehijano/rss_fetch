      <title>A generalization of the hexastix arrangement to higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexastix is an arrangement of non-overlapping infinite hexagonal prisms in four different directions that cover $\frac{3}{4}$ of space. We consider a possible generalization to $n$ dimensions, based on the permutohedral lattice $A^*_n$. The central lines of the generalized prisms are going to be oriented in $n+1$ different directions (parallel to the shortest non-zero vectors of $A^*_n$). The projection of the lines oriented in any direction along that direction to a hyperplane perpendicular to it is required to be a translation of the corresponding projection of $A^*_n$, and the minimal distance between lines oriented in any two given directions should be maximal. It is shown that this is possible if $n$ is a prime power. Also, the proportion of $n$-space that is covered is calculated for $n \in \{4, 5\}$, and an alternative generalization is briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Uniform Consistency of Generalized Fr\'echet Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Fr\'echet mean on metric spaces, which we call $\phi$-means. Our generalization is indexed by a convex function $\phi$. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for $\phi$-means to be finite and provide a tight bound for the diameter of the intrinsic mean set. We also provide sufficient conditions under which all the $\phi$-means coincide in a single point. Then, we prove the consistency of the sample $\phi$-mean to its population analogue. We also find conditions under which classes of $\phi$-means converge uniformly, providing a Glivenko-Cantelli result. Finally, we illustrate applications of our results and provide algorithms for the computation of $\phi$-means.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for the existence of packing asymptotics on linear sets of Lebesgue measure zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a characterization of Minkowski measurability to study the asymptotics of best packing on cut-out subsets of the real line with Minkowski dimension $d\in(0,1)$. Our main result is a proof that Minkowski measurability is a sufficient condition for the existence of best packing asymptotics on monotone rearrangements of these sets. For each such set, the main result provides an explicit constant of proportionality $p_d,$ depending only on the Minkowski dimension $d,$ that relates its packing limit and Minkowski content. We later use the Digamma function to study the limiting value of $p_d$ as $d\to 1^-.$ For sharpness, we use renewal theory to prove that the packing constant of the $(1/2,1/3)$ Cantor set is less than the product of its Minkowski content and $p_d$. We also show that the measurability hypothesis of the main theorem is necessary by demonstrating that a monotone rearrangement of the complementary intervals of the 1/3 Cantor set has Minkowski dimension $d=\log2/\log3\in(0,1),$ is not Minkowski measurable, and does not have convergent first-order packing asymptotics. The aforementioned characterization of Minkowski measurability further motivates the asymptotic study of an infinite multiple subset sum problem.</description>

      <title>The perimeter and volume of a Reuleaux polyhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ball polyhedron is the intersection of a finite number of closed balls in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the same radius. In this note, we study ball polyhedra in which the set of centers defining the balls have the maximum possible number of diametric pairs. We explain how to compute the perimeter and volume of these shapes by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and another integral formula. In addition, we show how to adapt this method to approximate the volume of Meissner polyhedra, which are constant width bodies constructed from ball polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Pushforward of currents under Sobolev maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a Sobolev map from a Riemannian manifold into a complete metric space pushes forward almost every compactly supported integral current to an Ambrosio--Kirchheim integral current in the metric target, where "almost every" is understood in a modulus sense.
  As an application, we prove that when the target supports an isoperimetric inequality of Euclidean type for integral currents, an isoperimetric inequality for Sobolev mappings relative to bounded, closed and additive cochains follows.
  Using the results above, we answer positively to an open question by Onninen and Pankka on sharp H\"older continuity for quasiregular curves. A key tool in the continuity proof is Almgren's isoperimetric inequality for integral currents.</description>

      <title>Transcendence and normality of complex numbers via Hurwitz continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological, dynamical, and descriptive set theoretic properties of Hurwitz continued fractions. Hurwitz continued fractions associate an infinite sequence of Gaussian integers to every complex number which is not a Gaussian rational. The resulting space of sequences of Gaussian integers $\Omega$ is not closed. By means of an algorithm, we show that $\Omega$ contains a natural subset whose closure $\overline{\mathsf{R}}$ encodes continued fraction expansions of complex numbers which are not Gaussian rationals. We prove that $(\overline{\mathsf{R}}, \sigma)$ is a subshift with a feeble specification property. As an application, we determine the rank in the Borel hierarchy of the set of Hurwitz normal numbers with respect to the complex Gauss measure. We also construct a family of complex transcendental numbers with bounded partial quotients.</description>
