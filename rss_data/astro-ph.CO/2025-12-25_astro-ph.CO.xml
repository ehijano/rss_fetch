      <title>Thawing Quintessence: Priors, evidence, and likely trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian comparison between thawing quintessence and a cosmological constant, incorporating theoretically motivated priors on the phenomenological Pad\'e-w parameters used to model thawing dynamics. We find that thawing quintessence is consistently preferred over a cosmological constant when combining BAO data from DESI DR2 and CMB data from Planck+ACT with any of the major supernova compilations, including the recently updated DES-Dovekie sample. This preference is not sensitive to our choice of prior, but it is contingent on the inclusion of supernovae in the analysis. We comment on the consistency between various information criteria and Bayesian evidence ratios, finding that the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) tracks the Bayesian evidence more reliably than either the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, we use observational likelihoods to identify which thawing trajectories are compatible with the available data, independently of theoretical priors.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Mass Step: Environmental Dependence of Type Ia Supernovae in Low-Metallicity Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous impact of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the field of cosmology, their underlying physics are still poorly understood. Studies have found an intriguing correlation between standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities and host galaxy masses, commonly referred to as the "mass step". SNe Ia in massive galaxies appear systematically brighter than in lower-mass, star-forming hosts after standardization. However, previous analyses use host galaxy mass estimates derived largely from optical data alone and assume parametric forms for host star formation histories (SFHs), both of which are known to misestimate galaxy stellar masses. In this work, we re-examine the mass-step relation with a sample of SN Ia host galaxies complete in broadband optical (3000 Angstrom to 1 micron) and near-infrared (up to 1.8 micron) data, and in some cases including mid-infrared observations (up to 4.5 micron), using Prospector to derive nonparametric SFHs. We find that while the masses for these galaxies have indeed been underestimated, the overall trend in SN Ia luminosity versus host mass remains largely unchanged. We also uncover an environmental metallicity-dependent trend, in which low-metallicity galaxies (Z &lt; -1 Zsol) may drive much of the observed SN Ia luminosity-mass correlation, suggesting that the chemical composition of the SN environment plays a central role in shaping the standardized brightness of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>A novel sub-grid model for super-Eddington accretion of spinning black holes in galaxy-scale simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19281v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion has been proposed to explain the existence of black holes (BHs) with masses exceeding a billion solar masses within the first billion years after the Big Bang. We present a novel accretion disc-based sub-grid model for BH mass and spin evolution in the super-Eddington regime, implemented in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO. In our model, motivated by results of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion discs, the growth of the BH is mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc, comprising an inner photon-trapping region described by simulation-based fitting formulae and an outer thin $\alpha$-disc with three regions. We incorporate a self-consistent spin evolution prescription that transitions between the Bardeen-Petterson effect and inner thick-disc precession, depending on the accretion rate. We perform a suite of idealised simulations of a BH embedded in a gaseous circumnuclear disc and a spherically distributed stellar component to explore the conditions under which super-Eddington accretion can be sustained in the environment of a realistic galactic nucleus. Simulations with misaligned gas inflows onto an initially aligned BH-disc system yield very high Eddington ratios, triggered by the rapid removal of disc angular momentum via inflows. These results highlight the importance of angular momentum misalignment in enabling super-Eddington accretion and suggest that such episodes are difficult to trigger unless the system resides in a highly dynamical environment -- a condition more likely to occur in high-redshift galaxies. Our model potentially provides a way to grow moderate-mass BH seeds to the sizes required to explain the bright high-redshift quasars.</description>

      <title>Quirks Live in Cool Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that cosmological observations place strong bounds on the reheat temperature $T_\text{RH}$ of the Standard Model (SM) in minimal models of `quirks' -- heavy fermions transforming under the SM gauge group together with a new non-Abelian gauge interaction with a confinement scale far below the mass of the fermions. These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T_\text{RH} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $\gamma$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T_\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>Echoes of $R^3$ modification and Goldstone preheating in the CMB-BAO landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $R^2$ and the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation are disfavored by the observed high spectral index $n_s$ from the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at the $\sim2\sigma$ level. The addition of a dimension-six $R^3$ term in the action helps alleviate this tension. We show that the parameter space accounting for the observed high $n_s$ also induces rapid Goldstone and Higgs preheating. The preheating, especially from Goldstone modes, helps match the CMB and inflationary scales, which in turn supports the observed $n_s$.</description>

      <title>Mid-IR luminosity functions: inferred dusty cosmic star-formation and black hole accretion histories from the JWST SMILES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, tracing star formation, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity via dust emission. This work presents mid-IR galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 6$, derived from the JWST Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. We combine 8 MIRI bands ($5-25$ $\mu$m) of SMILES and archival 23-band HST+JWST NIRCam photometry to construct an extensive catalog containing 2,813 galaxies with sub-$\mu$Jy level completeness in the mid-IR. We obtain monochromatic (in 5.6, 7.7, 10, 12.8, 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 $\mu$m), $L_{\rm IR}$, and AGN LFs, with a limiting luminosity down to $10^{9.5}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=0.5-1.0$, $\sim10^{10.5}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=2.0-4.0$, and to $\sim10^{11}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=4.0-6.0$. With the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST, here we better constrain the faint-end slope and its evolution of the mid-IR LFs, quantifying the dusty cosmic star formation and black hole accretion histories out to $z \sim 5$. These results provide essential insights to refine our understanding of the obscured star formation and galaxy-AGN co-evolution over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation Driven by Non-Thermal Squeezing Through SNS and CSNS Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in a spatially flat FRW Universe for two fundamental nonclassical states: the Squeezed Number State (SNS) and the Coherent Squeezed Number State (CSNS). Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $\rho$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $\rho$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $\Delta \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $\Delta \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations. These findings contribute a new perspective on gravitational particle creation in cosmological settings.</description>

      <title>Acetaldehyde as a molecule for testing variations of electron-to-proton mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the quantum-mechanical calculations of the dimensionless sensitivity coefficients Q to small changes in the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - for a number of low-frequency (1-50 GHz) transitions of the acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) molecule. The calculations show that Q varies in the range from 0.62 to 3.61. An example of the practical use of the CH3CHO and CH3OH lines tracing the same regions in three molecular clouds, located at large galactocentric distances (D_GC ~ 8 kpc) is considered. This results in a limit on the mu variations of Delta mu/mu = (0.1 +/- 0.4)*10^(-7) which is in line with previously obtained most stringent upper limits on changes in mu based on other molecules and methods. The limit obtained restricts hypothetical violations of the Einstein principle of the local position invariance at the level of 4*10^(-8) in the Galactic disk at large galactocentric distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields, focusing on the evolution of the photon intensity and polarizations induced by conversion into axions. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields characterized by the power spectra of their helical/non-helical components, we express the expectation values and variances of the photon intensity and linear/circular polarizations after conversion in terms of these spectra. We find nontrivial dependencies of these statistical quantities on the characteristic magnetic field correlation length, the propagation distance, and the axion mass. Moreover, we find that nontrivial polarizations emerge even if the photons are initially unpolarized, that the variances of these observables become suppressed in specific frequency regions, and that a peak structure arises in the expectation value of the circular polarization in the presence of statistically helical magnetic fields. We also point out consistency relations among these statistical quantities that hold independently of the specific forms of the magnetic field power spectra.</description>

      <title>Large lepton asymmetry from axion inflation and helium abundance hinted by ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of helical magnetic fields and the associated chiral asymmetry via the chiral anomaly is a generic feature in pseudoscalar inflation. In the presence of a Chern--Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT.</description>

      <title>Acoustic gravitational waves from primordial curvature perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard perturbative calculations of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) have neglected nonperturbative effects in the large-amplitude regime. We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>(Lovelock)$^2$ inflation: explaining the ACT data and equivalence to Higgs-Gauss-Bonnet inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Starobinsky model of inflation in light of recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which indicates a potential preference for a slightly larger scalar spectral index $n_s$ than predicted by the standard $R^2$ scenario. We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\frac{\alpha}{4}{\cal G}$ ($\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $\alpha$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities. This work establishes the quadratic $f(L)$ gravity as a compelling and physically motivated extension that preserves the successes of Starobinsky inflation while improving its fit to modern precision cosmological data.</description>

Abstract: We construct a gravitational open extension of the effective field theory of inflation in the Schwinger-Keldysh framework. While physical symmetries allow many open operators in the Schwinger-Keldysh action, most of them overconstrain the equations of motion, yielding inconsistent dynamics. We identify the minimal open operators compatible with propagating scalar and tensor modes and build the gravitational action, recovering dissipative models of inflation.</description>

This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian reconstruction of primordial perturbations from induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.</description>

      <title>21 cm Signal from the Thermal Evolution of Lyman-$\alpha$ during Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyman-$\alpha$ photons couple the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen (HI) to the kinetic temperature during the era of cosmic dawn. During this process, they also exchange energy with the medium, heating and cooling the HI. In addition, we expect X-ray photons to heat the mostly neutral gas during this era. We solve this coupled system (Lyman-$\alpha$-HI system along with X-ray heating) for a period of 500 Myr (redshift range $8 &lt;z &lt; 25$). Our main results are: (a) Without X-ray heating, the temperature of the gas reaches an equilibrium which is nearly independent of photon intensity and only weakly dependent on the expansion of the universe. The main determinant of the quasi-static temperature is the ratio of injected and continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons. (b) While X-ray photons provide an additional source of heating at initial times, for large enough Lyman-$\alpha$ photon intensity, the system tends to reach the same quasi-static temperature as expected without additional heating. This limit is reached when the density of photons close to the Lyman-$\alpha$ resonance far exceeds the HI number density. (c) We compute the global HI signal for these scenarios. In the limit of the large density of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, the spin temperature of the hyperfine line is fixed. This freezes the global HI signal from the era of cosmic dawn and the cross-over redshift from absorption to emission. This feature depends only on the ratio of injected to continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, and the global HI signal can help us determine this ratio.</description>

      <title>Can cosmic rotation resolve the Hubble tension? Constraints from CMB and large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a relativistic cosmological model with background rotation, sourced by a non-perfect fluid with anisotropic stress. A modified version of the CLASS Boltzmann code is employed to perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain analyses against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and late-time datasets. The results show that current CMB data constrain the present-day rotation parameter to be negligible. As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3 measurement. Combining CMB, SNe and BAO data confirms the preference for non-rotation.</description>

      <title>From ANN to BNN: Inferring Reionization Parameters using Uncertainty-aware Emulators of 21-cm Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring astrophysical parameters from radio interferometric observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a challenging yet crucial task. The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be highly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g., bispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for a varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many times, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge, many artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced, which produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN emulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus, they fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline, they cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated model parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural network (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the posterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their prediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference pipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock observation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW observation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty for the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the inference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced the training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN outperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a summary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using model-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) using the arbitrary redshift pivot Pad\'e-(2,1) expansion methodology developed in arXiv:2509.16196. This approach allows us to constrain cosmography parameters and test CDDR at any redshift. Further, it does not rely on data reconstructions or extrapolations of the cosmography parameters to higher redshifts. We employ observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation dataset, cosmic chronometers (CC), and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus (PP) and Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilations. We find no significant deviations from the standard CDDR relation in the range $0\lesssim z \lesssim 1$ when considering DESI$+r_d$ dataset in combination with PP$+$CC and DESY5$+$CC datasets. However, on imposing a Gaussian prior on $M_B \in \mathcal{N}(-19.253, 0.027)$ (instead of treating it as a free parameter) in the dataset combination PP$+$CC, we find CDDR violation at a level of $(3-5)\sigma.$</description>

Abstract: We investigate whether the recent DESI DR2 measurements provide or not evidences for dynamical dark energy by exploring the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model and its extensions with free $\sum m_{\nu}$ and $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Using a comprehensive MCMC analysis with a wide range of cosmological datasets including DESI~DR2 BAO and Ly$\alpha$ data, CMB compressed likelihoods, BBN, cosmic chronometers, and multiple Type~Ia supernova compilations, we assess the statistical preference for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06299v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the recently developed analysis of 16 years of INTEGRAL/SPI data including a dark matter spatial template to derive bounds on dark matter candidates lighter than WIMPs (like sterile neutrinos or axion-like particles) decaying into line or continuum electromagnetic final state channels. The bounds obtained are the strongest to date for dark matter masses between $\sim $60 keV and $\sim$16 MeV experiencing two-body decays producing photon lines.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quartic-divergent vacuum energy poses an ultraviolet (UV) challenge (the cosmological constant problem) in probing the nature of dark energy. Here we try to evaluate the contribution of the vacuum energy to dark energy with a method of the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Then, we explore an effective description via scale decoupling. The parameter spaces suggest that the vacuum energy of active neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV $(10^{-3}$ eV) is expected. The normal ordering neutrinos are preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\Lambda$CDM with Higher-Order GUP Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario, analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2 release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative, which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy description.</description>

      <title>Singular $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</description>
