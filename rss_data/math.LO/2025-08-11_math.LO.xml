      <title>Structural Completeness in bi-IPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show that no extension of bi-intuitionistic logic, except for classical logic, is structurally complete; indeed, none of them are passively structurally complete. A direct proof of active structural completeness is given for some simple systems.</description>

      <title>Extension Monads: Some Structure Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of extension monads, introduced in the 1990s by the second author, in terms of structure results for infinitely many finitary operations and common constructions in varieties or categories of algebras. Specifically, we see that for finite collections of algebras of the same signature there the extension monad operation commutes with the direct product operation, and that the only retractions from an enlargement or extension monad are trivial.</description>

      <title>Isolated d.c.e. degrees and $\Sigma_1$ induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Turing degree is d.c.e. if it contains a set that is the difference of two c.e. sets. A d.c.e. degree $\mathbf{d}$ is isolated by a c.e. degree $\mathbf{a}&lt;\mathbf{d}$ if all c.e. degrees that are below $\mathbf{d}$ are also below $\mathbf{a}$; $\mathbf{d}$ is isolated from above by a c.e. degree $\mathbf{a}&gt;\mathbf{d}$ if all c.e. degrees that are above $\mathbf{d}$ are also above $\mathbf{a}$. In this paper, we study the inductive strength of both isolated and upper isolated d.c.e. degrees from the point of view of reverse recursion theory. We show that (1) $P^{-} + B\Sigma_1 + \text{Exp} \vdash I\Sigma_1 \leftrightarrow$ There is an isolated proper d.c.e. degree below $\mathbf{0}'$; (2) $P^{-} + B\Sigma_1 + \text{Exp} \vdash I\Sigma_1 \leftrightarrow$ There is an upper isolated proper d.c.e. degree below $\mathbf{0}'$.</description>

      <title>Short Hardy fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially algebraic Hardy field extensions of short Hardy fields are short. This is proved in the more general setting of $H$-fields. As an application we extend a theorem of Rosenlicht (1981) by showing that each short asymptotic couple of Hardy type with small derivation is isomorphic to the asymptotic couple of an analytic Hardy field.</description>

      <title>A non-computable c.e. closed subset of $[0,1]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a $\Sigma^0_1$ closed subset of $[0,1]$ that is not homeomorphic to any computably compact space. We show that the index set of c.e. subspaces of $[0,1]$ that admit a computably compact presentation is not arithmetical, as witnessed by subsets of $[0,1]$. The index set result is new for computable Polish spaces in general, not only for those realised as c.e. closed subsets of $[0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Extensive embeddings into Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structures and stationary weak independence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structure (a countably infinite ultrahomogeneous structure). We call an embedding $f : A \to M$ extensive if each automorphism of its image extends to an automorphism of $M$, where the extension map respects composition. We consider which Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structures $M$ have the property that each substructure admits an extensive embedding into $M$. We also consider which Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structures have a stationary weak independence relation (SWIR) as defined by Li, and discuss the relationship between SWIRs and extensive embeddings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I provide a novel geometric axiomatization of the Solovay model. This serves as a vehicle for concise and forcing-free proofs of classical results in the model, as well as a tool for a purely geometric development of the theory of balanced forcing.</description>

      <title>Basic interactive algorithms: Preview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dialog paper offers a preview and provides a foretaste of an upcoming work on the axiomatization of basic interactive algorithms.
  The modern notion of algorithm was elucidated in the 1930s--1950s. It was axiomatized a quarter of a century ago as the notion of ``sequential algorithm'' or ``classical algorithm''; we prefer to call it ``basic algorithm" now. The axiomatization was used to show that for every basic algorithm there is a behaviorally equivalent abstract state machine. It was also used to prove the Church-Turing thesis as it has been understood by the logicians.
  Starting from the 1960s, the notion of algorithm has expanded -- probabilistic algorithms, quantum algorithms, etc. -- prompting introduction of a much more ambitious version of the Church-Turing thesis commonly known as the ``physical thesis.'' We emphasize the difference between the two versions of the Church-Turing thesis and illustrate how nondeterministic and probabilistic algorithms can be viewed as basic algorithms with appropriate oracles. The same view applies to quantum circuit algorithms and many other classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Averages of hypergraphs and higher arity stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that $k$-ary functions giving the measure of the intersection of multi-parametric families of sets in probability spaces, e.g. $(x,y,z) \in X \times Y \times Z \mapsto \mu(P_{x,y} \cap Q_{x,z} \cap R_{y,z})$, satisfy a particularly strong form of hypergraph regularity. More generally, this applies to the (integral) averages of continuous combinations of functions of smaller arity. This result is connected to higher arity stability in model theory, that we discuss in the second part of the paper. We demonstrate that all hypergraphs embedding both into the half-simplex and into $GS(\mathbb{F}_3)$, the two known sources of failure of ternary stability, do satisfy an analogous regularity lemma -- hence strong ternary stability cannot be characterized simply by excluded hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Substitution Basis for the Kalmar Elementary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the class of Kalmar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. We also prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal. Furthermore, we discuss alternative substitution bases under arity constraints.</description>
