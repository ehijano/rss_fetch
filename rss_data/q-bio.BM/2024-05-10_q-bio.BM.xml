      <title>A Review on Fragment-based De Novo 2D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of computational molecule generation, an essential task in the discovery of new chemical compounds, fragment-based deep generative models are a leading approach, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular design benchmarks as of 2023. We present a detailed comparative assessment of their architectures, highlighting their unique approaches to molecular fragmentation and generative modeling. This review also includes comparisons of output quality, generation speed, and the current limitations of specific models. We also highlight promising avenues for future research that could bridge fragment-based models to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>SMARTINI3: Systematic Parametrization of Realistic Multi-Scale Membrane Models via Unsupervised Learning and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize genetic algorithms to develop a realistic implicit solvent ultra-coarse-grained (PC) membrane model comprising only three interaction sites. The key philosophy of the ultra-CG membrane model SMARTINI3 is its compatibility with realistic membrane proteins, for example, modeled within the Martini coarse-grained (CG) model, as well as with the widely used GROMACS software for molecular simulations. Our objective is to parameterize this ultra-CG model to accurately reproduce the experimentally observed structural and thermodynamic properties of PC membranes in real units, including properties such as area per lipid, area compressibility, bending modulus, line tension, phase transition temperature, density profile, and radial distribution function. In our example, we specifically focus on the properties of a POPC membrane, although the developed membrane model could be perceived as a generic model of lipid membranes. To optimize the performance of the model (the fitness), we conduct a series of evolutionary runs with diverse random initial population sizes (ranging from 96 to 384). We demonstrate that the ultra-CG membrane model we developed exhibits authentic lipid membrane behaviors, encompassing self-assembly into bilayers, vesicle formation, membrane fusion, and gel phase formation. Moreover, we demonstrate compatibility with the Martini coarse-grained model by successfully reproducing the behavior of a transmembrane domain embedded within a lipid bilayer. This facilitates the simulation of realistic membrane proteins within an ultra-CG bilayer membrane, enhancing the accuracy and applicability of our model in biophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Inference in Molecular Diffusion Models with Latent Representations of Protein Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for addressing problems in structural biology and structure-based drug design. These models operate directly on 3D molecular structures. Due to the unfavorable scaling of graph neural networks (GNNs) with graph size as well as the relatively slow inference speeds inherent to diffusion models, many existing molecular diffusion models rely on coarse-grained representations of protein structure to make training and inference feasible. However, such coarse-grained representations discard essential information for modeling molecular interactions and impair the quality of generated structures. In this work, we present a novel GNN-based architecture for learning latent representations of molecular structure. When trained end-to-end with a diffusion model for de novo ligand design, our model achieves comparable performance to one with an all-atom protein representation while exhibiting a 3-fold reduction in inference time.</description>

      <title>DDIPrompt: Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction based on Graph Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks have become increasingly prevalent in predicting adverse drug-drug interactions (DDI) due to their proficiency in modeling the intricate associations between atoms and functional groups within and across drug molecules. However, they are still hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the issue of highly imbalanced event distribution, which is a common but critical problem in medical datasets where certain interactions are vastly underrepresented. This imbalance poses a substantial barrier to achieving accurate and reliable DDI predictions. (2) the scarcity of labeled data for rare events, which is a pervasive issue in the medical field where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-studied due to limited available data. In response, we offer DDIPrompt, an innovative panacea inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompting. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt employs augmented links between drugs, considering both structural and interactive proximity. It features a hierarchical pre-training strategy that comprehends intra-molecular structures and inter-molecular interactions, fostering a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of drug properties. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Comprehensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DDIPrompt, particularly in predicting rare DDI events.</description>
