      <title>Synthetic Grid Generator: Synthesizing Large-Scale Power Distribution Grids using Open Street Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, various stakeholders involved in the analysis of electric power distribution grids face difficulties in the data acquisition related to the grid topology and parameters of grid assets. To mitigate the problem and possibly accelerate the accomplishment of grid studies without access to real data, we propose a novel approach for generating synthetic distribution grids (Syngrids) of (almost) arbitrary size replicating the characteristics of real medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. The method enables large-scale testing without incurring the burden of retrieving and pre-processing real-world data. The proposed algorithm exploits the publicly available information of Open Street Map (OSM). By leveraging geospatial data of real buildings and road networks, the approach allows to construct a Syngrid of chosen size with realistic topology and electrical parameters. It is shown that typical power-flow and short-circuit calculations can be performed on Syngrids ensuring convergence. Within the context of validating the effectiveness of the algorithm and the meaningful similarity of the output to real grids, the topological and electrical characteristics of a Syngrid are compared to their real-world counterparts. Finally, an open-source web platform named as Synthetic Grid Generator (SGG) and based on the proposed algorithm can be used by various stakeholders for the creation of synthetic grids.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive System Architecture using Field Programmable Gate Arrays Technology, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Edge Computing for Emergency Response in Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient emergency response systems are crucial for smart cities. But their implementation is highly challenging, particularly in regions like Chad where infrastructural constraints are prevalent. The urgency for optimized response times and resource allocation in emergency scenarios is magnified in these contexts, yet existing solutions often assume robust infrastructure and uninterrupted connectivity, which is not always available. Most of the time, they are based on system architectures pre-designed for other purposes. This paper addresses these critical challenges by proposing a comprehensive system architecture that integrates Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Dijkstra's algorithm, and Edge Computing. The objective is to enhance emergency response through accelerated route planning and resource allocation, addressing gaps left by traditional cloud-based systems. Methodologically, key characteristics of the desired system are identified, then its components are described and their integration is explained; the system leverages FPGA-based computations and a distributed implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths rapidly, while Edge Computing ensures decentralized and resilient processing. A theoretical analysis highlights promising improvements in response times and resource management. The proposed system architecture not only enhances emergency response efficiency but is also adaptable to infrastructural constraints of Chadian-like environments.</description>

      <title>Robust Backstepping Control of a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Under Colored Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in software, sensor and microprocessor technologies have facilitated the production of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles are used in important missions such as search and rescue,fight against terrorism, fire fighting, surveillance and cargo transportation. While performing these tasks, Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles will have to operate in noisy environments that are not ideal. For this reason, a robust controller design that can control the altitude and position angles of the quadrotor in noisy environments is of great importance. In this research, firstly, a nonlinear model of the quadrotor was created using MATLAB software. Then, a backstepping controller design that is resistant to colored noises was realized. The designed backstepping controller was tested under white Gaussian noise, pink noise, brown noise, blue noise and purple noise. In addition, PID controller design and Lyapunov-based controller design were also carried out and their performances were compared with the backstepping controller. A comparative robustness analysis was performed by obtaining overshoot, rise time and settling time data of all three controllers. When the data obtained was examined, it was proven that the proposed backstepping controller had the least overshoot and shortest settling time under all noise types.</description>

      <title>Modeling Transit in a Fully Integrated Agent-Based Framework: Methodology and Large-Scale Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a transit routing, assignment, and simulation framework which is fully embedded in a multimodal, multi-agent transportation demand and supply modeling platform. POLARIS, a high-performance agent-based simulation platform, efficiently integrates advanced travel and freight demand modeling, dynamic traffic and transit assignment, and multimodal transportation simulation within a unified framework. We focus on POLARIS's transit routing, assignment, and simulation components, detailing its structural design and essential terminologies. We demonstrate how the model integrates upstream decision-making processes - activity generation, location and timing choices, and mode selection, particularly for transit-inclusive trips - followed by routing, assignment decisions, and the movement of travelers and vehicles within a multimodal network. This integration enables modeling of interactions among all agents, including travelers, vehicles, and transportation service providers. The study reviews literature on transportation system modeling tools, describes the transit modeling framework within POLARIS, and presents findings from large-scale analyses of various policy interventions. Results from numerical experiments reveal that measures such as congestion pricing, transit service improvements, first-mile-last-mile subsidies, increased e-commerce deliveries, and vehicle electrification significantly impact transit ridership, with some interactions between these levers exhibiting synergistic or canceling effects. The case study underscores the necessity of integrating transit modeling within a broader multimodal network simulation and decision-making context.</description>

      <title>Efficient Unit Commitment Constraint Screening under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is a fundamental task for power system operators, where generator statuses and power dispatch are determined based on the forecasted nodal net demands. The uncertainty inherent in renewables and load forecasting requires the use of techniques in optimization under uncertainty to find more resilient and reliable UC solutions. However, the solution procedure of such specialized optimization may differ from the deterministic UC. The original constraint screening approach can be unreliable and inefficient for them. Thus, in this work we design a novel screening approach under the forecasting uncertainty. Our approach accommodates such uncertainties in both chance-constrained and robust forms, and can greatly reduce the UC instance size by screening out non-binding constraints. To further improve the screening efficiency, we utilize the multi-parametric programming theory to convert the underlying optimization problem of the screening model to a piecewise affine function. A multi-area screening approach is further developed to handle the computational intractability issues for large-scale problems. We verify the proposed method's performance on a variety of UC setups and uncertainty situations. Experimental results show that our robust screening procedure can guarantee better feasibility, while the CC screening can produce more efficient reduced models. The average screening time for a single line flow constraint can be accelerated by 71.2X to 131.3X using our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Software Architecture for Multi-Robot Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a metal 3D printing technology that deposits molten metal wire on a substrate to form desired geometries. Articulated robot arms are commonly used in WAAM to produce complex geometric shapes. However, they mostly rely on proprietary robot and weld control software that limits process tuning and customization, incorporation of third-party sensors, implementation on robots and weld controllers from multiple vendors, and customizable user programming. This paper presents a general open-source software architecture for WAAM that addresses these limitations. The foundation of this architecture is Robot Raconteur, an open-source control and communication framework that serves as the middleware for integrating robots and sensors from different vendors. Based on this architecture, we developed an end-to-end robotic WAAM implementation that takes a CAD file to a printed WAAM part and evaluates the accuracy of the result. The major components in the architecture include part slicing, robot motion planning, part metrology, in-process sensing, and process tuning. The current implementation is based on Motoman robots and Fronius weld controller, but the approach is applicable to other industrial robots and weld controllers. The capability of the WAAM tested is demonstrated through the printing of parts of various geometries and acquisition of in-process sensor data for motion adjustment.</description>

      <title>Automation Configuration in Smart Home Systems: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the innovation of smart devices and internet-of-things (IoT), smart homes have become prevalent. People tend to transform residences into smart homes by customizing off-the-shelf smart home platforms, instead of creating IoT systems from scratch. Among the alternatives, Home Assistant (HA) is one of the most popular platforms. It allows end-users (i.e., home residents) to smartify homes by (S1) integrating selected devices into the system, and (S2) creating YAML files to control those devices. Unfortunately, due to the diversity of devices and complexity of automatic configurations, many users have difficulty correctly creating YAML files. Consequently, their smart homes may not work as expected, causing frustration and concern in users.
  This paper presents a novel study on issues of YAML-based automation configuration in smart homes (issues related to S2). We mined the online forum Home Assistant Community for discussion threads related to automation configuration. By manually inspecting 190 threads, we revealed 3 categories of concerns: implementation, optimization, and debugging. Under each category, we classified discussions based on the issue locations and technical concepts involved. Among debugging discussions, we further classified discussions based on users' resolution strategies; we also applied existing analysis tools to buggy YAML files, to assess the tool effectiveness. Our study reveals the common challenges faced by users and frequently applied resolution strategies. There are 129 (68%) examined issues concerning debugging, but existing tools can detect at most 14 issues and fix none. It implies that existing tools provide limited assistance in automation configuration. Our research sheds light on future directions in smart home development.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Pixel Control: Challenges and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in sensors have led to high resolution and high data throughput at the pixel level. Simultaneously, the adoption of increasingly large (deep) neural networks (NNs) has lead to significant progress in computer vision. Currently, visual intelligence comes at increasingly high computational complexity, energy, and latency. We study a data-driven system that combines dynamic sensing at the pixel level with computer vision analytics at the video level and propose a feedback control loop to minimize data movement between the sensor front-end and computational back-end without compromising detection and tracking precision. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce anticipatory attention and show that it leads to high precision prediction with sparse activation of pixels; (2) Leveraging the feedback control, we show that the dimensionality of learned feature vectors can be significantly reduced with increased sparsity; and (3) We emulate analog design choices (such as varying RGB or Bayer pixel format and analog noise) and study their impact on the key metrics of the data-driven system. Comparative analysis with traditional pixel and deep learning models shows significant performance enhancements. Our system achieves a 10X reduction in bandwidth and a 15-30X improvement in Energy-Delay Product (EDP) when activating only 30% of pixels, with a minor reduction in object detection and tracking precision. Based on analog emulation, our system can achieve a throughput of 205 megapixels/sec (MP/s) with a power consumption of only 110 mW per MP, i.e., a theoretical improvement of ~30X in EDP.</description>

      <title>Hybrid lunar ISRU plant: a comparative analysis with carbothermal reduction and water extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To establish a self-sustained human presence in space and to explore deeper into the solar system, extensive research has been conducted on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems. Past studies have proposed and researched many technologies to produce oxygen from regolith, such as carbothermal reduction and water extraction from icy regolith, to utilize it for astronauts' life support and as the propellant of space systems. However, determining the most promising technology remains challenging due to uncertainties in the lunar environment and processing methods. To better understand the lunar environment and ISRU operations, it is crucial to gather more information. Motivated by this need for information gathering, this paper proposes a new ISRU plant architecture integrating carbothermal reduction of dry regolith and water extraction from icy regolith. Two different hybrid plant architectures integrating both technologies (1) in parallel and (2) in series are examined. The former involves mining and processing in both a Permanently Shadowed Region (PSR) and a peak of eternal light in parallel, while the latter solely mines in a PSR. In this series hybrid architecture, the dry regolith tailings from water extraction are further processed by carbothermal reduction. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of the landed mass and required power of each plant architecture utilizing subsystem-level models. Furthermore, based on uncertain parameters such as resource content in regolith, the potential performance range of each plant was discovered through Monte Carlo simulations. The result indicates the benefit of the series hybrid architecture in terms of regolith excavation rate, while its mass cost seems the highest among the studied architectures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Capability-Based Control Distributions of Human-Robot Teams Through Capability Deltas: Formalization and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implicit assumption that human and autonomous agents have certain capabilities is omnipresent in modern teaming concepts. However, none formalize these capabilities in a flexible and quantifiable way. In this paper, we propose Capability Deltas, which establish a quantifiable source to craft autonomous assistance systems in which one agent takes the leader and the other the supporter role. We deduct the quantification of human capabilities based on an established assessment and documentation procedure from occupational inclusion of people with disabilities. This allows us to quantify the delta, or gap, between a team's current capability and a requirement established by a work process. The concept is then extended to the multi-dimensional capability space, which then allows to formalize compensation behavior and assess required actions by the autonomous agent.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Over-The-Air Consensus for Collision Avoidance and Formation Control in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a distributed control method for multi-agent robotic systems employing Over the Air Consensus (OtA-Consensus). Designed for agents with decoupled single-integrator dynamics, this approach aims at efficient formation achievement and collision avoidance. As a distinctive feature, it leverages OtA's ability to exploit interference in wireless channels, a property traditionally considered a drawback, thus enhancing communication efficiency among robots. An analytical proof of asymptotic convergence is established for systems with time-varying communication topologies represented by sequences of strongly connected directed graphs. Comparative evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency improvements over current state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with a large number of agents.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Vector-form $LDL^\top$ Decomposition for Accelerating Execution-time-certified $\ell_1$-penalty Soft-constrained MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handling possible infeasibility and providing an execution time certificate are two pressing requirements of real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC). To meet these two requirements simultaneously, this paper proposes an $\ell_1$-penalty soft-constrained MPC formulation that is globally feasible and solvable with an execution time certificate using our proposed algorithm. This paper proves for the first time that $\ell_1$-penalty soft-constrained MPC problems can be equivalently transformed into a box-constrained quadratic programming (Box-QP) and then our previous execution-time-certified algorithm \cite{wu2023direct} (only limited to Box-QP) can be applied. However, our previous Box-QP algorithm \cite{wu2023direct}, which provides a theoretical execution-time certificate, is conservative in its iteration analysis, thus sacrificing computation efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a novel $LDL^\top$ decomposition for the first time, to accelerate the computation of Newton step at each iteration. The speedup of our $LDL^\top$ decomposition comes from two-fold: \textit{i)} exploitation of the fact that the number of inequality constraints is generally larger than the number of variables in condensed MPC formulations, \textit{ii)} vectorized and parallel implementation based on based on its vector-wise operations, instead of element-wise operations of previous decomposition methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate great speedups of the proposed $LDL^\top$ decomposition (even up to 1000-fold, compared to the standard Choleksky method), which thus helps our solver achieve comparable computation performance to the state-of-the-art solvers such as IPOPT and OSQP. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/liangwu2019/L1-penalty-QP}.</description>

Abstract: Advanced control, operation, and planning tools of electrical networks with ML are not straightforward. 110 experts were surveyed to show where and how ML algorithms could advance. This paper assesses this survey and research environment. Then, it develops an innovation roadmap that helps align our research community with a goal-oriented realisation of the opportunities that AI upholds. This paper finds that the R&amp;D environment of system operators (and the surrounding research ecosystem) needs adaptation to enable faster developments with AI while maintaining high testing quality and safety. This roadmap serves system operators, academics, and labs advancing next-generation electrical network tools.</description>

      <title>On Building Myopic MPC Policies using Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of supervised learning techniques in combination with model predictive control (MPC) has recently generated significant interest, particularly in the area of approximate explicit MPC, where function approximators like deep neural networks are used to learn the MPC policy via optimal state-action pairs generated offline. While the aim of approximate explicit MPC is to closely replicate the MPC policy, substituting online optimization with a trained neural network, the performance guarantees that come with solving the online optimization problem are typically lost. This paper considers an alternative strategy, where supervised learning is used to learn the optimal value function offline instead of learning the optimal policy. This can then be used as the cost-to-go function in a myopic MPC with a very short prediction horizon, such that the online computation burden reduces significantly without affecting the controller performance. This approach differs from existing work on value function approximations in the sense that it learns the cost-to-go function by using offline-collected state-value pairs, rather than closed-loop performance data. The cost of generating the state-value pairs used for training is addressed using a sensitivity-based data augmentation scheme.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic control of nonlinear systems with Koopman operator learning and the Nystr\"om method</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study how the Koopman operator framework can be combined with kernel methods to effectively control nonlinear dynamical systems. While kernel methods have typically large computational requirements, we show how random subspaces (Nystr\"om approximation) can be used to achieve huge computational savings while preserving accuracy. Our main technical contribution is deriving theoretical guarantees on the effect of the Nystr\"om approximation. More precisely, we study the linear quadratic regulator problem, showing that the approximated Riccati operator converges at the rate $m^{-1/2}$, and the regulator objective, for the associated solution of the optimal control problem, converges at the rate $m^{-1}$, where $m$ is the random subspace size. Theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments corroborating our results.</description>

      <title>Online Model-based Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series: Taxonomy, Survey, Research Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in engineering processes, like development, manufacturing and other operations involving dynamic systems. These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</description>
