      <title>Driven-Dissipative Landau Polaritons: Two Highly Nonlinearly-Coupled Quantum Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated MATLAB Software for Atom-Ion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a MATLAB script which can use GPU acceleration to simulate a trapped ion interacting with a low-density cloud of atoms. This script, called atomiongpu.m, can massively parallelize MD simulations of trajectories of a trapped ion and an atom starting far away. The script uses ode45gpu, which is our optimized and specialized implementation of the Runge-Kutta algorithm used in MATLAB's ODE solver ode45. We first discuss the physical system and show how ode45gpu can solve it up to 22x faster than MATLAB's ode45. Then, we show how to easily modify the inputs to atomiongpu.m to account for different kinds of atoms, ions, atom-ion interactions, trap potentials, simulation parameters, initial conditions, and computational hardware, so that atomiongpu.m automatically finds the probability of complex formation, the distribution of observables such as the scattering angle and complex lifetime, and plots of specific trajectories.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars through the lens of correlation matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS that either have known analytic expressions or are captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find that the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively identify QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables the manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, thereby distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of three-body resonances to bound states in a continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-body resonances are ubiquitous in few-body physics and are characterized by a finite lifetime before decaying into continuum states of their composing subsystems. In this work we present a theoretical study on the possibility to stabilize three-body resonances to so-called bound states in a continuum: resonances with vanishing width that do not decay. Within a simple two-channel approach we unveil the underlying mechanism and suggest that the lifetime can be varied by a continuous tuning of system parameters. The validity of our theory is illustrated in two rather different examples, a mass-imbalanced system in one dimension and a system of three identical bosons in three dimensions, relevant to Efimov physics. Crucially, for the latter we find that one of the tunable parameters to achieve a three-body bound state in a continuum is an external magnetic field, a common tunable variable in cold-atom experiments. Due to the fundamental nature of our theory, it is expected to hold in other few-body systems, possibly opening new avenues for basic studies of otherwise unstable systems, and elevating few-body systems to interesting candidates for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moir\'e lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moir\'e lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moir\'e effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moir\'e effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moir\'e parameter. Evidences of the one-dimensional moir\'e effect are explicitly explored, including cavity field spectrum, phase transition dynamics, and anomalous atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moir\'e effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moir\'e metrology.</description>
