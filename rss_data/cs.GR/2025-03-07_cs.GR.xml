      <title>Beyond Existance: Fulfill 3D Reconstructed Scenes with Pseudo Details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has significantly advanced 3D reconstruction by providing high fidelity and fast training speeds across various scenarios. While recent efforts have mainly focused on improving model structures to compress data volume or reduce artifacts during zoom-in and zoom-out operations, they often overlook an underlying issue: training sampling deficiency. In zoomed-in views, Gaussian primitives can appear unregulated and distorted due to their dilation limitations and the insufficient availability of scale-specific training samples. Consequently, incorporating pseudo-details that ensure the completeness and alignment of the scene becomes essential. In this paper, we introduce a new training method that integrates diffusion models and multi-scale training using pseudo-ground-truth data. This approach not only notably mitigates the dilation and zoomed-in artifacts but also enriches reconstructed scenes with precise details out of existing scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks and extends the capabilities of 3D reconstruction beyond training datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Object Placement Programs for Indoor Scene Synthesis with Iterative Self Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data driven and autoregressive indoor scene synthesis systems generate indoor scenes automatically by suggesting and then placing objects one at a time. Empirical observations show that current systems tend to produce incomplete next object location distributions. We introduce a system which addresses this problem. We design a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that specifies functional constraints. Programs from our language take as input a partial scene and object to place. Upon execution they predict possible object placements. We design a generative model which writes these programs automatically. Available 3D scene datasets do not contain programs to train on, so we build upon previous work in unsupervised program induction to introduce a new program bootstrapping algorithm. In order to quantify our empirical observations we introduce a new evaluation procedure which captures how well a system models per-object location distributions. We ask human annotators to label all the possible places an object can go in a scene and show that our system produces per-object location distributions more consistent with human annotators. Our system also generates indoor scenes of comparable quality to previous systems and while previous systems degrade in performance when training data is sparse, our system does not degrade to the same degree.</description>

      <title>DDCSR: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Cortical Surface Reconstruction from Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) plays a crucial role in studying brain white matter connectivity. Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR), including the inner whiter matter (WM) and outer pial surfaces, is one of the key tasks in dMRI analyses such as fiber tractography and multimodal MRI analysis. Existing CSR methods rely on anatomical T1-weighted data and map them into the dMRI space through inter-modality registration. However, due to the low resolution and image distortions of dMRI data, inter-modality registration faces significant challenges. This work proposes a novel end-to-end learning framework, DDCSR, which for the first time enables CSR directly from dMRI data. DDCSR consists of two major components, including: (1) an implicit learning module to predict a voxel-wise intermediate surface representation, and (2) an explicit learning module to predict the 3D mesh surfaces. Compared to several baseline and advanced CSR methods, we show that the proposed DDCSR can largely increase both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate a high generalization ability of DDCSR to data from different sources, despite the differences in dMRI acquisitions and populations.</description>

      <title>Drag Your Gaussian: Effective Drag-Based Editing with Score Distillation for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene editing have been propelled by the rapid development of generative models. Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

      <title>DEFT: Differentiable Branched Discrete Elastic Rods for Modeling Furcated DLOs in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.
