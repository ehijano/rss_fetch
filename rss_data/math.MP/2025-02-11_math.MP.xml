      <title>Cumulant Structures of Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to derive exact cumulant expressions of any order of von Neumann entropy over Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble. The new method uncovers hidden cumulant structures that decouple each cumulant in a summation-free manner into its lower-order joint cumulants involving families of ancillary statistics. Importantly, the new method is able to avoid the seemingly inevitable task of simplifying nested summations of increasing difficulty that prevents the existing method in the literature to obtain higher-order cumulants.</description>

      <title>On the diagonals of rational functions: the minimal number of variables (unabridged version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From some observations on the linear differential operators occurring in the Lattice Green function of the d-dimensional face centred and simple cubic lattices, and on the linear differential operators occurring in the n-particle contributions
  to the magnetic susceptibility of the square Ising model, we forward some conjectures on the diagonals of rational functions. These conjectures are also in agreement with exact results we obtain for many Calabi-Yau operators, and many other examples related, or not related to physics.
  Consider a globally bounded power series which is the diagonal of rational functions of a certain number of variables, annihilated by an irreducible minimal order linear differential operator homomorphic to its adjoint. Among the logarithmic formal series solutions, at the origin, of this operator, call n the highest power of the logarithm. We conjecture that this diagonal series can be represented as a diagonal of a rational function with a minimal number of variables N_v related to this highest power n by the relation N_v = n +2.
  Since the operator is homomorphic to its adjoint, its differential Galois group is symplectic or orthogonal. We also conjecture that the symplectic or orthogonal character of the differential Galois group is related to the parity of the highest power n, namely symplectic for n odd and orthogonal for n even.
  We also sketch the case where the denominator of the rational function is not irreducible and is the product of, for instance, two polynomials. The analysis of the linear differential operators annihilating the diagonal of rational function where the denominator is the product of two polynomials, sheds some light on the emergence of such mixture of direct sums and products of factors.
  The conjecture N_v = n +2 still holds for such reducible linear differential operators.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Eigenfunction-Based Neural Operator for Learning Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) is emerging in many scientific and engineering disciplines, driving advancements in areas such as fluid dynamics, materials science, and biological systems. In this work, we introduce the Laplacian Eigenfunction-Based Neural Operator (LE-NO), a framework for efficiently learning nonlinear terms in PDEs, with a particular focus on nonlinear parabolic equations. By leveraging data-driven approaches to model the right-hand-side nonlinear operator, the LE-NO framework uses Laplacian eigenfunctions as basis functions, enabling efficient approximation of the nonlinear term. This approach reduces the computational complexity of the problem by enabling direct computation of the inverse Laplacian matrix and helps overcome challenges related to limited data and large neural network architectures--common hurdles in operator learning. We demonstrate the capability of our approach to generalize across various boundary conditions and provide insights into its potential applications in mathematical physics. Our results highlight the promise of LE-NO in capturing complex nonlinear behaviors, offering a robust tool for the discovery and prediction of underlying dynamics in PDEs.</description>

      <title>Principal SUSY and nonSUSY W-algebras and their Zhu algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we prove when $\mathfrak{g}$ is a simple basic Lie superalgebra with a principal odd nilpotent element $f$ the W-algebra $W^k(\mathfrak{g}, F)$ for $F=-\frac{1}{2}[f,f]$ is isomorphic to the SUSY W-algebra $W^k(\bar{\mathfrak{g}},f)$, which implies the supersymmetry of $W^k(\mathfrak{g}, F)$. In the second part, we introduce a finite SUSY W-algebra, which is a Hamiltonian reduction of $U(\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}})$ for the Takiff superalgebra $\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}=\mathfrak{g}\otimes \wedge(\theta)$ and show that it is isomorphic to the Zhu algebra of a SUSY W-algebra. As a corollary, we show a finite SUSY principal W-algebra is isomorphic to a finite principal W-algebra.</description>

      <title>Polynomially Superintegrable Hamiltonians Separating in Cartesian Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding superintegrable Hamiltonians and their integrals of motion can be reduced to solving a series of compatibility equations that result from the overdetermination of the commutator or Poisson bracket relations. The computation of the compatibility equations requires a general formula for the coefficients, which in turn must depend on the potential to be solved for. This is in general a nonlinear problem and quite difficult. Thus, research has focused on dividing the classes of potential into standard and exotic ones so that a number of parameters may be set to zero and the coefficients may be obtained in a simpler setting. We have developed a new method in both the classical and quantum setting which readily yields a formula for the coefficients of the invariant without recourse to this division in the case of Cartesian-separable Hamiltonians. Even though they allow separation of variables as they in general involve potential in terms of higher transcendental and beyond hypergeometric for their wavefunctions, they are quite non-trivial models. The expressions we obtain are in general non-polynomial in the momenta whose fractional terms can be arbitrarily set to zero. These conditions are equivalent to the compatibility equations, but the only unknowns in addition to the potential are constant parameters. We also give the fourth-order standard potentials, and conjectures about general families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the scattering of BPS magnetic monopoles through numerical simulations. We present an ansatz for various multi-monopole configurations suitable for analyzing monopole scattering processes. Our study includes planar scattering scenarios involving two, three, and four monopoles, as well as non-planar processes where three and four monopoles form intermediate tetrahedral and cubic states, respectively. Our observations align with the theoretical predictions of the moduli space approximation. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to relativistic velocities and explore parameters beyond the BPS limit.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable multicomponent spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generalising the one to one correspondence between exactly solvable hermitian matrices $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^\dagger$ and exactly solvable spinless fermion systems $\mathcal{H}_f=\sum_{x,y}c_x^\dagger\mathcal{H}(x,y)c_y$, four types of exactly solvable multicomponent fermion systems are constructed explicitly. They are related to the multivariate Krawtcouk, Meixner and two types of Rahman like polynomials, constructed recently by myself. The Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are the eigenvectors of certain real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ which are related to the difference equations governing them. The corresponding fermions have nearest neighbour interactions. The Rahman like polynomials are eigenvectors of certain reversible Markov chain matrices $\mathcal{K}$, from which real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ are uniquely defined by the similarity transformation in terms of the square root of the stationary distribution. The fermions have wide range interactions.</description>

Abstract: A formula for the full nonperturbative topological string free energy was recently proposed by Hattab and Palti \cite{HP24a}. In this work, we extend their result to the refined topological string theory. We demonstrate that the proposed formula for the full nonperturbative refined topological string free energy correctly reproduces the trans-series structure of the refined topological string and captures the Stokes automorphisms associated with its resurgent properties.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of entangled states induced by noncommutative deformation of phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the notion of quantum entanglement induced by the deformation of phase-space through noncommutative space (NC) parameters. The geometric structure of the state space for Gaussian states in NC-space is illustrated through information geometry approach. We parametrize the phase-space distributions by their covariances and utilize the Fisher-Rao metric to construct the statistical manifold associated with quantum states. We describe the notion of the Robertson-Scr\"{o}dinger uncertainty principle (RSUP) and positive partial transpose (PPT) conditions for allowed quantum states and separable states, respectively, for NC-space. RSUP and PPT provide the restrictions on all allowed states and separable states, respectively. This enables us to estimate the relative volumes of set of separable states and entangled states. Numerical estimations are provided for a toy model of a bipartite Gaussian state. We restrict our study to such bipartite Gaussian states, for which the entanglement is induced by the noncommutative phase-space parameters.</description>

      <title>An estimate for $\beta$-Hermite ensembles via the zeros of Hermite polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an $N$-dimensional random vector which describes the ordered eigenvalues of a $\beta$-Hermite ensemble, and let $z$ the vector containing the ordered zeros of the Hermite poynomial $H_N$. We present an explicit estimate for $P(\|X-z\|_2\ge\epsilon)$ for small $\epsilon&gt;0$ and large parameters $\beta$. The proof is based on a central limit theorem for these ensembles for $\beta\to\infty$ with explicit eigenvalues of the covariance matrices of the limit. The estimate is similar to previous estimates of Dette and Imhof (2009).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of nonlocal multi-phase variable exponent problems within the framework of a newly introduced Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev space. We consider two problems, each distinguished by the type of nonlinearity it includes. To establish the existence of at least one nontrivial solution for each problem, we employ two different monotone operator methods.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for bound states subjected to general potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the analytic solution to the problem of bound states of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation in 1D and its properties, in the presence of external potentials in the form of finite square wells or attractive Dirac deltas, as well as stable solitons for repulsive defects. We show that the GP equation can be mapped to a first-order non-autonomous dynamical system, whose solutions can sometimes be written in terms of known functions. The formal solutions of this non-conservative system can be written with the help of Glauber-Trotter formulas or a series of ordered exponentials in the coordinate $x$. With this we illustrate how to solve any nonlinear problem based on a construction due to Mello and Kumar for the linear case (layered potentials). For the benefit of the reader, we comment on the difference between the integrability of a quantum system and the solvability of the wave equation.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize some results in our previous work on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

      <title>DGNO: A Novel Physics-aware Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems based on Deep, Generative Probabilistic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated PDE-based, inverse problems is a central task in engineering and physics, yet existing neural operator methods struggle with high-dimensional, discontinuous inputs and require large amounts of {\em labeled} training data. We propose the Deep Generative Neural Operator (DGNO), a physics-aware framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a deep, generative, probabilistic model in combination with a set of lower-dimensional, latent variables that simultaneously encode PDE-inputs and PDE-outputs. This formulation can make use of unlabeled data and significantly improves inverse problem-solving, particularly for discontinuous or discrete-valued input functions. DGNO enforces physics constraints without labeled data by incorporating as virtual observables, weak-form residuals based on compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs). These relax regularity constraints and eliminate higher-order derivatives from the objective function. We also introduce MultiONet, a novel neural operator architecture, which is a more expressive generalization of the popular DeepONet that significantly enhances the approximating power of the proposed model. These innovations make DGNO particularly effective for challenging forward and inverse, PDE-based problems, such as those involving multi-phase media. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DGNO achieves higher accuracy across multiple benchmarks while exhibiting robustness to noise and strong generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Its adaptability, and the ability to handle sparse, noisy data while providing probabilistic estimates, make DGNO a powerful tool for scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spreading Under Power Law Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic spreading of a dense suspension of particles under power law repulsive potentials decaying as $1/r^k$. We find analytically that the particles spread in a self-similar form, where the radius grows with time as $t^{1/(k+2)}$. Our results closely align with experiments of paramagnetic colloidal particles under an external magnetic field interacting via a $1/r^3$ potential. We further substantiate the theory by molecular dynamic simulations of thousands of particles in one and two dimensions. The simulations reveal a rich diversity of behaviors contingent on the value of $k$. Specifically, for $k&gt;D-2$ (where $D$ is the dimension), the density is centered in the middle, for $k = D-2$, density is uniform, and for $k&lt;D-2$, there is an aggregation of particles at the edge of the suspension. When two or more such suspensions are placed near each other, the system retains a power-law memory of its initial state, resulting in a particle-free zone at the interface of the merging populations.</description>

      <title>Exact collective occupancies of the Moshinsky model in two-dimensional geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground state of $N$ bosonic atoms confined in a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic trap, where the atoms interact via a harmonic potential. We derive an exact diagonal representation of the first-order reduced density matrix in polar coordinates, in which the angular components of the natural orbitals are eigenstates of the angular momentum operator. Furthermore, we present an exact expression for the collective occupancy of the natural orbitals with angular momentum $l$, quantifying the fraction of particles carrying that angular momentum. The present study explores how the dependence of collective occupancy relies on angular momentum $l$ and the control parameters of the system. Building on these findings, we examine boson fragmentation into components with different $l$ and reveal a unique feature of the system: the natural orbitals contributing to the correlations are uniformly distributed across all significant $l$ components.</description>

      <title>Spectral and dynamical results related to certain non-integer base expansions on the unit interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider certain non-integer base $\beta$-expansions of Parry's type and we study various properties of the transfer (Perron-Frobenius) operator $\mathcal{P}:L^p([0,1])\mapsto L^p([0,1])$ with $p\geq 1$ and its associated composition (Koopman) operator, which are induced by a discrete dynamical system on the unit interval related to these $\beta$-expansions. We show that if $f$ is Lipschitz, then the iterated sequence $\{\mathcal{P}^N f\}_{N\geq 1}$ converges exponentially fast (in the $L^1$ norm) to an invariant state corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$ of $\mathcal{P}$. This "attracting" eigenvalue is not isolated: for $1\leq p\leq 2$ we show that the point spectrum of $\mathcal{P}$ also contains the whole open complex unit disk and we explicitly construct some corresponding eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Convex Split Lemma without Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a refinement to the convex split lemma by replacing the max mutual information with the collision mutual information, transforming the inequality into an equality. This refinement yields tighter achievability bounds for quantum source coding tasks, including state merging and state splitting. Furthermore, we derive a universal upper bound on the smoothed max mutual information, where "universal" signifies that the bound depends exclusively on R\'enyi entropies and is independent of the system's dimensions. This result has significant implications for quantum information processing, particularly in applications such as the reverse quantum Shannon theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the momentum, the density, and the electromagnetic field associated with the massive KleinGordon-Maxwell equations converge in the semi-classical limit towards their respective equivalents associated with the relativistic Euler-Maxwell equations. The proof relies on a modulated stress-energy method and a compactness argument. We also give a proof of the well-posedness of the relativistic Euler-Maxwell equations and show how this system, and so the semi-classical limit of Klein-Gordon-Maxwell, is related to the relativistic massive Vlasov-Maxwell equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every twist of pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group GL(N) can be realized as an open-string field theory in topological string theory. Our approach reinterprets twists of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as generalized Chern-Simons theories, and identifies topological string backgrounds that produce the corresponding Chern-Simons theories.</description>

      <title>Survival probabilities in biased random walks: To restart or not to restart? that is the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent survival probability function $S(t;x_0,q)$ of biased Sisyphus random walkers, who at each time step have a finite probability $q$ to step towards an absorbing trap at the origin and a complementary probability $1-q$ to return to their initial position $x_0$, is derived {\it analytically}. In particular, we explicitly prove that the survival probability function of the walkers decays exponentially at asymptotically late times. Interestingly, our analysis reveals the fact that, for a given value $q$ of the biased jumping probability, the survival probability function $S(t;x_0,q)$ is characterized by a {\it critical} (marginal) value $x^{\text{crit}}_0(q)$ of the initial gap between the walkers and the trap, above which the late-time survival probability of the biased Sisyphus random walkers is {\it larger} than the corresponding survival probability of standard random walkers.</description>

      <title>Exact NESS of XXZ circuits boundary driven with arbitrary resets or fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose spatially inhomogeneous matrix product ansatz for an exact many-body density operator of a boundary driven XXZ quantum circuit. The ansatz has formally infinite bond-dimension and is fundamentally different from previous constructions. The circuit is driven by a pair of reset quantum channels applied on the boundary qubits, which polarize the qubits to arbitrary pure target states. Moreover, one of the reset channels can be replaced by an arbitrary local unitary gate, thus representing a hybrid case with coherent/incoherent driving. Analyzing the ansatz we obtain a family of relatively robust separable nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), which can be viewed as a circuit extension of spin-helix states, and are particularly suited for experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>The Toda-Weyl mass spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The masses of affine Toda theories are known to correspond to the entries of a Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the relevant Cartan matrix. The Lagrangian of the theory can be expressed in terms of a suitable eigenvector of a Coxeter element in the Weyl group. We generalize this set-up by formulating Lagrangians based on eigenvectors of arbitrary elements in the Weyl group. Under some technical conditions (that hold for many Weyl group elements), we calculate the classical mass spectrum. In particular, we indicate the relation to the relative geometry of special roots, generalizing the affine Toda mass spectrum description in terms of the Cartan matrix. Related questions of three point coupling and integrability are left to be addressed on a future occasion.</description>

      <title>A switching identity for cable-graph loop soups and Gaussian free fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a "switching identity" that can be stated for critical Brownian loop-soups or for the Gaussian free field on a cable graph: It says that at the level of cluster configurations and at the more general level of the occupation time fields, conditioning two points on the cable-graph to belong to the same cluster of Brownian loops (or equivalently to the same sign-cluster of the GFF) amounts to adding a random odd number of independent Brownian excursions between these points to an otherwise unconditioned configuration. This explicit simple description of the conditional law of the clusters when a connection occurs has various direct consequences, in particular about the large scale behaviour of these sign-clusters on infinite graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Wasserstein distance and the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem for Gibbs measures of lattice systems of interacting particles at thermal equilibrium. In a nutshell, Dobrushin's uniqueness theorem provides a practical way to derive sufficient conditions on the inverse temperature and/or model parameters assuring uniqueness of Gibbs measures by reducing the uniqueness problem to a suitable estimate of the Wasserstein distance between pairs of 1-point Gibbs measures with different boundary conditions. After proving a general result of completeness for the Wasserstein distance, we reformulate the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem in a convenient form for lattice systems of interacting particles described by Hamiltonians that are not necessarily translation-invariant with possibly infinite-range pair-potentials and with general complete metric spaces as single-spin spaces. Our reformulation includes existence, and covers both classical lattice systems and the Euclidean version of quantum lattice systems. Further, a generalization to the Dobrushin-Shlosman theorem for translation-invariant lattice systems is given. Subsequently, we give a series of applications of these uniqueness criteria to some high-temperature classical lattice systems including the Heisenberg, Potts and Ising models. An application to classical lattice systems for which the local Gibbs measures are convex perturbations of Gaussian measures is also given.</description>

Abstract: Kato's well known distributional inequality for the magnetic Laplacian holds equally in the more general setting of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED), where the wave function is vector-valued and the vector potential is quantized. We give two new applications of this result: First, we show that eigenstates satisfy a subsolution estimate. Second, for general states, with energy distribution strictly below the ionization threshold, we give a short proof of pointwise exponential decay in the electronic configuration.</description>

      <title>From Zero-Freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing via a Christoffel-Darboux Type Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unifying proof to derive the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property for the general 2-spin system from zero-free regions of its partition function. Our proof works for the multivariate partition function over all three complex parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. Our main technical contribution is to establish a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin system on trees so that we are able to handle zero-free regions of the three different parameters $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ in a unified way. We use Riemann mapping theorem to deal with zere-free regions of arbitrary shapes.
  Our result comprehensively turns all existing zero-free regions (to our best knowledge) of the partition function of the 2-spin system where pinned vertices are allowed into the SSM property. As a consequence, we obtain novel SSM properties for the 2-spin system beyond the direct argument for SSM based on tree recurrence. Moreover, we extend our result to handle the 2-spin system with non-uniform external fields. As an application, we obtain a new SSM property and two new forms of spatial mixing property, namely plus and minus spatial mixing for the non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model from the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem.</description>

For the three different couplings, the analysis of the constraint algebra shows that the set of constraints does not form a first class system.</description>

      <title>Integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Extensions of the Liouville and Sinh-Gordon Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a general framework to construct integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of classical, two-dimensional Toda and conformal affine Toda theories. The scheme is applied to define the extended Liouville and Sinh-Gordon models; they are based on $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color Lie algebras and their fields satisfy a parabosonic statististics. The mathematical tools here introduced are the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded covariant extensions of the Lax pair formalism and of the Polyakov's soldering procedure. The $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Sinh-Gordon model is derived from an affine $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color Lie algebra, mimicking a procedure originally introduced by Babelon-Bonora to derive the ordinary Sinh-Gordon model. The color Lie algebras under considerations are: the $6$-generator $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $sl_2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded affine ${\widehat{sl_2}}$ algebra with two central extensions, the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Virasoro algebra obtained from a Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analyses of the Type D ASEP: Stochastic Fusion and Crystal Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Type D asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a particle system involving two classes of particles that can be viewed from both a probabilistic and an algebraic perspective (arXiv:2011.13473). From a probabilistic perspective, we perform stochastic fusion on the Type D ASEP and analyze the outcome on generator matrices, limits of drift speed, stationary distributions, and Markov self-duality. From an algebraic perspective, we construct a fused Type D ASEP system from a Casimir element of $U_q(so_6)$, using crystal bases to analyze and manipulate various representations of $U_q(so_6)$. We conclude that both approaches produce different processes and therefore the previous method of arXiv:1908.02359, which analyzed the usual ASEP, does not generalize to all finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics and large genus asymptotics of the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study combinatorial and asymptotic properties of some interesting rational numbers called the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten (BGW) numbers, which can be represented as the intersection numbers of psi and Theta classes on the moduli space of stable algebraic curves. In particular, we discover and prove the uniform large genus leading asymptotics of certain normalized BGW numbers, and give a new proof of the polynomiality phenomenon for the large genus asymptotics. We also propose, with extensive numerical data, several new conjectures including monotonicity and integrality on the BGW numbers. Applications to the Painlev\'e II hierarchy and to the BGW-kappa numbers are given.</description>

      <title>Extensions of exact and K-mixing dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider extensions of non-singular maps which are exact, respectively K-mixing, or at least have a decomposition into positive-measure exact, respectively K-mixing, components. The fibers of the extension spaces have countable (finite or infinite) cardinality and the action on them is assumed surjective or bijective. We call these systems, respectively, fiber-surjective and fiber-bijective extensions. Technically, they are skew products, though the point of view we take here is not the one generally associated with skew products. Our main results are an Exact and a K-mixing Decomposition Theorem. The latter can be used to show that a large number of periodic Lorentz gases (the term denoting here general group extensions of Sinai billiards, including Lorentz tubes and slabs, in any dimension) are K-mixing.</description>

      <title>Dunkl symplectic algebra in generalized Calogero models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of the symplectic sp(2N) algebra deformed using Dunkl operators, which describe the dynamical symmetry of the generalized N-particle quantum Calogero model. It contains a symmetry subalgebra formed by the deformed unitary generators as well as the (nondeformed) sl(2,R) conformal subalgebra. An explicit relation among the deformed symplectic generators is derived. Based on the matching between the Casimir elements of the conformal spin and Dunkl angular momentum algebras, the independent wavefunctions of the both the standard and generalized Calogero models, expressed in terms of the deformed spherical harmonics, are classified according to infinite-dimensional lowest-state sl(2,R) multiplets. Meanwhile, any polynomial integral of motion of the (generalized) Calogero-Moser model generates a finite-dimensional highest-state conformal multiplet with descendants expressed via the Weyl-ordered product in quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the stationary measure for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a segment with open boundaries is given by a marginal of a two-line measure with a simple and explicit description. We use this representation to analyze asymptotic fluctuations of the height function near the triple point for a larger set of parameters than was previously studied. As a second application, we determine a single expression for the rate function in the large deviation principle for the height function in the fan and in the shock region. We then discuss how this expression relates to the expressions available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Lagrangian system with nonholonomic constraints, we construct extensions of the equations of motion to sets of second-order ordinary differential equations. In the case of a purely kinetic Lagrangian, we investigate the conditions under which the nonholonomic trajectories are geodesics of a Riemannian metric, while preserving the constrained Lagrangian. We interpret the algebraic and PDE conditions of this problem as infinitesimal versions of the relation between the nonholonomic exponential map and the Riemannian metric. We discuss the special case of a Chaplygin system with symmetries and we end the paper with a worked-out example.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed in a series of runs of geometrically progressing resolution. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime but not so large so that the small length scales of the flow are impossible to resolve, except for very small liquid-sheet thickness. The Weber number based on grid size is then small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement with a finite volume method and height-function computation of curvature, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveals a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze droplet statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$. This non-convergence arises from the numerical sheet breakup effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical fluctuations (such as the variance) of causal set quantities, with particular focus on the causal set action. To facilitate calculating such fluctuations, we develop tools to account for correlations between causal intervals with different cardinalities. We present a convenient decomposition of the fluctuations of the causal set action into contributions that depend on different kinds of correlations. This decomposition can be used in causal sets approximated by any spacetime manifold $\mathcal M$. Our work paves the way for investigating a number of interesting discreteness effects, such as certain aspects of the Everpresent $\Lambda$ cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Metastability in Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glasses, in which the couplings are in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law for $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We show a sharp description of metastability on exponential timescales, in a form that is believed to hold for Glauber/Langevin dynamics for many mean-field spin glass models, but only known rigorously for the Random Energy Models. Namely, we establish a decomposition of the state space into sub-exponentially many wells, and show that the projection of the Glauber dynamics onto which well it resides in, asymptotically behaves like a Markov chain on wells with certain explicit transition rates. In particular, mixing inside wells occurs on much shorter timescales than transit times between wells, and the law of the next well the Glauber dynamics will fall into depends only on which well it currently resides in, not its full configuration. We can deduce consequences like an exact expression for the two-time autocorrelation functions that appear in the activated aging literature.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians After Slight Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</description>

Abstract: In this short article, we will reconstruct the KP equation from Plucker relations and provide some generalizations on this topic. Additionally, in the final section, we define the discrete function $\tau$ in a similar manner, leading to the construction of an integer sequence that has not yet been listed in the OEIS. Furthermore, this approach allows us to construct many other sequences that are not listed in the OEIS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new two-dimensional string theory defined by coupling two copies of Liouville CFT with complex central charge $c=13\pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. This string theory defines a novel, consistent and controllable model of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We use the exact solution of the worldsheet theory to derive stringent constraints on the analytic structure of the string amplitudes as a function of the vertex operator momenta. Together with other worldsheet constraints, this allows us to completely pin down the string amplitudes without explicitly computing the moduli space integrals. We focus on the case of the sphere four-point amplitude and torus one-point amplitude as worked examples. This is the first in a series of papers on the complex Liouville string: three subsequent papers will elucidate the holographic duality with a two-matrix integral, discuss worldsheet boundaries and non-perturbative effects, and connect the theory to de Sitter quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Annulus crossing formulae for critical planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact formulae for three basic annulus crossing events for the critical planar Bernoulli percolation in the continuum limit. The first is for the probability that there is an open path connecting the two boundaries of an annulus of inner radius $r$ and outer radius $R$. The second is for the probability that there are both open and closed paths connecting the two annulus boundaries. These two results were predicted by Cardy based on non-rigorous Coulomb gas arguments. Our third result gives the probability that there are two disjoint open paths connecting the two boundaries. Its leading asymptotic as $r/R\to 0$ is captured by the so-called backbone exponent, a transcendental number recently determined by Nolin, Qian and two of the authors. This exponent is the unique real root to the equation $\frac{\sqrt{36 x +3}}{4} + \sin (\frac{2 \pi \sqrt{12 x +1}}{3} ) =0$, other than $-\frac{1}{12}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. Besides these three real roots, this equation has countably many complex roots. Our third result shows that these roots appear exactly as exponents of the subleading terms in the crossing formula. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Expanding the same crossing probability as $r/R\to 1$, we obtain a series with logarithmic corrections at every order, suggesting that the backbone exponent is related to a logarithmic boundary CFT. Our proofs are based on the coupling between SLE curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The key is to encode the annulus crossing probabilities by the random moduli of certain LQG surfaces with annular topology, whose law can be extracted from the dependence of the LQG annuli partition function on their boundary lengths.</description>

      <title>Modular Properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the modular properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) in two dimensional conformal field theories. These are obtained by inserting higher spin charges in the expressions for the partition function of the theory. We investigate the particular case where KdV charges are inserted in the GGE. We first determine an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE. This expression is an expansion in terms of the zero modes of all the quasi-primary fields in the theory, not just the KdV charges. While these charges are non-commuting they can be re-exponentiated to give an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE in terms of another GGE. As an explicit example we focus on the Lee-Yang model. We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz in the Lee-Yang model to first replicate the asymptotic results, and then find additional energies that need to be included in the transformed GGE in order to find the exact modular transformation.</description>

      <title>The complex Liouville string: the matrix integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a duality between the complex Liouville string and a two-matrix integral. The complex Liouville string is defined by coupling two Liouville theories with complex central charges $c = 13 \pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. The matrix integral is characterized by its spectral curve which allows us to compute the perturbative string amplitudes recursively via topological recursion. This duality constitutes a controllable instance of holographic duality. The leverage on the theory is provided by the rich analytic structure of the string amplitudes that we discussed in arXiv:2409.18759 and allows us to perform numerous tests on the duality.</description>

      <title>On a Rigidity Result in Positive Scalar Curvature Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere can be rigid under smooth deformations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Stabilizer entropies of random bipartite pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximating the derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking by the hyperbolic Scarf potential, the scattering of particles by a gravitational wave generated by flyby is described analytically by following the Nikiforov-Uvarov method applied to the Scarf potential. Pure displacement arises when the wave zone contains an integer number of half-waves. The results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>
