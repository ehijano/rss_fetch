      <title>Transcribing and Translating, Fast and Slow: Joint Speech Translation and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the joint speech translation and recognition (JSTAR) model that leverages the fast-slow cascaded encoder architecture for simultaneous end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST). The model is transducer-based and uses a multi-objective training strategy that optimizes both ASR and ST objectives simultaneously. This allows JSTAR to produce high-quality streaming ASR and ST results. We apply JSTAR in a bilingual conversational speech setting with smart-glasses, where the model is also trained to distinguish speech from different directions corresponding to the wearer and a conversational partner. Different model pre-training strategies are studied to further improve results, including training of a transducer-based streaming machine translation (MT) model for the first time and applying it for parameter initialization of JSTAR. We demonstrate superior performances of JSTAR compared to a strong cascaded ST model in both BLEU scores and latency.</description>

      <title>TouchASP: Elastic Automatic Speech Perception that Everyone Can Touch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models demand a vast number of parameters, copious amounts of data, and significant computational resources during the training process. However, such models can merely be deployed on high-compute cloud platforms and are only capable of performing speech recognition tasks. This leads to high costs and restricted capabilities. In this report, we initially propose the elastic mixture of the expert (eMoE) model. This model can be trained just once and then be elastically scaled in accordance with deployment requirements. Secondly, we devise an unsupervised data creation and validation procedure and gather millions of hours of audio data from diverse domains for training. Using these two techniques, our system achieves elastic deployment capabilities while reducing the Character Error Rate (CER) on the SpeechIO testsets from 4.98\% to 2.45\%. Thirdly, our model is not only competent in Mandarin speech recognition but also proficient in multilingual, multi-dialect, emotion, gender, and sound event perception. We refer to this as Automatic Speech Perception (ASP), and the perception results are presented in the experimental section.</description>

      <title>SLAM-Omni: Timbre-Controllable Voice Interaction System with Single-Stage Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the potential of end-to-end real-time spoken dialogue systems, showcasing their low latency and high quality. In this paper, we introduce SLAM-Omni, a timbre-controllable, end-to-end voice interaction system with single-stage training. SLAM-Omni achieves zero-shot timbre control by modeling spoken language with semantic tokens and decoupling speaker information to a vocoder. By predicting grouped speech semantic tokens at each step, our method significantly reduces the sequence length of audio tokens, accelerating both training and inference. Additionally, we propose historical text prompting to compress dialogue history, facilitating efficient multi-round interactions. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that SLAM-Omni outperforms prior models of similar scale, requiring only 15 hours of training on 4 GPUs with limited data. Notably, it is the first spoken dialogue system to achieve competitive performance with a single-stage training approach, eliminating the need for pre-training on TTS or ASR tasks. Further experiments validate its multilingual and multi-turn dialogue capabilities on larger datasets.</description>

      <title>Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models are Simple Streaming Text to Speech Synthesizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Interleaved Speech-Text Language Model (IST-LM) for streaming zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS). Unlike many previous approaches, IST-LM is directly trained on interleaved sequences of text and speech tokens with a fixed ratio, eliminating the need for additional efforts in duration prediction and grapheme-to-phoneme alignment. The ratio of text chunk size to speech chunk size is crucial for the performance of IST-LM. To explore this, we conducted a comprehensive series of statistical analyses on the training data and performed correlation analysis with the final performance, uncovering several key factors: 1) the distance between speech tokens and their corresponding text tokens, 2) the number of future text tokens accessible to each speech token, and 3) the frequency of speech tokens precedes their corresponding text tokens. Experimental results demonstrate how to achieve an optimal streaming TTS system without complicated engineering, which we show has a limited gap with the non-streaming system. IST-LM is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, paving the way for streaming TTS with minimal overhead while largely maintaining performance.</description>

      <title>SyncFlow: Toward Temporally Aligned Joint Audio-Video Generation from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video and audio are closely correlated modalities that humans naturally perceive together. While recent advancements have enabled the generation of audio or video from text, producing both modalities simultaneously still typically relies on either a cascaded process or multi-modal contrastive encoders. These approaches, however, often lead to suboptimal results due to inherent information losses during inference and conditioning. In this paper, we introduce SyncFlow, a system that is capable of simultaneously generating temporally synchronized audio and video from text. The core of SyncFlow is the proposed dual-diffusion-transformer (d-DiT) architecture, which enables joint video and audio modelling with proper information fusion. To efficiently manage the computational cost of joint audio and video modelling, SyncFlow utilizes a multi-stage training strategy that separates video and audio learning before joint fine-tuning. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that SyncFlow produces audio and video outputs that are more correlated than baseline methods with significantly enhanced audio quality and audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, we demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities of SyncFlow, including zero-shot video-to-audio generation and adaptation to novel video resolutions without further training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dementia is associated with various cognitive impairments and typically manifests only after significant progression, making intervention at this stage often ineffective. To address this issue, the Prediction and Recognition of Cognitive Decline through Spontaneous Speech (PROCESS) Signal Processing Grand Challenge invites participants to focus on early-stage dementia detection. We provide a new spontaneous speech corpus for this challenge. This corpus includes answers from three prompts designed by neurologists to better capture the cognition of speakers. Our baseline models achieved an F1-score of 55.0% on the classification task and an RMSE of 2.98 on the regression task.</description>

      <title>LAMA-UT: Language Agnostic Multilingual ASR through Orthography Unification and Language-Specific Transliteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.</description>

      <title>Taming Multimodal Joint Training for High-Quality Video-to-Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to synthesize high-quality and synchronized audio, given video and optional text conditions, using a novel multimodal joint training framework MMAudio. In contrast to single-modality training conditioned on (limited) video data only, MMAudio is jointly trained with larger-scale, readily available text-audio data to learn to generate semantically aligned high-quality audio samples. Additionally, we improve audio-visual synchrony with a conditional synchronization module that aligns video conditions with audio latents at the frame level. Trained with a flow matching objective, MMAudio achieves new video-to-audio state-of-the-art among public models in terms of audio quality, semantic alignment, and audio-visual synchronization, while having a low inference time (1.23s to generate an 8s clip) and just 157M parameters. MMAudio also achieves surprisingly competitive performance in text-to-audio generation, showing that joint training does not hinder single-modality performance.

      <title>Predicting Artificial Neural Network Representations to Learn Recognition Model for Music Identification from Brain Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the representations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can exhibit notable similarities to cortical representations when subjected to identical auditory sensory inputs. In these studies, the ability to predict cortical representations is probed by regressing from ANN representations to cortical representations. Building upon this concept, our approach reverses the direction of prediction: we utilize ANN representations as a supervisory signal to train recognition models using noisy brain recordings obtained through non-invasive measurements. Specifically, we focus on constructing a recognition model for music identification, where electroencephalography (EEG) brain recordings collected during music listening serve as input. By training an EEG recognition model to predict ANN representations-representations associated with music identification-we observed a substantial improvement in classification accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach to developing recognition models for brain recordings in response to external auditory stimuli. It holds promise for advancing brain-computer interfaces (BCI), neural decoding techniques, and our understanding of music cognition. Furthermore, it provides new insights into the relationship between auditory brain activity and ANN representations.</description>

      <title>Music Genre Classification: Ensemble Learning with Subcomponents-level Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music Genre Classification is one of the most popular topics in the fields of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and digital signal processing. Deep Learning has emerged as the top performer for classifying music genres among various methods. The letter introduces a novel approach by combining ensemble learning with attention to sub-components, aiming to enhance the accuracy of identifying music genres. The core innovation of our work is the proposal to classify the subcomponents of the music pieces separately, allowing our model to capture distinct characteristics from those sub components. By applying ensemble learning techniques to these individual classifications, we make the final classification decision on the genre of the music. The proposed method has superior advantages in terms of accuracy compared to the other state-of-the-art techniques trained and tested on the GTZAN dataset.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Whisper on Low-Resource Languages for Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model for low-resource languages by introducing a novel data generation method that converts sentence-level data into a long-form corpus, using Swiss German as a case study. Non-sentence-level data, which could improve the performance of long-form audio, is difficult to obtain and often restricted by copyright laws. Our method bridges this gap by transforming more accessible sentence-level data into a format that preserves the model's ability to handle long-form audio and perform segmentation without requiring non-sentence-level data. Our data generation process improves performance in several real-world applications and leads to the development of a new state-of-the-art speech-to-text (STT) model for Swiss German. We compare our model with a non-fine-tuned Whisper and our previous state-of-the-art Swiss German STT models, where our new model achieves higher BLEU scores. Our results also indicate that the proposed method is adaptable to other low-resource languages, supported by written guidance and code that allows the creation of fine-tuned Whisper models, which keep segmentation capabilities and allow the transcription of longer audio files using only sentence-level data with high quality.</description>

      <title>RiTTA: Modeling Event Relations in Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation models achieving high-fidelity audio with fine-grained context understanding, they struggle to model the relations between audio events described in the input text. However, previous TTA methods have not systematically explored audio event relation modeling, nor have they proposed frameworks to enhance this capability. In this work, we systematically study audio event relation modeling in TTA generation models. We first establish a benchmark for this task by: 1. proposing a comprehensive relation corpus covering all potential relations in real-world scenarios; 2. introducing a new audio event corpus encompassing commonly heard audios; and 3. proposing new evaluation metrics to assess audio event relation modeling from various perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning framework to enhance existing TTA models ability to model audio events relation. Code is available at: https://github.com/yuhanghe01/RiTTA</description>

      <title>Data-Centric Improvements for Enhancing Multi-Modal Understanding in Spoken Conversation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational assistants are increasingly popular across diverse real-world applications, highlighting the need for advanced multimodal speech modeling. Speech, as a natural mode of communication, encodes rich user-specific characteristics such as speaking rate and pitch, making it critical for effective interaction. Our work introduces a data-centric customization approach for efficiently enhancing multimodal understanding in conversational speech modeling. Central to our contributions is a novel multi-task learning paradigm that involves designing auxiliary tasks to utilize a small amount of speech data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Spoken-SQuAD benchmark, using only 10% of the training data with open-weight models, establishing a robust and efficient framework for audio-centric conversational modeling. We also introduce ASK-QA, the first dataset for multi-turn spoken dialogue with ambiguous user requests and dynamic evaluation inputs. Code and data forthcoming.</description>

      <title>Detecting Throat Cancer from Speech Signals using Machine Learning: A Scoping Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Cases of throat cancer are rising worldwide. With survival decreasing significantly at later stages, early detection is vital. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to detect throat cancer from patient speech, facilitating earlier diagnosis and reducing the burden on overstretched healthcare systems. However, no comprehensive review has explored the use of AI and ML for detecting throat cancer from speech. This review aims to fill this gap by evaluating how these technologies perform and identifying issues that need to be addressed in future research. Materials and Methods: We conducted a scoping literature review across three databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. We included articles that classified speech using machine learning and specified the inclusion of throat cancer patients in their data. Articles were categorized based on whether they performed binary or multi-class classification. Results: We found 27 articles fitting our inclusion criteria, 12 performing binary classification, 13 performing multi-class classification, and two that do both binary and multiclass classification. The most common classification method used was neural networks, and the most frequently extracted feature was mel-spectrograms. We also documented pre-processing methods and classifier performance. We compared each article against the TRIPOD-AI checklist, which showed a significant lack of open science, with only one article sharing code and only three using open-access data. Conclusion: Open-source code is essential for external validation and further development in this field. Our review indicates that no single method or specific feature consistently outperforms others in detecting throat cancer from speech. Future research should focus on standardizing methodologies and improving the reproducibility of results.</description>

      <title>FLUX that Plays Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a simple extension of diffusion-based rectified flow Transformers for text-to-music generation, termed as FluxMusic. Generally, along with design in advanced Flux\footnote{https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux} model, we transfers it into a latent VAE space of mel-spectrum. It involves first applying a sequence of independent attention to the double text-music stream, followed by a stacked single music stream for denoised patch prediction. We employ multiple pre-trained text encoders to sufficiently capture caption semantic information as well as inference flexibility. In between, coarse textual information, in conjunction with time step embeddings, is utilized in a modulation mechanism, while fine-grained textual details are concatenated with the music patch sequence as inputs. Through an in-depth study, we demonstrate that rectified flow training with an optimized architecture significantly outperforms established diffusion methods for the text-to-music task, as evidenced by various automatic metrics and human preference evaluations. Our experimental data, code, and model weights are made publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/feizc/FluxMusic}.</description>

      <title>Pitch-and-Spectrum-Aware Singing Quality Assessment with Bias Correction and Model Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We participated in track 2 of the VoiceMOS Challenge 2024, which aimed to predict the mean opinion score (MOS) of singing samples. Our submission secured the first place among all participating teams, excluding the official baseline. In this paper, we further improve our submission and propose a novel Pitch-and-Spectrum-aware Singing Quality Assessment (PS-SQA) method. The PS-SQA is designed based on the self-supervised-learning (SSL) MOS predictor, incorporating singing pitch and spectral information, which are extracted using pitch histogram and non-quantized neural codec, respectively. Additionally, the PS-SQA introduces a bias correction strategy to address prediction biases caused by low-resource training samples, and employs model fusion technology to further enhance prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that our proposed PS-SQA significantly outperforms all competing systems across all system-level metrics, confirming its strong sing quality assessment capabilities.</description>

      <title>MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder: Towards a Speech Foundation Model for Singapore and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical report describes the MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder, a foundation model designed to support a wide range of downstream speech applications. Developed as part of Singapore's National Multimodal Large Language Model Programme, the MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder is tailored to address the speech processing needs in Singapore and the surrounding Southeast Asian region. The model currently supports mainly English, including the variety spoken in Singapore. We are actively expanding our datasets to gradually cover other languages in subsequent releases. The MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder was pre-trained from scratch on 200,000 hours of unlabelled speech data using a self-supervised learning approach based on masked language modelling. We describe our training procedure and hyperparameter tuning experiments in detail below. Our evaluation demonstrates improvements to spontaneous and Singapore speech benchmarks for speech recognition, while remaining competitive to other state-of-the-art speech encoders across ten other speech tasks. We commit to releasing our model, supporting broader research endeavours, both in Singapore and beyond.</description>
