      <title>Magnetic Reconnection on a Klein Bottle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new boundary condition for simulations of magnetic reconnection based on the topology of a Klein bottle. When applicable, the new condition is computationally cheaper than fully periodic boundary conditions, reconnects more flux than systems with conducting boundaries, and does not require assumptions about regions external to the simulation as is necessary for open boundaries. The new condition reproduces the expected features of reconnection, but cannot be straightforwardly applied in systems with asymmetric upstream plasmas.</description>

      <title>The Role of Helical and Non-Helical Drives on the evolution of Self-Consistent Dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the self-consistent dynamo limit, the magnetic feedback on the velocity field is sufficiently strong to induce a change in the topology of the magnetic field. Consequently, the magnetic energy reaches a state of non-linear saturation. Here, we investigate the role played by helical and non-helical drives in the triggering and the eventual saturation of a self-consistent dynamo. Evidence of small-scale dynamo (SSD) activity is found for both helical and non-helical forcing, driven at the largest possible scale. Based on the spectrum analysis, we find that the evolution of kinetic energy follows Kolmogorov's $k^-{\frac{5}{3}}$ law while that of magnetic energy follows Kazantsev's $k^{\frac{3}{2}}$ scaling. Also, we have verified that the aforementioned scalings remain valid for various magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm). Statistical analysis is found to support our numerical finds.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>

      <title>A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are prevalent on almost all astronomical scales, but their importance in different systems and over cosmic time is yet to be understood. Our current knowledge on the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most of our model predictions. In this study, we conduct rest-frame 131 $\mu$m full-polarisation ALMA observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of 0.9$\pm$0.2 per cent with a variation of $\pm$0.4 per cent across the regions with polarisation detection, similar to that of local starburst galaxies. The polarised dust emission is patchy. It mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s, and extends over 3 kiloparsecs with a bimodal distribution in position angles. Our analysis indicates that the kpc-scale polarised dust is most likely aligned by the large-scale magnetic fields associated with a galaxy merger. If the ordered fields are confirmed to be coherent, such early detection of large-scale magnetic fields favours an efficient formation of magnetic fields in primordial galaxies, which highlights the importance of magnetic fields in mediating galaxy evolution over long cosmic timescales. Future surveys towards a wider galaxy population are necessary to test the ubiquitousness of large-scale magnetic fields in early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Identification of new gold lines in the 350 to 1000 nm spectral region using laser produced plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a pilot study, using a laser-produced plasma, to identify new lines in the 350 to 1000 nm spectral region for the r-process element gold (Au), of relevance to studies of neutron star mergers. This was achieved via optical-IR spectroscopy of a laser-produced Au plasma, with an Au target of high purity (99.95 %) and a low vacuum pressure to remove any air contamination from the experimental spectra. Our data were recorded with a spectrometer of 750 mm focal length and 1200 lines mm-1 grating, yielding a resolution of 0.04 nm. We find 54 lines not previously identified and which are not due to the impurities (principally copper (Cu) and silver (Ag)) in our Au sample. Of these 54 lines, we provisionally match 21 strong transitions to theoretical results from collisional-radiative models that include energy levels derived from atomic structure calculations up to the 6s level. Some of the remaining 33 unidentified lines in our spectra are also strong and may be due to transitions involving energy levels which are higher-lying than those in our plasma models. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate that laser-produced plasmas are well suited to the identification of transitions in r-process elements, with the method applicable to spectra ranging from UV to IR wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Shock Hugoniot calculations using on-the-fly machine learned force fields with ab initio accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for computing the shock Hugoniot using on-the-fly machine learned force field (MLFF) molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, we employ an MLFF model based on the kernel method and Bayesian linear regression to compute the electronic free energy, atomic forces, and pressure; in conjunction with a linear regression model between the electronic internal and free energies to compute the internal energy, with all training data generated from Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). We verify the accuracy of the formalism by comparing the Hugoniot for carbon with recent Kohn-Sham DFT results in the literature. In so doing, we demonstrate that Kohn-Sham calculations for the Hugoniot can be accelerated by up to two orders of magnitude, while retaining ab initio accuracy. We apply this framework to calculate the Hugoniots of 14 materials in the FPEOS database, comprising 9 single elements and 5 compounds, between temperatures of 10 kK and 2 MK. We find good agreement with first principles results in the literature while providing tighter error bars. In addition, we confirm that the inter-element interaction in compounds decreases with temperature.</description>

      <title>Application of a plasma-based energy booster in operational free-electron lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma-based accelerators are a promising approach for reducing the size and cost of future particle accelerators, making them a viable technology for constructing and upgrading X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs). Adding an energy booster stage to the linear accelerator of an operational X-ray FEL is recognised as a realistic near-term application of plasma accelerators, with a significant impact on the scientific reach of these facilities. Here, we discuss potential use cases of such a plasma-based energy booster and apply particle-in-cell simulations to estimate its ability to enhance the performance of existing X-ray FEL facilities.</description>

      <title>Lightning as a natural accelerator of relativistic particles and a source of synchrotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A physical model of the formation of a vortex current in a plasma channel of lightning discharges due to the anomalous Hall effect caused by relativistic spin-orbit interaction phenomenon is proposed. The existence of fast electromagnetic surface plasmon waves propagating along the lightning discharge channel at a speed close to the speed of light in vacuum is shown. The spin properties of electrons become important at relativistic velocities, so the spin-orbit coupling arises as an effective magnetic force acting on the spin of an electron, leading to the formation of a spin-induced vortex current in the absence of an external magnetic field. This makes it possible to consider the lightning discharge channel as a charged particle accelerator that generates microwave, X-ray, gamma-ray and RF emissions by a current pulse moving along a helical trajectory via synchrotron and cyclotron radiation mechanisms. The proposed theoretical model of the formation of a spin-induced vortex current in the lightning plasma channel is consistent with observations of lightning and spark discharges.</description>

      <title>Calculating radio emissions of positive streamer phenomena using 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study radio emissions from positive streamers in air using 3D simulations, from which the radiated electric field is computed by solving Jefimenko's equations. The simulations are performed at 0.5 bar using two photoionization methods: the Helmholtz approximation for a photon density and a Monte Carlo method using discrete photons, with the latter being the most realistic. We consider cases with single streamers, streamer branching, streamers interacting with preionization and streamer-streamer encounters. We do not observe a strong VHF radio signal during or after branching, which is confirmed by lab experiments. This indicates that the current inside a streamer discharges evolves approximately continuously during branching. On the other hand, stochastic fluctuations in streamer propagation due to Monte Carlo photoionization lead to more radio emission being emitted at frequencies of 100 MHz and above. Another process that leads to such high-frequency emission is the interaction of a streamer with a weakly preionized region, for example present due to a previous discharge. In agreement with previous work, we observe the strongest and highest-frequency emission from streamer encounters. The amount of total energy that is radiated seems to depend primarily on the background electric field, and less on the particular streamer evolution. Finally, we present approximations for the maximal current along a streamer channel and a fit formula for a streamer's current moment.</description>

      <title>Expulsion of runaway electrons using ECRH in the TCV tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runaway electrons (REs) are a concern for tokamak fusion reactors from discharge startup to termination. A sudden localized loss of a multi-megaampere RE beam can inflict severe damage to the first wall. Should a disruption occur, the existence of a RE seed may play a significant role in the formation of a RE beam and the magnitude of its current. The application of central electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) in the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) reduces an existing RE seed population by up to three orders of magnitude within only a few hundred milliseconds. Applying ECRH before a disruption can also prevent the formation of a post-disruption RE beam in TCV where it would otherwise be expected. The RE expulsion rate and consequent RE current reduction are found to increase with applied ECRH power. Whereas central ECRH is effective in expelling REs, off-axis ECRH has a comparatively limited effect. A simple 0-D model for the evolution of the RE population is presented that explains the effective ECRH-induced RE expulsion results from the combined effects of increased electron temperature and enhanced RE transport.</description>

      <title>Microscopic characteristics of SF6 partial discharge induced by a floating linear metal particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct current (DC) gas insulated transmission lines (GILs) have been widely used in power transmission, but might be threatened by partial discharge due to the presence of floating impurities (e.g., dust and metal particles) inside the sealed chamber. In this letter, by using a 2D fluid model we characterize the microscopic properties of the partial discharge induced by a floating linear metal particle in SF6 (both the discharge propagation and interaction between space charge and metal particle) under negative high voltage direct current (HVDC) conditions. Due to the strong electronegativity of SF6, the spatiotemporal distributions of the charged species (electrons, positive and negative ions), space charge, and reduced electric field are rather different from those in air. Notably, a negative ion region is observed around the top tip of the metal particle, and it plays an important role in the generation and propagation of primary and secondary streamers in SF6, which may lead to severe motion characteristics of the particle and aliasing of partial discharge signals. Additionally, we analyze the charging process and electric force reversal phenomenon, which may provide a more precise understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the firefly motion previously reported for DC GILs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Regularization of Parker Sonic Critical Point in Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first ever systematic theoretical formulation addressing the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This development recognizes the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. This task is accomplished by constructing a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework for this purpose. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>
