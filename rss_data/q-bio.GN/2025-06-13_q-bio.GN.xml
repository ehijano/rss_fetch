      <title>Predicting function of evolutionarily implausible DNA sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel, functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12 state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant. Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.</description>

      <title>S3 Mirror: S3Mirror: Making Genomic Data Transfers Fast, Reliable, and Observable with DBOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To meet the needs of a large pharmaceutical organization, we set out to create S3Mirror - an application for transferring large genomic sequencing datasets between S3 buckets quickly, reliably, and observably. We used the DBOSTransact durable execution framework to achieve these goals and benchmarked the performance and cost of the application. S3Mirror is an open source DBOS Python application that can run in a variety of environments, including DBOS Cloud Pro where it runs as much as 40x faster than AWS DataSync at a fraction of the cost. Moreover, S3Mirror is resilient to failures and allows for real-time filewise observability of ongoing and past transfers.</description>

      <title>MARS: Processing-In-Memory Acceleration of Raw Signal Genome Analysis Inside the Storage Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals. However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement. Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by 427x and 72x.</description>

      <title>Selecting ChIP-seq Normalization Methods from the Perspective of their Technical Conditions</title>

Abstract: Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides insights into both the genomic location occupied by the protein of interest and the difference in DNA occupancy between experimental states. Given that ChIP-seq data is collected experimentally, an important step for determining regions with differential DNA occupancy between states is between-sample normalization. While between-sample normalization is crucial for downstream differential binding analysis, the technical conditions underlying between-sample normalization methods have yet to be examined for ChIP-seq. We identify three important technical conditions underlying ChIP-seq between-sample normalization methods: balanced differential DNA occupancy, equal total DNA occupancy, and equal background binding across states. To illustrate satisfying the selected normalization method's technical conditions for downstream differential binding analysis, we simulate ChIP-seq read count data where different combinations of the technical conditions are violated. We then externally verify our simulation results using experimental data. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers use their understanding of the ChIP-seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of between-sample normalization method. Alternatively, researchers can use a high-confidence peakset, which is the intersection of the differentially bound peaksets obtained from using different between-sample normalization methods. In our two experimental analyses, roughly half of the called peaks were called as differentially bound for every normalization method. High-confidence peaks are less sensitive to choice of between-sample normalization method and could be a more robust basis for identifying genomic regions with differential DNA occupancy between experimental states when there is uncertainty about which technical conditions are satisfied.</description>
