      <title>On forced swarmalators that move in higher-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective dynamics of swarmalators subjected to periodic (sinusoidal) forcing. Although previous research focused on the simplified case of motion in a one-dimensional (1D) periodic domain, we extend this analysis to the more realistic scenario of motion in two and three spatial dimensions with periodic boundary conditions. In doing so, we identify analogues of the 1D states and characterize their dynamics and stability boundaries analytically. Additionally, we investigate the forced swarmalators model with power-law interaction kernels, finding that the analytically tractable model with periodic boundary conditions can reproduce the observed dynamic behaviors of this more complex model.</description>

      <title>Why collective behaviours self-organise to criticality: A primer on information-theoretic and thermodynamic utility measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective behaviours are frequently observed to self-organise to criticality. Existing proposals to explain these phenomena, such as Self-organised Criticality (SOC), are fragmented across disciplines and only partially answer the question. This paper investigates the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches such as predictive information, empowerment, and active inference, as well as thermodynamic efficiency, which incorporates both information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities. By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that at the critical regime thermodynamic efficiency balances the predictability gained by the system and its energy costs. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.</description>
