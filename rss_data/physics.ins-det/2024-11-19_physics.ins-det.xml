      <title>A novel liquid argon purity monitor based on 207 Bi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel liquid argon purity monitor based on a 207 Bi radioactive source, emitting monochromatic internal-conversion electrons, is presented. This new monitor allows for a very precise and fast measurement of the electronegative impurities concentration in liquid argon. It can be operated continuously in liquid argon TPC experiments without interfering with the main detector operation. Different drift lengths can be assembled for the proposed device, to assess a large range of liquid argon purities while minimizing systematic uncertainties. Two prototypes have been built and successfully operated in dedicated test stands. The results and performance are reported.</description>

      <title>IRADCAL: A Monolithic Inorganic Scintillator And Thin Scintillators To Measure Low Energy Electron, Proton And Heavy Ion Albedo Spectrums From Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moon is directly exposed to various space radiation types: Solar Wind (ions between 0.5 to 10 keV and lower energy electrons), Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs, ranging from 10 keV to several hundred MeV ions and electrons), Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and Anomalous Cosmic Rays (ACRs, ranging from 1 to 100 MeV particles). Monitoring SEPs and GCRs is critical to assess the lunar radiation environment in preparation for the return of humans to the Moon and to understand related radiation risks. As part of the Turkish Lunar Mission (TLM), a small acceptance particle detector is being developed to measure the albedo electron, proton, and heavy ion fluxes backscattered from the lunar surface. In low lunar orbit, the detector FoV will look at the Moon surface. The IRADCAL detectors consist of several layers, from top to down: a Multi-Layer Insulator (MLI); a thin plastic scintillator (S1) seen by four Silicon Photomultipliers (SIPMs), placed to form a cross on light guide surrounding the scintillator (S1); a 26x26x70 mm3 CsI(Tl) crystal scintillator (S2) and a thin crystal scintillator seen by four SIPMs (S3). The detector is designed to measure contained proton energy spectrum from 400 keV to 150 MeV, electron from 50 keV to 10 MeV and heavy ions (up to the CNO group) with energies up to 20 MeV/n. IRADCAL will provide two dE/dX values from two thin scintillators, Etot or dE/dX from thick scintillator, and dE/E ratios for particle identification. A multi-layer perceptron is being developed by using deep neural network algorithm to estimate the Depth of Interaction (DoI). S1 provides level 1 trigger and hit position, which, combined with DoI point, will help determine if a particle is escaping from the sides and to separate up/down-going particles. The thicker S3 will help identify whether the event is fully contained. It will fit in 2U CubeSat with 2.5 kg and 15 Watts of power required.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hardware Synthesis Strategies for Machine Learning in Collider Trigger and Data Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully exploit the physics potential of current and future high energy particle colliders, machine learning (ML) can be implemented in detector electronics for intelligent data processing and acquisition. The implementation of ML in real-time at colliders requires very low latencies that are unachievable with a software-based approach, requiring optimization and synthesis of ML algorithms for deployment on hardware. An analysis of neural network inference efficiency is presented, focusing on the application of collider trigger algorithms in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Trade-offs are evaluated between two frameworks, the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) and hls4ml, in terms of resources and latency for different model sizes. Results highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering valuable insights for optimizing real-time neural network deployments at colliders. This work aims to guide researchers and engineers in selecting the most suitable hardware and software configurations for real-time, resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Novel Application of Neutrinos to Evaluate U.S. Nuclear Weapons Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing realization that neutrinos can be used as a diagnostic tool to better understand the inner workings of a nuclear weapon. Robust estimates demonstrate that an Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) neutrino scintillation detector built at the Nevada Test Site of 1000-ton active target mass at a standoff distance of 500 m would detect thousands of neutrino events per kTe of nuclear yield. This would provide less than 4% statistical error on measured neutrino rate and 5% error on neutrino energy. Extrapolating this to an error on the test device explosive yield requires knowledge from evaluated nuclear databases, non-equilibrium fission rates, and assumptions on internal neutron fluxes. Initial calculations demonstrate that prompt neutrino rates from a short pulse of Pu-239 fission is about a factor of two less than that from a steady state assumption. As well, there are significant energy spectral differences as a function of time after the pulse that needs to be considered. In the absence of nuclear weapons testing, many of the technical and theoretical challenges of a full nuclear test could be mitigated with a low cost smaller scale 20 ton fiducial mass IBD demonstration detector placed near a TRIGA pulsed reactor. The short duty cycle and repeatability of pulses would provide critical real environment testing and the measured neutrino rate as a function of time data would provide unique constraints on fission databases and equilibrium assumptions.</description>

      <title>Consensus Statement on Brillouin Light Scattering Microscopy of Biological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) spectroscopy is a non-invasive, non-contact, label-free optical technique that can provide information on the mechanical properties of a material on the sub-micron scale. Over the last decade it has seen increased applications in the life sciences, driven by the observed significance of mechanical properties in biological processes, the realization of more sensitive BLS spectrometers and its extension to an imaging modality. As with other spectroscopic techniques, BLS measurements not only detect signals characteristic of the investigated sample, but also of the experimental apparatus, and can be significantly affected by measurement conditions. The aim of this consensus statement is to improve the comparability of BLS studies by providing reporting recommendations for the measured parameters and detailing common artifacts. Given that most BLS studies of biological matter are still at proof-of-concept stages and use different--often self-built--spectrometers, a consensus statement is particularly timely to assure unified advancement.</description>

      <title>X-ray Microscopy and Talbot Imaging with the Matter in Extreme Conditions X-ray Imager at LCLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has shown the great potential that X-ray Free Electron Lasers (FEL) have to study High Energy Density (HED) matter. Experiments at FELs have made significant breakthroughs in Shock Physics and Dynamic Diffraction, Dense Plasma Physics and Warm Dense Matter Science, using techniques such as isochoric heating, inelastic scattering, small angle scattering and x-ray diffraction. In addition, and complementary to these techniques, the coherent properties of the FEL beam can be used to image HED samples with high fidelity. We present new imaging diagnostics and techniques developed at the Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) instrument at Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) over the last few years. We show results in Phase Contrast Imaging geometry, where the X-ray beam propagates from the target to a camera revealing its phase, as well as in Direct Imaging geometry, where a real image of the sample plane is produced in the camera with a spatial resolution down to 200 nm. Last, we show an implementation of the Talbot Imaging method allowing both x-ray phase and intensity measurements change introduced by a target with sub-micron resolution.</description>

      <title>Boltzman optical thermometry for cryogenics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and implement an optical technique to access the local temperature of an erbium doped crystal by probing the electron spin population under magnetic field. We reliably extract the sample temperature in the range 2-7 K. We additionally discuss the suitability of our method as a primary standard for cryogenic thermometry. By adding an auxiliary heating laser, we are able to measure the interface conductance between the dielectric crystal and the cold plate of the cryostat by exploring different cooling configurations.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Charge Multiplication in Thin $25 \mathrm{\mu m} \times 25 \mathrm{\mu m}$ Pitch 3D Silicon Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterization measurements of $25~\mathrm{\mu m} \times 25~\mathrm{\mu m}$ pitch 3D silicon sensors are performed, for devices with active thickness of $150~\mu$m. Evidence of charge multiplication caused by impact ionization below the breakdown voltage is observed in sensors operated at $-45~^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Small-pitch 3D silicon sensors have potential as high precision 4D tracking detectors that are also able to withstand radiation fluences beyond $10^{16}$~n$_{\rm eq}/$cm$^2$. This is applicable for use at future facilities such as the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider and the Future Circular Collider. Characteristics of these devices are compared to those of similar sensors of pitch $50~\mathrm{\mu m}\times 50~\mathrm{\mu m}$, showing comparable charge collection at low voltage, and acceptable leakage current, depletion voltage, breakdown voltage, and capacitance despite the extremely small cell size. The unirradiated $25~\mathrm{\mu m} \times 25~\mathrm{\mu m}$ sensors exhibit charge multiplication above about 90 V reverse bias, while, as predicted, no multiplication is observed in the $50~\mathrm{\mu m} \times 50~\mathrm{\mu m}$ sensors below their breakdown voltage. The maximum gain observed below breakdown is 1.33.</description>

      <title>The TOTEM nT2 detector: architecture, operation and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The TOTEM experiment at the LHC has produced a large set of measurements on diffractive processes and pp cross sections. A new detector, called nT2, has been designed to measure the inelastic scattering rate during the LHC special run of 2023. Due to the high radiation environment, the detector had to be installed in 10-20 minutes at most, then commissioned and operated after only few days. The detector, based on plastic scintillators read out by matrices of SiPMs, was designed with such constraints in mind. The front-end, DAQ and control electronics was developed with a fault tolerant architecture, moving as many functionalities as possible on a radiation tolerant SoC FPGA, hosting an integrated ARM controller. Here we will describe the nT2 detector and its read-out and control electronics. The detector was successfully operated during the special run: we will report the preliminary results on the detector performance.</description>
