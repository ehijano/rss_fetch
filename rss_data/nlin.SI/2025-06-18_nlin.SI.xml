      <title>Many-faced Painlev\'e I: irregular conformal blocks, topological recursion, and holomorphic anomaly approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the Fourier series (Zak transform) structure of the Painlev\'e I tau function has emerged in multiple contexts. Its main building block admits several conjectural interpretations, such as the partition function of an Argyres-Douglas gauge theory, the topological recursion partition function for the Weierstrass elliptic curve, and a 1-point conformal block on the Riemann sphere with an irregular insertion of rank $\frac52$. We review and further develop a mathematical framework for these constructions, and formulate conjectures on their equivalence. In particular, we give a simple explanation of the Fourier series representation of the tau function based on the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential extended to the space of Stokes data. We provide an algebraic construction of the rank $\frac52$ Whittaker state for the Virasoro algebra embedded into a rank $2$ Whittaker module, prove its existence and uniqueness, and fix its descendant structure. We also prove the conifold gap property of the relevant topological recursion partition function, which, on one hand, enables its efficient computation within the holomorphic anomaly approach and, on the other, establishes the existence of solution for the latter.</description>

      <title>The Gardner equation and acoustic solitary waves in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma are investigated where it is assumed that the ions follow a Cairns distribution and the electrons are Boltzmann distributed. Two theoretical methods are applied: Sagdeev pseudopotential analysis (SPA) and reductive perturbation theory (RPT). Since SPA incorporates all nonlinearities of the model it is the most accurate but deriving soliton profiles requires numerical integration of Poisson's equation. By contrast, RPT is a perturbation method which at second order yields the Gardner equation incorporating both the quadratic nonlinearity of the KdV equation with the cubic nonlinearity of the modified KdV equation. For consistency with the perturbation scheme the coefficient of the quadratic term needs to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of the cubic term. Solving the Gardner equation yields an analytic expression of the soliton profile. Selecting an appropriate set of compositional parameters, the soliton solutions obtained from SPA and RPT are analyzed and compared.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>
