      <title>$\omega$-weak equivalences between weak $\omega$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\omega$-weak equivalences between weak $\omega$-categories in the sense of Batanin-Leinster. Our $\omega$-weak equivalences are strict $\omega$-functors satisfying essential surjectivity at every dimension, and when restricted to those between strict $\omega$-categories, they coincide with the weak equivalences in the model category of strict $\omega$-categories defined by Lafont, M\'etayer, and Worytkiewicz. We show that the class of $\omega$-weak equivalences has the 2-out-of-3 property. We also consider a generalisation of $\omega$-weak equivalences, defined as weak $\omega$-functors (in the sense of Garner) satisfying essential surjectivity, and show that this class also has the 2-out-of-3 property.</description>

      <title>Non-additive derived functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F\colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{E}$ be a functor from a category $\mathcal{C}$ to a homological (Borceux-Bourn) or semi-abelian (Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen) category $\mathcal{E}$. We investigate conditions under which the homology of an object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with coefficients in the functor $F$, defined via projective resolutions in $\mathcal{C}$, remains independent of the chosen resolution. Consequently, the left derived functors of $F$ can be constructed analogously to the classical abelian case.
  Our approach extends the concept of chain homotopy to a non-additive setting using the technique of imaginary morphisms. Specifically, we utilize the approximate subtractions of Bourn-Janelidze, originally introduced in the context of subtractive categories. This method is applicable when $\mathcal{C}$ is a pointed regular category with finite coproducts and enough projectives, provided these projectives are closed under protosplit subobjects, a new condition introduced in this article and naturally satisfied in the abelian context. We further assume that the functor $F$ meets certain exactness conditions: for instance, it may be protoadditive and preserve proper morphisms and binary coproducts - conditions that amount to additivity when $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are abelian categories.
  Within this framework, we develop a basic theory of derived functors, compare it with the simplicial approach, and provide several examples.</description>

      <title>Inner automorphisms as 2-cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract inner automorphisms can be used to promote any category into a 2-category, and we study two-dimensional limits and colimits in the resulting 2-categories. Existing connected colimits and limits in the starting category become two-dimensional colimits and limits under fairly general conditions. Under the same conditions, colimits in the underlying category can be used to build many notable two-dimensional colimits such as coequifiers and coinserters. In contrast, disconnected colimits or genuinely 2-categorical limits such as inserters and equifiers and cotensors cannot exist unless no nontrivial abstract inner automorphisms exist and the resulting 2-category is locally discrete. We also study briefly when an ordinary functor can be extended to a 2-functor between the resulting 2-categories.</description>

      <title>Atomic Toposes with Co-Well-Founded Categories of Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atoms of the Schanuel topos can be described as the pairs $(n,G)$ where $n$ is a finite set and $G$ is a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(n)$. We give a general criterion on an atomic site ensuring that the atoms of the topos of sheaves on that site can be described in a similar fashion. We deduce that these toposes are locally finitely presentable. By applying this to the Malitz-Gregory atomic topos, we obtain a counter-example to the conjecture that every locally finitely presentable topos has enough points. We also work out a combinatorial property satisfied exactly when the sheaves for the atomic topology are the pullback-preserving functors. In this case, the category of atoms is particularly simple to describe.</description>

      <title>Stratification of Derived Categories of Tate Motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the localizing tensor ideals of the derived categories of mixed Tate motives over certain algebraically closed fields. More precisely, we prove that these categories are stratified in the sense of Barthel, Heard and Sanders. A key ingredient in the proof is the development of a new technique for transporting stratification between categories by means of Brown--Adams representability, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Computing the center of a fusion category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a (Las Vegas) algorithm for explicitly computing the simple objects of the categorical (Drinfeld) center of a spherical fusion category. Our approach is based on decomposing the images of simple objects under the induction functor from the category to its center. We have implemented this algorithm in a general-purpose software framework TensorCategories.jl for tensor categories that we develop within the open-source computer algebra system OSCAR. While the required computations are still too heavy to investigate standard examples whose center is not yet known up to some equivalence, our algorithm has the advantage of determining explicit half-braidings for the simple central objects, avoiding abstract equivalences and the like. Furthermore, it also works over not necessarily algebraically closed fields, and this yields new explicit examples of non-split modular categories.</description>

Abstract: We prove a decomposition of the Hochschild homology groups of the equivariant dg category $\mathscr{C}^G$ associated to a small dg category $\mathscr{C}$ with direct sums on which a finite group $G$ acts. When the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$ this decomposition is related to a categorical action of $\text{Rep}(G)$ on $\mathscr{C}^G$ and the resulting action of the representation ring $R_\mathbb{C}(G)$ on $HH_\bullet(\mathscr{C}^G)$.</description>

      <title>Model structure arising from one hereditary cotorsion pair on extriangulated categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a weakly idempotent complete extriangulated category. In contrast with the Hovey correspondence of admissible model structures on weakly idempotent complete exact categories from two complete cotorsion pairs, we give a construction of model structures on $\mathcal{C}$ from only one complete cotorsion pair. Our main result not only generalizes the work by Beligiannis-Reiten and Cui-Lu-Zhang, but also provides methods to construct model structures from silting objects of $\mathcal{C}$ and co-$t$-structures in triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Enriched concepts of regular logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our previous work on enriched universal algebra, we define a notion of enriched language consisting of function and relation symbols whose arities are objects of the base of enrichment. In this context, we construct atomic formulas and define the regular fragment of enriched logic by taking conjunctions and existential quantifications of those. We then characterize enriched categories of models of regular theories as enriched injectivity classes in the enriched category of structures. These notions rely on the choice of a factorization system on the base of enrichment which will be used to interpret relation symbols and existential quantifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tambara and Yamagami investigated a simple set of fusion rules with only one non-invertible object, and proved under which circumstances those rules could be given a coherent associator. We consider a generalization of such fusion rules to the setting where simple objects are no longer required to be split simple. Over the real numbers, this means that objects are either real, complex, or quaternionic. In this context, we prove a similar categorification result to the one of Tambara and Yamagami.</description>

      <title>Resolutions as directed colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>

      <title>Quantifier-free formulas and quantifier alternation depth in doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at providing a first step towards a doctrinal approach to quantifier-free formulas and quantifier alternation depth modulo a first-order theory.
  The set of quantifier-free formulas modulo a first-order theory is axiomatized by what we call a quantifier-free fragment of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Rather than being an intrinsic notion, a quantifier-free fragment is an additional structure on a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers. Under a smallness assumption, the structures occurring as quantifier-free fragments of some Boolean doctrines with quantifiers are precisely the Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers). To obtain this characterization, we prove that every Boolean doctrine over a small base category admits a quantifier completion, of which it is a quantifier-free fragment.
  Furthermore, the stratification by quantifier alternation depth of first-order formulas motivates the introduction of quantifier alternation stratified Boolean doctrines. While quantifier-free fragments are defined in relation to an "ambient" Boolean doctrine with quantifiers, a quantifier alternation stratified Boolean doctrine requires no such ambient doctrine. Indeed, it consists of a sequence of Boolean doctrines (without quantifiers) with connecting axioms. We show such sequences to be in one-to-one correspondence with pairs consisting of a Boolean doctrine with quantifiers and a quantifier-free fragment of it.</description>
