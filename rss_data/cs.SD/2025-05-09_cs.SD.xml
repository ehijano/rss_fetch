      <title>Data Standards in Audiology: A Mixed-Methods Exploration of Community Perspectives and Implementation Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore options for data standardisation in audiology and document the global audiology community's current knowledge and views of data standards, explore their needs and preferences, and develop recommendations for data standardisation as a result.
  Design: A mixed-methods approach, combining a structured survey with an in-depth exploration of themes by experts during a special session on "Big Data and Data Standards in Audiology" at the 2024 Virtual Conference of Computational Audiology.
  Study Sample: The survey sample consisted of 82 members of the global audiology community; five experts joined the panel discussion.
  Results: Survey results emphasized the need for data standardisation in audiology aimed at facilitating research and improving patient care. Knowledge of existing initiatives was low: 38% were aware of initiatives. Yet, 90% envisioned contributing to them moving forward. The panel discussion explored emerging standardisation initiatives in audiology (OMOP, openEHR, HIMSA's Noah standard), challenges (e.g., data quality and privacy), and opportunities (e.g., conversion between approaches and synergies with other medical fields).
  Conclusions: The community support identified in this study could be leveraged to further develop standardisation initiatives for audiology, ensuring alignment between initiatives and with other medical fields.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent AI Framework for Immersive Audiobook Production through Spatial Audio and Neural Narration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces an innovative AI-driven multi-agent framework specifically designed for creating immersive audiobooks. Leveraging neural text-to-speech synthesis with FastSpeech 2 and VALL-E for expressive narration and character-specific voices, the framework employs advanced language models to automatically interpret textual narratives and generate realistic spatial audio effects. These sound effects are dynamically synchronized with the storyline through sophisticated temporal integration methods, including Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Diffusion-based generative models combined with higher-order ambisonics (HOA) and scattering delay networks (SDN) enable highly realistic 3D soundscapes, substantially enhancing listener immersion and narrative realism. This technology significantly advances audiobook applications, providing richer experiences for educational content, storytelling platforms, and accessibility solutions for visually impaired audiences. Future work will address personalization, ethical management of synthesized voices, and integration with multi-sensory platforms.</description>

      <title>How to Infer Repeat Structures in MIDI Performances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIDI performances are generally expedient in performance research and music information retrieval, and even more so if they can be connected to a score. This connection is usually established by means of alignment, linking either notes or time points between the score and the performance. The first obstacle when trying to establish such an alignment is that a performance realizes one (out of many) structural versions of the score that can plausibly result from instructions such as repeats, variations, and navigation markers like 'dal segno/da capo al coda'. A score needs to be unfolded, that is, its repeats and navigation markers need to be explicitly written out to create a single timeline without jumps matching the performance, before alignment algorithms can be applied. In the curation of large performance corpora this process is carried out manually, as no tools are available to infer the repeat structure of the performance. To ease this process, we develop a method to automatically infer the repeat structure of a MIDI performance, given a symbolically encoded score including repeat and navigation markers. The intuition guiding our design is: 1) local alignment of every contiguous section of the score with a section of a performance containing the same material should receive high alignment gain, whereas local alignment with any other performance section should accrue a low or zero gain. And 2) stitching local alignments together according to a valid structural version of the score should result in an approximate full alignment and correspondingly high global accumulated gain if the structural version corresponds to the performance, and low gain for all other, ill-fitting structural versions.</description>

      <title>ReverbMiipher: Generative Speech Restoration meets Reverberation Characteristics Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberation encodes spatial information regarding the acoustic source environment, yet traditional Speech Restoration (SR) usually completely removes reverberation. We propose ReverbMiipher, an SR model extending parametric resynthesis framework, designed to denoise speech while preserving and enabling control over reverberation. ReverbMiipher incorporates a dedicated ReverbEncoder to extract a reverb feature vector from noisy input. This feature conditions a vocoder to reconstruct the speech signal, removing noise while retaining the original reverberation characteristics. A stochastic zero-vector replacement strategy during training ensures the feature specifically encodes reverberation, disentangling it from other speech attributes. This learned representation facilitates reverberation control via techniques such as interpolation between features, replacement with features from other utterances, or sampling from a latent space. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm ReverbMiipher effectively preserves reverberation, removes other artifacts, and outperforms the conventional two-stage SR and convolving simulated room impulse response approach. We further demonstrate its ability to generate novel reverberation effects through feature manipulation.</description>

      <title>Pairing Real-Time Piano Transcription with Symbol-level Tracking for Precise and Robust Score Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time music tracking systems follow a musical performance and at any time report the current position in a corresponding score. Most existing methods approach this problem exclusively in the audio domain, typically using online time warping (OLTW) techniques on incoming audio and an audio representation of the score. Audio OLTW techniques have seen incremental improvements both in features and model heuristics which reached a performance plateau in the past ten years. We argue that converting and representing the performance in the symbolic domain -- thereby transforming music tracking into a symbolic task -- can be a more effective approach, even when the domain transformation is imperfect. Our music tracking system combines two real-time components: one handling audio-to-note transcription and the other a novel symbol-level tracker between transcribed input and score. We compare the performance of this mixed audio-symbolic approach with its equivalent audio-only counterpart, and demonstrate that our method outperforms the latter in terms of both precision, i.e., absolute tracking error, and robustness, i.e., tracking success.</description>

      <title>FLAM: Frame-Wise Language-Audio Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-modal audio-language models (ALMs) excel at text-audio retrieval but struggle with frame-wise audio understanding. Prior works use temporal-aware labels or unsupervised training to improve frame-wise capabilities, but they still lack fine-grained labeling capability to pinpoint when an event occurs. While traditional sound event detection models can precisely localize events, they are limited to pre-defined categories, making them ineffective for real-world scenarios with out-of-distribution events. In this work, we introduce FLAM, an open-vocabulary contrastive audio-language model capable of localizing specific sound events. FLAM employs a memory-efficient and calibrated frame-wise objective with logit adjustment to address spurious correlations, such as event dependencies and label imbalances during training. To enable frame-wise supervision, we leverage a large-scale dataset with diverse audio events, LLM-generated captions and simulation. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that FLAM significantly improves the open-vocabulary localization capability while maintaining strong performance in global retrieval and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-body gestures play a pivotal role in natural interactions and are crucial for achieving effective communication. Nevertheless, most existing studies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the vital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore the dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective Communication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of listeners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion mechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns between speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction process, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively introduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising step size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not only dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also respond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic interaction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that compared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the model we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness, coherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the subjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated interaction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human communication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model outperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more powerful support for effective communication.</description>

      <title>Listen to Extract: Onset-Prompted Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose $\textit{listen to extract}$ (LExt), a highly-effective while extremely-simple algorithm for monaural target speaker extraction (TSE). Given an enrollment utterance of a target speaker, LExt aims at extracting the target speaker from the speaker's mixed speech with other speakers. For each mixture, LExt concatenates an enrollment utterance of the target speaker to the mixture signal at the waveform level, and trains deep neural networks (DNN) to extract the target speech based on the concatenated mixture signal. The rationale is that, this way, an artificial speech onset is created for the target speaker and it could prompt the DNN (a) which speaker is the target to extract; and (b) spectral-temporal patterns of the target speaker that could help extraction. This simple approach produces strong TSE performance on multiple public TSE datasets including WSJ0-2mix, WHAM! and WHAMR!.</description>

      <title>Normalize Everything: A Preconditioned Magnitude-Preserving Architecture for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for diffusion-based speech enhancement. Our method employs a Schroedinger bridge to transform the noisy speech distribution into the clean speech distribution. To stabilize and improve training, we employ time-dependent scalings of the inputs and outputs of the network, known as preconditioning. We consider two skip connection configurations, which either include or omit the current process state in the denoiser's output, enabling the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. Each approach leads to improved performance on different speech enhancement metrics. To maintain stable magnitude levels and balance during training, we use a magnitude-preserving network architecture that normalizes all activations and network weights to unit length. Additionally, we propose learning the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for effective input conditioning. After training, we apply a method to approximate different exponential moving average (EMA) profiles and investigate their effects on the speech enhancement performance. In contrast to image generation tasks, where longer EMA lengths often enhance mode coverage, we observe that shorter EMA lengths consistently lead to better performance on standard speech enhancement metrics. Code, audio examples, and checkpoints are available online.</description>

      <title>Hearing and Seeing Through CLIP: A Framework for Self-Supervised Sound Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models demonstrate strong multimodal alignment and generalization across diverse tasks. Among them, CLIP stands out as one of the most successful approaches. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP to sound source localization, proposing a self-supervised method operates without explicit text input. We introduce a framework that maps audios into tokens compatible with CLIP's text encoder, producing audio-driven embeddings. These embeddings are used to generate sounding region masks, from which visual features are extracted and aligned with the audio embeddings through a contrastive audio-visual correspondence objective. Our findings show that alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects. We further propose an LLM-guided extension that distills object-aware audio-visual scene understanding into the model during training to enhance alignment. Extensive experiments across five diverse tasks demonstrate that our method, in all variants, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves strong generalization in zero-shot settings.</description>

Abstract: This essay recounts my personal journey towards a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of algorithmic music composition. I do not spend much time on specific mathematical algorithms used by composers; rather, I focus on general issues such as fundamental limits and possibilities, by analogy with metalogic, metamathematics, and computability theory. I discuss implications from these foundations for the future of algorithmic composition.</description>

      <title>An Efficient GPU-based Implementation for Noise Robust Sound Source Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot audition, encompassing Sound Source Localization (SSL), Sound Source Separation (SSS), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), enables robots and smart devices to acquire auditory capabilities similar to human hearing. Despite their wide applicability, processing multi-channel audio signals from microphone arrays in SSL involves computationally intensive matrix operations, which can hinder efficient deployment on Central Processing Units (CPUs), particularly in embedded systems with limited CPU resources. This paper introduces a GPU-based implementation of SSL for robot audition, utilizing the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition-based Multiple Signal Classification (GSVD-MUSIC), a noise-robust algorithm, within the HARK platform, an open-source software suite. For a 60-channel microphone array, the proposed implementation achieves significant performance improvements. On the Jetson AGX Orin, an embedded device powered by an NVIDIA GPU and ARM Cortex-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPUs, we observe speedups of 5648.7x for GSVD calculations and 10.7x for the SSL module, while speedups of 4245.1x for GSVD calculation and 17.3x for the entire SSL module on a server configured with an NVIDIA A100 GPU and AMD EPYC 7352 CPUs, making real-time processing feasible for large-scale microphone arrays and providing ample capacity for real-time processing of potential subsequent machine learning or deep learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Cross-language Intelligibility Assessment of Dysarthric Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Speech intelligibility is a critical outcome in the assessment and management of dysarthria, yet most research and clinical practices have focused on English, limiting their applicability across languages. This commentary introduces a conceptual framework--and a demonstration of how it can be implemented--leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to advance cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech. Method: We propose a two-tiered conceptual framework consisting of a universal speech model that encodes dysarthric speech into acoustic-phonetic representations, followed by a language-specific intelligibility assessment model that interprets these representations within the phonological or prosodic structures of the target language. We further identify barriers to cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech, including data scarcity, annotation complexity, and limited linguistic insights into dysarthric speech, and outline potential AI-driven solutions to overcome these challenges. Conclusion: Advancing cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech necessitates models that are both efficient and scalable, yet constrained by linguistic rules to ensure accurate and language-sensitive assessment. Recent advances in AI provide the foundational tools to support this integration, shaping future directions toward generalizable and linguistically informed assessment frameworks.</description>
