      <title>Emerging AI-based weather prediction models as downscaling tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-resolution information on climate change is critical for accurate projections and decision-making. Presently, this need is addressed through high-resolution climate models or downscaling. High-resolution models are computationally demanding and creating ensemble simulations with them is typically prohibitively expensive. Downscaling methods are more affordable but are typically limited to small regions. This study proposes the use of existing AI-based numerical weather prediction systems (AI-NWP) to perform global downscaling of climate information from low-resolution climate models. Our results demonstrate that AI-NWP initalized from low-resolution initial conditions can develop detailed forecasts closely resembling the resolution of the training data using a one day lead time. We constructed year-long atmospheric fields using AI-NWP forecasts initialized from smoothed ERA5 and low-resolution CMIP6 models. Our analysis for 2-metre temperature indicates that AI-NWP can generate high-quality, long-term datasets and potentially perform bias correction, bringing climate model outputs closer to observed data. The study highlights the potential for off-the-shelf AI-NWP to enhance climate data downscaling, offering a simple and computationally efficient alternative to traditional downscaling techniques. The downscaled data can be used either directly for localized climate information or as boundary conditions for further dynamical downscaling.</description>

      <title>Similarity-Based Analysis of Atmospheric Organic Compounds for Machine Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of aerosol particles in the atmosphere impacts air quality and climate change, but many of the organic molecules involved remain unknown. Machine learning could aid in identifying these compounds through accelerated analysis of molecular properties and detection characteristics. However, such progress is hindered by the current lack of curated datasets for atmospheric molecules and their associated properties. To tackle this challenge, we propose a similarity analysis that connects atmospheric compounds to existing large molecular datasets used for machine learning development. We find a small overlap between atmospheric and non-atmospheric molecules using standard molecular representations in machine learning applications. The identified out-of-domain character of atmospheric compounds is related to their distinct functional groups and atomic composition. Our investigation underscores the need for collaborative efforts to gather and share more molecular-level atmospheric chemistry data. The presented similarity based analysis can be used for future dataset curation for machine learning development in the atmospheric sciences.</description>

      <title>The exponential Lagrangian mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian averaging is a valuable tool for the analysis and modelling of multiscale processes in fluid dynamics. The numerical computation of Lagrangian averages from simulation data is considered challenging, however. In response, we develop a straightforward form of Lagrangian (time) averaging -- exponential averaging -- and derive simple partial differential equations that govern the evolution of the Lagrangian mean fields. These equations can be solved at minimum cost as part of the numerical simulation of fluid models, using the same time and space discretisation as for the dynamical equations.
  We implement exponential averaging in the rotating shallow-water model and demonstrate its effectiveness at filtering out large-amplitude Poincar\'e waves while retaining the salient features of an underlying turbulent flow. We generalise the computation of exponential Lagrangian means from scalar to tensor fields and apply the generalisation to the computation of the Lagrangian mean momentum and of the related pseudomomentum.</description>

      <title>Towards diffusion models for large-scale sea-ice modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make the first steps towards diffusion models for unconditional generation of multivariate and Arctic-wide sea-ice states. While targeting to reduce the computational costs by diffusion in latent space, latent diffusion models also offer the possibility to integrate physical knowledge into the generation process. We tailor latent diffusion models to sea-ice physics with a censored Gaussian distribution in data space to generate data that follows the physical bounds of the modelled variables. Our latent diffusion models reach similar scores as the diffusion model trained in data space, but they smooth the generated fields as caused by the latent mapping. While enforcing physical bounds cannot reduce the smoothing, it improves the representation of the marginal ice zone. Therefore, for large-scale Earth system modelling, latent diffusion models can have many advantages compared to diffusion in data space if the significant barrier of smoothing can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Framework and Optimal Projection of Weather Fields for Prediction of Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme events are the major weather related hazard for humanity. It is then of crucial importance to have a good understanding of their statistics and to be able to forecast them. However, lack of sufficient data makes their study particularly challenging.
  In this work we provide a simple framework to study extreme events that tackles the lack of data issue by using the whole dataset available, rather than focusing on the extremes in the dataset. To do so, we make the assumption that the set of predictors and the observable used to define the extreme event follow a jointly Gaussian distribution. This naturally gives the notion of an optimal projection of the predictors for forecasting the event.
  We take as a case study extreme heatwaves over France, and we test our method on an 8000-year-long intermediate complexity climate model time series and on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset.
  For a-posteriori statistics, we observe and motivate the fact that composite maps of very extreme events look similar to less extreme ones.
  For prediction, we show that our method is competitive with off-the-shelf neural networks on the long dataset and outperforms them on reanalysis.
  The optimal projection pattern, which makes our forecast intrinsically interpretable, highlights the importance of soil moisture deficit and quasi-stationary Rossby waves as precursors to extreme heatwaves.</description>
