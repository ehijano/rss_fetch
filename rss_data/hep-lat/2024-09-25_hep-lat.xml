      <title>Vortex wall phase in fractonic XY-plaquette model on square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.</description>

      <title>Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in two-dimensional superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2d superfluid (complex $\phi ^4$ theory in two dimensions) undergoes Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by phase fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. We study the transition by Monte Carlo simulations and also develop an analytic approach based on the effective theory for the Goldstone mode.</description>

      <title>Numerical determination of the width and shape of the effective string using Stochastic Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based architectures have recently proved to be an efficient tool for numerical simulations of Effective String Theories regularized on the lattice that otherwise cannot be efficiently sampled by standard Monte Carlo methods. In this work we use Stochastic Normalizing Flows, a state-of-the-art deep-learning architecture based on non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations, to study different effective string models. After testing the reliability of this approach through a comparison with exact results for the Nambu-Got\={o} model, we discuss results on observables that are challenging to study analytically, such as the width of the string and the shape of the flux density. Furthermore, we perform a novel numerical study of Effective String Theories with terms beyond the Nambu-Got\={o} action, including a broader discussion on their significance for lattice gauge theories. These results establish the reliability and feasibility of flow-based samplers for Effective String Theories and pave the way for future applications on more complex models.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>

      <title>Partial-wave projection of relativistic three-body amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the integral equations for partial-wave projected three-body scattering amplitudes, starting from the integral equations for three-body amplitudes developed for lattice QCD analyses. The results, which hold for generic three-body systems of spinless particles, build upon the recently derived partial-wave projected one-particle exchange, a primary component of the relativistic framework proven to satisfy S matrix unitarity. We derive simplified expressions for factorizable short-distance interactions, $\mathcal{K}_{3}$, in two equivalent formalisms - one symmetric under particle interchange and one asymmetric. For the asymmetric case, we offer parameterizations useful for amplitude analysis. Finally, we examine toy models for $3\pi$ systems at unphysically heavy pion masses with total isospins 0,1, and 2.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effects on electroweak phase transition and baryon asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early universe, the first-order phase transition may occur in the background of magnetic fields, leading to baryon number asymmetry through chiral anomaly. We have numerically simulated the first-order electroweak phase transition in the background of a magnetic field in a three-dimensional lattice, discovered the phenomenon of Higgs condensation, and for the first time given the relationship between baryon number asymmetry and magnetic field strength. The magnetic field strength required to achieve the matter-antimatter asymmetry by the evolution of magnetohydrodynamics is about $10^{-17}\sim10^{-14}$ Gauss at present depending on the correlation length of the helical magnetic field. Our research provides a strong basis for explaining the baryon number asymmetry with cosmic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quantum criticality in the complex inverse temperature plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concepts of the complex partition functions and the Fisher zeros provide intrinsic statistical mechanisms for finite temperature and real time dynamical phase transitions. We extend the utility of these complexifications to quantum phase transitions. We exactly identify different Fisher zeros on lines or closed curves and elucidate their correspondence with domain-wall excitations or confined mesons for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. The crossover behavior of the Fisher zeros provides a fascinating picture for criticality near the quantum phase transition, where the excitation energy scales are quantitatively determined. We further confirm our results by tensor network calculations and demonstrate a clear signal of deconfined meson excitations from the disruption of the closed zero curves. Our results unambiguously show significant features of Fisher zeros for a quantum phase transition and open up a new route to explore quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>
