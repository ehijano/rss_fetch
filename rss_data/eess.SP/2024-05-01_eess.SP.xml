      <title>Robust Proximity Detection using On-Device Gait Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity detection in indoor environments based on WiFi signals has gained significant attention in recent years. Existing works rely on the dynamic signal reflections and their extracted features are dependent on motion strength. To address this issue, we design a robust WiFi-based proximity detector by considering gait monitoring. Specifically, we propose a gait score that accurately evaluates gait presence by leveraging the speed estimated from the autocorrelation function (ACF) of channel state information (CSI). By combining this gait score with a proximity feature, our approach effectively distinguishes different transition patterns, enabling more reliable proximity detection. In addition, to enhance the stability of the detection process, we employ a state machine and extract temporal information, ensuring continuous proximity detection even during subtle movements. Extensive experiments conducted in different environments demonstrate an overall detection rate of 92.5% and a low false alarm rate of 1.12% with a delay of 0.825s.</description>

      <title>Channel Performance Metrics and Evaluation for XR Head-Mounted Displays with mmWave Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology holds the potential to revolutionize head-mounted displays (HMDs) by enabling high-speed wireless communication with nearby processing nodes, where complex video rendering can take place. However, the sparse angular profile of mmWave channels, coupled with the narrow field of view (FoV) of patch-antenna arrays and frequent HMD rotation, can lead to poor performance.
  We introduce six channel performance metrics to evaluate the performance of an HMD equipped with mmWave arrays. We analyze the metrics using analytical models, discuss their impact for the application, and apply them to 28 GHz channel sounding data, collected in a conference room using eight HMD patch-antenna arrays, offset by 45 degrees from each other in azimuth.
  Our findings confirm that a single array performs poorly due to the narrow FoV, and featuring multiple arrays along the HMD's azimuth is required. Namely, the broader FoV stabilizes channel gain during HMD rotation, lessens the attenuation caused by line of sight (LoS) obstruction, and increases the channel's spatial multiplexing capability. In light of our findings, we conclude that it is imperative to either equip the HMD with multiple arrays or, as an alternative approach, incorporate macroscopic diversity by leveraging distributed access point (AP) infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Physical Layer Security with Deep SIMO Auto-Encoder and RF Impairments Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to achieving secure wireless communication by leveraging the inherent characteristics of wireless channels through end-to-end learning using a single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) autoencoder (AE). To ensure a more realistic signal transmission, we derive the signal model that captures all radio frequency (RF) hardware impairments to provide reliable and secure communication. Performance evaluations against traditional linear decoders, such as zero-forcing (ZR) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and the optimal nonlinear decoder, maximum likelihood (ML), demonstrate that the AE-based SIMO model exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance, but with a substantial gap even in the presence of RF hardware impairments. Additionally, the proposed model offers enhanced security features, preventing potential eavesdroppers from intercepting transmitted information and leveraging RF impairments for augmented physical layer security and device identification. These findings underscore the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end learning approach in achieving secure and robust wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Bit and Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication technology is regarded as a method surpassing the Shannon limit of bit transmission, capable of effectively enhancing transmission efficiency. However, current approaches that directly map content to transmission symbols are challenging to deploy in practice, imposing significant limitations on the development of semantic communication. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid bit and semantic communication system, named HybridBSC, in which encoded semantic information is inserted into bit information for transmission via conventional digital communication systems utilizing same spectrum resources. The system can be easily deployed using existing communication architecture to achieve bit and semantic information transmission. Particularly, we design a semantic insertion and extraction scheme to implement this strategy. Furthermore, we conduct experimental validation based on the pluto-based software defined radio (SDR) platform in a real wireless channel, demonstrating that the proposed strategy can simultaneously transmit semantic and bit information.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of An Indoor Localization Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian Indoor localization based on modalities available in modern smartphones have been widely studied in literature and many of the specific challenges have been addressed. However, very few approaches consider the whole problem and proposed solutions are very often evaluated under very limited scenarios. We propose a fusion engine for localization that makes use of various data provided by a smartphone (Inertial sensors, pressure sensors, Wi-Fi, BLE, GNSS, map etc.) to provide a fused localization that is robust under harsh conditions (poor RSS coverage, device position change etc.). Moreover, our solution has been evaluated for hardware integration and tested over a large database including more than 250 experiments representing different scenarios, showing feasibility of lightweight implementation and good results over various conditions.</description>

      <title>Radio Resource Management Design for RSMA: Optimization of Beamforming, User Admission, and Discrete/Continuous Rates with Imperfect SIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the radio resource management (RRM) design for multiuser rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), accounting for various characteristics of practical wireless systems, such as the use of discrete rates, the inability to serve all users, and the imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Specifically, failure to consider these characteristics in RRM design may lead to inefficient use of radio resources. Therefore, we formulate the RRM of RSMA as optimization problems to maximize respectively the weighted sum rate (WSR) and weighted energy efficiency (WEE), and jointly optimize the beamforming, user admission, discrete/continuous rates, accounting for imperfect SIC, which result in nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs that are challenging to solve. Despite the difficulty of the optimization problems, we develop algorithms that can find high-quality solutions. We show via simulations that carefully accounting for the aforementioned characteristics, can lead to significant gains. Precisely, by considering that transmission rates are discrete, the transmit power can be utilized more intelligently, allocating just enough power to guarantee a given discrete rate. Additionally, we reveal that user admission plays a crucial role in RSMA, enabling additional gains compared to random admission by facilitating the servicing of selected users with mutually beneficial channel characteristics. Furthermore, provisioning for possibly imperfect SIC makes RSMA more robust and reliable.</description>

      <title>A Fully Screen-Printed Vanadium-Dioxide Switches Based Wideband Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for 5G Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is attracting more and more research interest because of its ability to reprogram the radio environment. Designing and implementing the RIS, however, is challenging because of limitations of printed circuit board (PCB) technology related to manufacturing of large sizes as well as the cost of switches. Thus, a low-cost manufacturing process suitable for large size and volume of devices, such as screen-printing is necessary. In this paper, for the first time, a fully screen-printed reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with vanadium dioxide (VO2) switches for 5G and beyond communications is proposed. A VO2 ink has been prepared and batches of switches have been printed and integrated with the resonator elements. These switches are a fraction of the cost of commercial switches. Furthermore, the printing of these switches directly on metal patterns negates the need of any minute soldering of the switches. To avoid the complications of multilayer printing and realizing the RIS without vias, the resonators and the biasing lines are realized on a single layer. However, this introduces the challenge of interference between the biasing lines and the resonators, which is tackled in this work by designing the bias lines as part of the resonator. By adjusting the unit cell periodicity and the dimension of the H-shaped resonator, we achieve a 220 to 170{\deg} phase shift from 23.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz covering both n257 and n258 bands. Inside the wide bandwidth, the maximum ON reflection magnitude is 74%, and the maximum OFF magnitude is 94%. The RIS array comprises 20x20 unit cells (4.54x4.54{\lambda}^2 at 29.5 GHz). Each column of unit cells is serially connected to a current biasing circuit. To validate the array's performance, we conduct full-wave simulations as well as near-field and far-field measurements.</description>

      <title>Timely Status Updates in Slotted ALOHA Network With Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the age of information (AoI) in a scenario where energy-harvesting devices send status updates to a gateway following the slotted ALOHA protocol and receive no feedback. We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</description>

      <title>Learning Sparse High-Dimensional Matrix-Valued Graphical Models From Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a sparse, high-dimensional, stationary matrix-variate Gaussian time series. All past work on high-dimensional matrix graphical models assumes that independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations of the matrix-variate are available. Here we allow dependent observations. We consider a sparse-group lasso-based frequency-domain formulation of the problem with a Kronecker-decomposable power spectral density (PSD), and solve it via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. The problem is bi-convex which is solved via flip-flop optimization. We provide sufficient conditions for local convergence in the Frobenius norm of the inverse PSD estimators to the true value. This result also yields a rate of convergence. We illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Transmit Power Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient Internet of Things networks use low-cost, low-power backscatter tags in various industry applications. By exploiting those tags, we introduce the integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) system, featuring multiple backscatter tags, a user (reader), and a full-duplex base station (BS) that integrates sensing and (backscatter) communications. The BS undertakes dual roles of detecting backscatter tags and communicating with the user, leveraging the same temporal and frequency resources. The tag-reflected BS signals offer data to the user and enable the BS to sense the environment simultaneously. We derive both user and tag communication rates and the sensing rate of the BS. We jointly optimize the transmit/received beamformers and tag reflection coefficients to minimize the total BS power. To solve this problem, we employ the alternating optimization technique. We offer a closed-form solution for the received beamformers while utilizing semi-definite relaxation and slack-optimization for transmit beamformers and power reflection coefficients, respectively. For example, with ten transmit/reception antennas at the BS, ISABC delivers a 75% sum communication and sensing rates gain over a traditional backscatter while requiring a 3.4% increase in transmit power. Furthermore, ISABC with active tags only requires a 0.24% increase in transmit power over conventional integrated sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of eMBB+ and mMTC+ in Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of designing proper uplink multiple access (MA) schemes for coexistence between enhanced mobile broadband+ (eMBB+) users and massive machine-type communications+ (mMTC+) devices in a terminal-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Specifically, the use of a time-frequency spreading technique for the mMTC+ devices has been proposed. Coupled with the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge, closed-form bounds of the achievable (ergodic) rate for the two types of data services are derived. Using suitable power control mechanisms, we show it is possible to efficiently multiplex eMBB+ and mMTC+ traffic in the same time-frequency resource grid. Numerical experiments reveal interesting trade-offs in the selection of the spreading gain and the number of serving access points within the system. Results also demonstrate that the performance of the mMTC+ devices is slightly affected by the presence of the eMBB+ users. Overall, our approach can endow good quality of service to both 6G cornerstones at once.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Functional Connectivity and Graph Convolutional Network for Working Memory Load Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain responses related to working memory originate from distinct brain areas and oscillate at different frequencies. EEG signals with high temporal correlation can effectively capture these responses. Therefore, estimating the functional connectivity of EEG for working memory protocols in different frequency bands plays a significant role in analyzing the brain dynamics with increasing memory and cognitive loads, which remains largely unexplored. The present study introduces a Bayesian structure learning algorithm to learn the functional connectivity of EEG in sensor space. Next, the functional connectivity graphs are taken as input to the graph convolutional network to classify the working memory loads. The intrasubject (subject-specific) classification performed on 154 subjects for six different verbal working memory loads produced the highest classification accuracy of 96% and average classification accuracy of 89%, outperforming state-of-the-art classification models proposed in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian structure learning algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art functional connectivity estimation methods through intersubject and intrasubject statistical analysis of variance. The results also show that the alpha and theta bands have better classification accuracy than the beta band.</description>

      <title>Ultra Inertial Poser: Scalable Motion Capture and Tracking from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While camera-based capture systems remain the gold standard for recording human motion, learning-based tracking systems based on sparse wearable sensors are gaining popularity. Most commonly, they use inertial sensors, whose propensity for drift and jitter have so far limited tracking accuracy. In this paper, we propose Ultra Inertial Poser, a novel 3D full body pose estimation method that constrains drift and jitter in inertial tracking via inter-sensor distances. We estimate these distances across sparse sensor setups using a lightweight embedded tracker that augments inexpensive off-the-shelf 6D inertial measurement units with ultra-wideband radio-based ranging$-$dynamically and without the need for stationary reference anchors. Our method then fuses these inter-sensor distances with the 3D states estimated from each sensor Our graph-based machine learning model processes the 3D states and distances to estimate a person's 3D full body pose and translation. To train our model, we synthesize inertial measurements and distance estimates from the motion capture database AMASS. For evaluation, we contribute a novel motion dataset of 10 participants who performed 25 motion types, captured by 6 wearable IMU+UWB trackers and an optical motion capture system, totaling 200 minutes of synchronized sensor data (UIP-DB). Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance for our method over PIP and TIP, reducing position error from $13.62$ to $10.65cm$ ($22\%$ better) and lowering jitter from $1.56$ to $0.055km/s^3$ (a reduction of $97\%$).</description>

      <title>Scale-Robust Timely Asynchronous Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an asynchronous decentralized learning system, which consists of a network of connected devices trying to learn a machine learning model without any centralized parameter server. The users in the network have their own local training data, which is used for learning across all the nodes in the network. The learning method consists of two processes, evolving simultaneously without any necessary synchronization. The first process is the model update, where the users update their local model via a fixed number of stochastic gradient descent steps. The second process is model mixing, where the users communicate with each other via randomized gossiping to exchange their models and average them to reach consensus. In this work, we investigate the staleness criteria for such a system, which is a sufficient condition for convergence of individual user models. We show that for network scaling, i.e., when the number of user devices $n$ is very large, if the gossip capacity of individual users scales as $\Omega(\log n)$, we can guarantee the convergence of user models in finite time. Furthermore, we show that the bounded staleness can only be guaranteed by any distributed opportunistic scheme by $\Omega(n)$ scaling.</description>

      <title>A Joint Communication and Computation Design for Distributed RISs Assisted Probabilistic Semantic Communication in IIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of spectral-efficient communication and computation resource allocation for distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) in industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) is investigated. In the considered model, multiple RISs are deployed to serve multiple users, while PSC adopts compute-then-transmit protocol to reduce the transmission data size. To support high-rate transmission, the semantic compression ratio, transmit power allocation, and distributed RISs deployment must be jointly considered. This joint communication and computation problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the sum semantic-aware transmission rate of the system under total transmit power, phase shift, RIS-user association, and semantic compression ratio constraints. To solve this problem, a many-to-many matching scheme is proposed to solve the RIS-user association subproblem, the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed following greedy policy, while the phase shift of RIS can be optimized using the tensor based beamforming. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Learning for Radar Signal Characterisation</title>

Abstract: Radio signal recognition is a crucial task in both civilian and military applications, as accurate and timely identification of unknown signals is an essential part of spectrum management and electronic warfare. The majority of research in this field has focused on applying deep learning for modulation classification, leaving the task of signal characterisation as an understudied area. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an approach for tackling radar signal classification and characterisation as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem. We propose the IQ Signal Transformer (IQST) among several reference architectures that allow for simultaneous optimisation of multiple regression and classification tasks. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed MTL model on a synthetic radar dataset, while also providing a first-of-its-kind benchmark for radar signal characterisation.</description>

      <title>From OTFS to AFDM: A Comparative Study of Next-Generation Waveforms for ISAC in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless systems will offer integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) functionalities not only in order to enable new applications, but also as a means to mitigate challenges such as doubly-dispersive channels, which arise in high mobility scenarios and/or at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) bands. An emerging approach to accomplish these goals is the design of new waveforms, which draw from the inherent relationship between the doubly-dispersive nature of time-variant (TV) channels and the environmental features of scatterers manifested in the form of multi-path delays and Doppler shifts. Examples of such waveforms are the delay-Doppler domain orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and the recently proposed chirp domain affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), both of which seek to simultaneously combat the detrimental effects of double selectivity and exploit them for the estimation (or sensing) of environmental information. This article aims to provide a consolidated and comprehensive overview of the signal processing techniques required to support reliable ISAC over doubly-dispersive channels in beyond fifth generation (B5G)/sixth generation (6G) systems, with an emphasis on OTFS and AFDM waveforms, as those, together with the traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, suffice to elaborate on the most relevant properties of the trend. The analysis shows that OTFS and AFDM indeed enable significantly improved robustness against inter-carrier interference (ICI) arising from Doppler shifts compared to OFDM. In addition, the inherent delay-Doppler domain orthogonality of the OTFS and AFDM effective channels is found to provide significant advantages for the design and the performance of integrated sensing functionalities.</description>

      <title>Can We Improve Channel Reciprocity via Loop-back Compensation for RIS-assisted Physical Layer Key Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) facilitates the extraction of unpredictable channel features for physical layer key generation (PKG), securing communications among legitimate users with symmetric keys. Previous works have demonstrated that channel reciprocity plays a crucial role in generating symmetric keys in PKG systems, whereas, in reality, reciprocity is greatly affected by hardware interference and RIS-based jamming attacks. This motivates us to propose LoCKey, a novel approach that aims to improve channel reciprocity by mitigating interferences and attacks with a loop-back compensation scheme, thus maximizing the secrecy performance of the PKG system. Specifically, our proposed LoCKey is capable of effectively compensating for the CSI non-reciprocity by the combination of transmit-back signal value and error minimization module. Firstly, we introduce the entire flowchart of our method and provide an in-depth discussion of each step. Following that, we delve into a theoretical analysis of the performance optimizations when our LoCKey is applied for CSI reciprocity enhancement. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LoCKey in improving channel reciprocity under various interferences for RIS-assisted wireless communications. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in both the rate of key generation assisted by the RIS and the consistency of the generated keys, showing great potential for the practical deployment of our LoCKey in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Graph Heat Modelling for Diffusion-based Connectivity Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat diffusion describes the process by which heat flows from areas with higher temperatures to ones with lower temperatures. This concept was previously adapted to graph structures, whereby heat flows between nodes of a graph depending on the graph topology. Here, we combine the graph heat equation with the stochastic heat equation, which ultimately yields a model for multivariate time signals on a graph. We show theoretically how the model can be used to directly compute the diffusion-based connectivity structure from multivariate signals. Unlike other connectivity measures, our heat model-based approach is inherently multivariate and yields an absolute scaling factor, namely the graph thermal diffusivity, which captures the extent of heat-like graph propagation in the data. On two datasets, we show how the graph thermal diffusivity can be used to characterise Alzheimer's disease (AD). We find that the graph thermal diffusivity is lower for AD patients than healthy controls and correlates with mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores, suggesting structural impairment in patients in line with previous findings.</description>

      <title>Balancing Spectral, Temporal and Spatial Information for EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospect of future treatment warrants the development of cost-effective screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.</description>

      <title>Design of Artificial Interference Signals for Covert Communication Aided by Multiple Friendly Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a scenario of covert communication aided by multiple friendly interference nodes. The objective is to conceal the legitimate communication link under the surveillance of a warden. The main content is as follows: first, we propose a novel strategy for generating artificial noise signals in the considered covert scenario. Then, we leverage the statistical information of channel coefficients to optimize the basis matrix of the artificial noise signals space in the absence of accurate channel fading information between the friendly interference nodes and the legitimate receiver. The optimization problem aims to design artificial noise signals within the space to facilitate covert communication while minimizing the impact on the performance of legitimate communication. Second, a customized Rimannian Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (R-SVRG) algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem. In the algorithm, we employ the Riemannian optimization framework to analyze the geometric structure of the basis matrix constraints and transform the original non-convex optimization problem into an unconstrained problem on the complex Stiefel manifold for solution. Third, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point. In the end, we evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy for generating artificial noise signals through numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the Gaussian artificial noise strategy without optimization.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Near-Field Channel Estimation for Hybrid RIS Assisted Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the channel estimation (CE) problem for hybrid RIS assisted systems and focus on the near-field (NF) regime. Different from their far-field counterparts, NF channels possess a block-sparsity property, which is leveraged in the two developed CE algorithms: (i) boundary estimation and sub-vector recovery (BESVR) and (ii) linear total variation regularization (TVR). In addition, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers to reduce their computational complexity. Numerical results show that the linear TVR algorithm outperforms the chosen baseline schemes in terms of normalized mean square error in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime while the BESVR algorithm achieves comparable performance to the baseline schemes but with the added advantage of minimal CPU time.</description>

      <title>Dual-Functional Waveform Design with Local Sidelobe Suppression via OTFS Signaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is viewed as a key technology in future wireless networks. One of the main challenges in realizing ISAC is developing dual-functional waveforms that can communicate with communication receivers and perform radar sensing simultaneously. In this paper, we consider the joint design of a dual-functional orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) signal and a receiving filter for the ISAC system. The problem of ISAC waveform design is formulated as the minimization of the weighted integrated sidelobe level (WISL) of the ambiguity function and the interference term from ISAC waveform, with constraints on signal-to-noise ratio loss. The majorization-minimization algorithm combined with alternating iterative minimization is implemented to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that the WISL and the interference term can be significantly decreased to guarantee achievable data rates and detection performance.</description>

      <title>Secure SWIPT in the Multiuser STAR-RIS Aided MISO Rate Splitting Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have emerged as a novel technology that provides 360 coverage and new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). They are also capable of manipulating signal propagation and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). This paper introduces a novel STAR-RIS-aided secure SWIPT system for downlink multiple input single output rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks. The transmitter concurrently communicates with the information receivers (IRs) and sends energy to untrusted energy receivers (UERs). The UERs are also capable of wiretapping the IR streams. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) of the IRs is known at the information transmitter, but only imperfect CSI for the UERs is available at the energy transmitter. By exploiting RSMA, the base station splits the messages of the IRs into common and private parts. The former is encoded into a common stream that can be decoded by all IRs, while the private messages are individually decoded by their respective IRs. We find the precoders and STAR-RIS configuration that maximizes the achievable worst-case sum secrecy rate of the IRs under a total transmit power constraint, a sum energy constraint for the UERs, and subject to constraints on the transmission and reflection coefficients. The formulated problem is non-convex and has intricately coupled variables. To tackle this challenge, a suboptimal two-step iterative algorithm based on the sequential parametric convex approximation method is proposed. Simulations demonstrate that the RSMA-based algorithm implemented with a STAR-RIS enhances both the rate of confidential information transmission and the total spectral efficiency. Furthermore, our method surpasses the performance of both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-OMA (NOMA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. This work focuses the discussion on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the Floquet direction considered. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <title>Evaluating ROCKET and Catch22 features for calf behaviour classification from accelerometer data using Machine Learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring calf behaviour continuously would be beneficial to identify routine practices (e.g., weaning, dehorning, etc.) that impact calf welfare in dairy farms. In that regard, accelerometer data collected from neck collars can be used along with Machine Learning models to classify calf behaviour automatically. Hand-crafted features are commonly used in Machine Learning models, while ROCKET and Catch22 features are specifically designed for time-series classification problems in related fields. This study aims to compare the performance of ROCKET and Catch22 features to Hand-Crafted features. 30 Irish Holstein Friesian and Jersey pre-weaned calves were monitored using accelerometer sensors allowing for 27.4 hours of annotated behaviors. Additional time-series were computed from the raw X, Y and Z-axis and split into 3-second time windows. ROCKET, Catch22 and Hand-Crafted features were calculated for each time window, and the dataset was then split into the train, validation and test sets. Each set of features was used to train three Machine Learning models (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and RidgeClassifierCV) to classify six behaviours indicative of pre-weaned calf welfare (drinking milk, grooming, lying, running, walking and other). Models were tuned with the validation set, and the performance of each feature-model combination was evaluated with the test set. The best performance across the three models was obtained with ROCKET [average balanced accuracy +/- standard deviation] (0.70 +/- 0.07), followed by Catch22 (0.69 +/- 0.05), surpassing Hand-Crafted (0.65 +/- 0.034). The best balanced accuracy (0.77) was obtained with ROCKET and RidgeClassifierCV, followed by Catch22 and Random Forest (0.73). Thus, tailoring these approaches for specific behaviours and contexts will be crucial in advancing precision livestock farming and enhancing animal welfare on a larger scale.</description>
