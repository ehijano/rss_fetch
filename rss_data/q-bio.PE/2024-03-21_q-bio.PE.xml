      <title>Interspecific dispersal constraints suppress pattern formation in metacommunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decisions to disperse from a habitat stand out among organismal behaviors as pivotal drivers of ecosystem dynamics across scales. Encounters with other species are an important component of adaptive decision-making in dispersal, resulting in widespread behaviors like tracking resources or avoiding consumers in space. Despite this, metacommunity models often treat dispersal as a function of intraspecific density alone. We show, focusing initially on three-species network motifs, that interspecific dispersal rules generally drive a transition in metacommunities from homogeneous steady states to self-organized heterogeneous spatial patterns. However, when ecologically realistic constraints reflecting adaptive behaviors are imposed -- prey tracking and predator avoidance -- a pronounced homogenizing effect emerges where spatial pattern formation is suppressed. We demonstrate this effect for each motif by computing master stability functions that separate the contributions of local and spatial interactions to pattern formation. We extend this result to species rich food webs using a random matrix approach, where we find that eventually webs become large enough to override the homogenizing effect of adaptive dispersal behaviors, leading once again to predominately pattern forming dynamics. Our results emphasize the critical role of interspecific dispersal rules in shaping spatial patterns across landscapes, highlighting the need to incorporate adaptive behavioral constraints in efforts to link local species interactions and metacommunity structure.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation from Single Patient, Single Time-Point Sequencing Data of Recurrent Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop consistent estimators for key parameters that govern the dynamics of tumor cell populations when subjected to pharmacological treatments. While these treatments often lead to an initial reduction in the abundance of drug-sensitive cells, a population of drug-resistant cells frequently emerges over time, resulting in cancer recurrence. Samples from recurrent tumors present as an invaluable data source that can offer crucial insights into the ability of cancer cells to adapt and withstand treatment interventions. To effectively utilize the data obtained from recurrent tumors, we derive several large number limit theorems, specifically focusing on the metrics that quantify the clonal diversity of cancer cell populations at the time of cancer recurrence. These theorems then serve as the foundation for constructing our estimators. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that our estimators only require a single time-point sequencing data from a single tumor, thereby enhancing the practicality of our approach and enabling the understanding of cancer recurrence at the individual level.</description>

      <title>Approximating reproduction numbers: a general numerical method for age-structured models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general numerical method to approximate the reproduction numbers of a large class of multi-group, age-structured, population models with a finite age span. To provide complete flexibility in the definition of the birth and transition processes, we propose an equivalent formulation for the age-integrated state within the extended space framework. Then, we discretize the birth and transition operators via pseudospectral collocation. We discuss applications to epidemic models with continuous and piecewise continuous rates, with different interpretations of the age variable (e.g., demographic age, infection age and disease age) and the transmission terms (e.g., horizontal and vertical transmission). The tests illustrate that the method can compute different reproduction numbers, including the basic and type reproduction numbers as special cases.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the maximum parsimony tree for data with few substitutions within the NNI neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating species relationship trees, so-called phylogenetic trees, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated).
  On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present manuscript to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt; \frac{n}{8}+\frac{6}{5}-\frac{1}{10} \sqrt{\frac{5}{16} n^2+4}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;8 k-\frac{46}{5}+\frac{2}{5} \sqrt{40 k-31} $), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on a given tree $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively.</description>

      <title>An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.</description>
