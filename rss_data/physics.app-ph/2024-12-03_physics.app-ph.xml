      <title>A Light-Emitting-Diodes-Integrated Silicon Carbide Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A light-emitting-diodes (LEDs)-integrated silicon carbide (SiC) insulated gate bipolar transistors (LI-IGBT) is proposed in this paper. The novelty of the LI-IGBT depends on the photogeneration effect of III-nitride LEDs embedded in the poly-Si regions of IGBT. Then, the photogenerated carriers are formed in the JFET region and the drift layer, indicating the increase of the conductivity in LI-IGBT as compared with the SiC IGBT with hole-barrier layer (H-IGBT) and the SiC IGBT with charge storage layer (CSL-IGBT). The static simulation results show that the electron density of the LI-IGBT at the middle of the drift layer is separately 17.44 times and 15.81 times higher than those of the H-IGBT and CSL-IGBT, yielding 40.91% and 37.38% reduction of forward voltage drop, respectively, and also, the LI-IGBT shows 304.59% and 263.67% improvements in BFOM as compared with CSL-IGBT and H-IGBT, respectively. For the dynamic simulation in one cycle, the loss of LI-IGBT is separately reduced by 6.57% and 8.57% compared to H-IGBT and CSL-IGBT. Meanwhile, the relationship between VC(sat) and Eturn-off can be optimized by adjusting collector doping and minority carrier lifetime. These results reveal that the proposed SiC IGBT will be more suitable for ultra-high voltage application.</description>

      <title>Invisible Hydrodynamic Tweezers Based on Near-Zero Index Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating particles, such as cells and tissues, in a flowing liquid environment is crucial for life science research. Traditional contactless tweezers, although widely used for single-cell manipulation, face several challenges. These include potential damage to the target, restriction to static environments, complex excitation setups, and interference outside the target area. To address these issues, we propose an ``invisible hydrodynamic tweezer'' utilizing near-zero index hydrodynamic metamaterials. This metamaterial-based device creates an equipotential resistance zone, effectively immobilizing particles in flowing fluids without disturbing the external flow field and without causing damage to the targets. Unlike traditional active control methods, our tweezer passively captures and releases particles by adjusting the flow channel, eliminating the need for continuous and stable excitation devices, thereby significantly simplifying the setup complexity. Furthermore, these tweezers can be modularly designed in different sizes to flexibly accommodate various application needs. Simulations and experimental validations demonstrated the non-interfering, stable trapping, and precise movement capabilities of these tweezers. This proposed technique holds significant potential for applications in biomedicine, microfluidics, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>LPCVD Grown Si-Doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Films with Promising Electron Mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigated the growth of Si-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films using LPCVD system, achieving high electron mobilities of 162 cm$^2$/V.s and 149 cm$^2$/V.s at carrier concentrations of $1.51 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, for homoepitaxial (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates and heteroepitaxial (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on off-axis c-sapphire substrates with 6{\deg} miscut, representing the highest mobilities reported for LPCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ materials. Carrier concentrations were precisely tuned by varying SiCl$_4$ flow rates at a growth temperature of 1000{\deg}C, resulting in concentrations ranging from $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ to $1.19 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, as confirmed by both Hall and C-V measurements. The films exhibited high crystalline quality, confirmed by high-resolution XRD and Raman spectroscopy, indicating phase purity and structural integrity. Surface morphologies characterized by FESEM and AFM imaging showed a strong correlation between carrier concentrations and surface smoothness, with lower concentrations resulting in reduced RMS roughness. SIMS analysis revealed uniform Si incorporation, with low carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine impurities below detection limits, indicating high purity of the films. A high low-temperature peak mobility exceeding 843 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s was achieved for (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films at 80 K, highlighting the high purity and low compensation of these films. These findings emphasize the potential of LPCVD growth system for producing high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with thickness ranging between ~2.3-11.7 $\mu$m and faster growth rates (~4.7-17 $\mu$m/hr), promising transport properties, controllable doping, and scalability for developing high power vertical devices.</description>

      <title>Rapid Trapping and Label-free Characterization of Single Nanoscale Extracellular Vesicles and Nanoparticles in Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-throughput, comprehensive analysis of single nanoparticles to determine their size, shape, and composition is essential for understanding particle heterogeneity with applications ranging from drug delivery to environmental monitoring. Existing techniques are hindered by low throughput, lengthy trapping times, irreversible particle adsorption, or limited characterization capabilities. Here, we introduce Interferometric Electrohydrodynamic Tweezers (IET), an integrated platform that rapidly traps single nanoparticles in parallel within three seconds. IET enables label-free characterization of particle size and shape via interferometric imaging and identifies molecular composition through Raman spectroscopy, all without the need for fluorescent labeling. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by trapping and imaging colloidal polymer beads, nanoscale extracellular vesicles (EVs), and newly discovered extracellular nanoparticles known as supermeres. By monitoring their interferometric contrast images while trapped, we accurately determine the sizes of EVs and supermeres. Our IET represents a powerful optofluidics platform for comprehensive characterization of nanoscale objects, opening new avenues in nanomedicine, environmental monitoring, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Surface chemistry-based continuous separation of polystyrene particles in a microchannel via diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles is of great importance in many fields, such as chemistry, medicine, and chemical engineering. However, separating particles based on their surface physico-chemical properties remains challenging. Diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis have been used for the continuous separation of colloids based on particle size and zeta potential. Here, we demonstrate that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis in electrolyte streams enable the separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. A double junction microfluidic device, fed with low and high electrolyte concentration streams, was used to create steady-state salt concentration gradients. As the streams mix along the channel, the particles are exposed to environments with varying salinity levels, and their dynamics are influenced by the sensitivity of their zeta potential to the local salt concentration. Typically, for carboxylate polystyrene particles, the magnitude of the electrophoretically measured zeta potential decreases with increasing salt concentrations. However, surface conductance effects, which depend on the surface concentration of the carboxyl groups, may lead to an opposite sensitivity of the zeta potential to salt. Therefore, under selected salt conditions, similarly sized polystyrene colloids with comparable zeta potentials in the low concentration stream, but different surface concentrations of carboxyl groups, can be separated in a continuous flow process when they exhibit opposite zeta potential sensitivities to salt. This mechanism has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface physico-chemical properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.</description>

      <title>Computing the multimodal stochastic dynamics of a nanobeam in a viscous fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of small elastic objects in fluid are central to many important and emerging technologies. It is now possible to measure and use the higher modes of motion of elastic structures when driven by Brownian motion alone. Although theoretical descriptions exist for idealized conditions, computing the stochastic multimodal dynamics for the complex conditions of experiment is very challenging. We show that this is possible using deterministic finite element calculations with the fluctuation dissipation theorem by exploring the multimodal stochastic dynamics of a doubly-clamped nanobeam. We use a very general, and flexible, finite-element computational approach to quantify the stochastic dynamics of multiple modes simultaneously using only a single deterministic simulation. We include the experimentally relevant features of an intrinsic tension in the beam and the influence of a nearby rigid boundary on the dynamics through viscous fluid interactions. We quantify the stochastic dynamics of the first eleven flexural modes of the beam when immersed in air or water. We compare the numerical results with theory, where possible, and find excellent agreement. We quantify the limitations of the computational approach and describe its range of applicability. These results pave the way for computational studies of the stochastic dynamics of complex 3D elastic structures in a viscous fluid where theoretical descriptions are not available.</description>

      <title>Controller-decoder system requirements derived by implementing Shor's algorithm with surface code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is widely regarded as the most promising path towards quantum advantage, with significant advances in QEC codes, decoding algorithms, and physical implementations. The success of QEC relies on achieving quantum gate fidelities below the error threshold of the QEC code, while accurately decoding errors through classical processing of the QEC stabilizer measurements. In this paper, we uncover the critical system-level requirements from a controller-decoder system (CDS) necessary to successfully execute the next milestone in QEC, a non-Clifford circuit. Using a representative non-Clifford circuit, of Shor factorization algorithm for the number 21, we convert the logical-level circuit to a QEC surface code circuit and finally to the physical level circuit. By taking into account all realistic implementation aspects using typical superconducting qubit processor parameters, we reveal a broad range of core requirements from any CDS aimed at performing error corrected quantum computation. Our findings indicate that the controller-decoder closed-loop latency must remain within tens of microseconds, achievable through parallelizing decoding tasks and ensuring fast communication between decoders and the controller. Additionally, by extending existing simulation techniques, we simulate the complete fault-tolerant factorization circuit at the physical level, demonstrating that near-term hardware performance, such as a physical error rate of 0.1% and 1000 qubits, are sufficient for the successful execution of the circuit. These results are general to any non-Clifford QEC circuit of the same scale, providing a comprehensive overview of the classical components necessary for the experimental realization of non-Clifford circuits with QEC.</description>

      <title>Conversion of intense laser pulses into electromagnetic fields with use of extended targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects leading to generation of quasi-stationary and propagating electromagnetic fields during the propagation of a laser-driven current discharge pulse in extended targets are considered. The results of numerical modeling describe the interaction of a relativistically intense ultrashort laser pulse with an extended dense target and its transformation into a powerful discharge current pulse. It is shown that under certain conditions such a pulse can be used to generate strong electromagnetic fields with certain spatio-temporal properties. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the discharge pulse parameters on the properties of the induced electromagnetic fields. Analysis of the discharge current profile in dependence on the target thickness is provided and the dynamics of discharge current pulse profile evolution is studied on the time scale $\sim 10$ ps, when the propagation distance is $\sim 3$ mm.</description>

      <title>Measurements of absolute bandgap deformation-potentials of optically-bright bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides show many exciting features, including long-lived interlayer excitons and wide bandgap tunability using strain. Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</description>

      <title>A negative index metamaterial driven by phonons on a ZnO platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative index metamaterials (NIMs) can be achieved with uniaxial hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) featuring $\epsilon_{parallel}&gt;0$ and $\epsilon_{perpendicular}&lt;0$. This type of approach has been traditionally realized using stacked doped/undoped semiconductor layers. Only recently surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising low-loss alternative to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Despite this advantage, the SPhP-based approach has been underexplored due to the challenges associated with ensuring high crystal quality in the heterostructure when using alloys with different phonon frequencies. In this work, we design a phononic-driven NIM using a ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O heterostructure, demonstrating control over its hyperbolic behavior through the precise selection of the Mg content and the relative layer thicknesses. Our study shows that increasing the Mg content in the ternary layers enhances the type I behavior, and that the optimal layer thickness varies depending on the Mg content. After analyzing the conditions for achieving type I hyperbolic dispersion, we experimentally demonstrate this concept with a sample featuring equal layer thicknesses and a 32% Mg concentration. We characterize the structure by means of polarized reflectance spectroscopy and use attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy to report the presence of a SPhP mode located within the type I hyperbolic region. By employing the transfer matrix method, we demonstrate that this mode exhibits negative frequency dispersion, a hallmark of type I hyperbolic modes, and isofrequency curve calculations further confirm this behavior. Controlling the design of a phononic hyperbolic type I metamaterial lays the groundwork for exploring its potential applications in attaining low-loss, sub-diffraction-limited optical modes using SPhP excitations.</description>

      <title>Brownian spin-locking effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian systems are characterized by spatiotemporal disorder, which arises from the erratic motion of particles driven by thermal fluctuations. When light interacts with such systems, it typically produces unpolarized and uncorrelated fields. Here, we report the observation of a large-scale spin-locking effect of light within a Brownian medium. In an observation direction perpendicular to the incident wave momentum, scattering naturally divides into two diffusion regions, each associated with an opposite spin from the Brownian nanoparticles. This effect arises from the intrinsic spin-orbit interactions of scattering from individual nanoparticles, which ubiquitously generate radiative spin fields that propagate through the Brownian medium with multiple incoherent scattering. It offers a novel experimental platform for exploring macroscale spin behaviors of diffused light, with potential applications in precision metrology for measuring various nanoparticle properties. Our findings may inspire the study of analogous phenomena for different waves from novel spin-orbit interactions in complex disordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a systematic implementation of hybrid quantum-classical computational methods for investigating corrosion inhibition mechanisms on aluminum surfaces. We present an integrated workflow combining density functional theory (DFT) with quantum algorithms through an active space embedding scheme, specifically applied to studying 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol inhibitors on Al111 surfaces. Our implementation leverages the ADAPT-VQE algorithm with benchmarking against classical DFT calculations, achieving binding energies of -0.386 eV and -1.279 eV for 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol, respectively. The enhanced binding energy of the thiol derivative aligns with experimental observations regarding sulfur-functionalized inhibitors' improved corrosion protection. The methodology employs the orb-d3-v2 machine learning potential for rapid geometry optimizations, followed by accurate DFT calculations using CP2K with PBE functional and Grimme's D3 dispersion corrections. Our benchmarking on smaller systems reveals that StatefulAdaptVQE implementation achieves a 5-6x computational speedup while maintaining accuracy. This work establishes a workflow for quantum-accelerated materials science studying periodic systems, demonstrating the viability of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for studying surface-adsorbate interactions in corrosion inhibition applications. In which, can be transferable to other applications such as carbon capture and battery materials studies.</description>

As slow thermal dynamics of extended systems are expected to limit modulation speeds ultimately, research has primarily focused on steady-state effects. In this study, we investigate photo-driven TONL in amorphous silicon (a-Si) metasurfaces both under steady-state and, most importantly, dynamic conditions (50 kHz modulation) using a 488 nm continuous-wave pump laser. First, we show that a non-monotonic change in the steady-state transmission occurs at wavelengths longer than the electric-dipole resonance (800 nm). In particular, at 815 nm transmission first decreases by 30% and then increases by 30% as the laser intensity is raised to 5 mW/{\mu}m2. Next, we demonstrate that TONL decouple the thermal and optical characteristic times, the latter being up to 7 times shorter in the tested conditions (i.e {\tau}opt =0.5 {\mu}s vs {\tau}th =3.5 {\mu}s). Most remarkably, we experimentally demonstrate that combining these two effects enables optical modulation at twice the speed (100 kHz) of the excitation laser modulation. We finally show how to achieve all-optical transmission modulation at MHz speeds with large amplitudes (85%). Overall, these results show that photo-driven TONL produce large and fully reversible transmission modulation in dielectric metasurfaces with fast and adjustable speeds. Therefore, they open completely new opportunities toward exploiting TONL in dynamically reconfigurable systems, from optical switching to wavefront manipulation.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas: Foe, but also Friend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), surfaces patterned with reconfigurable metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that couple waves from waveguides or cavities to free space, are a promising technology to realize 6G wireless base stations and access points with low cost and power consumption. Mutual coupling between the DMA's meta-atoms results in a non-linear dependence of the radiation pattern on the DMA configuration, significantly complicating modeling and optimization. Therefore, mutual coupling has to date been considered a vexing nuance that is frequently neglected in theoretical studies and deliberately mitigated in experimental prototypes. Here, we demonstrate the overlooked property of mutual coupling to boost the control over the DMA's radiation pattern. Based on a physics-compliant DMA model, we demonstrate that the radiation pattern's sensitivity to the DMA configuration significantly depends on the mutual coupling strength. We further evidence how the enhanced sensitivity under strong mutual coupling translates into a higher fidelity in radiation pattern synthesis, benefiting applications ranging from dynamic beamforming to end-to-end optimized sensing and imaging. Our insights suggest that DMA design should be fundamentally rethought to embrace the benefits of mutual coupling. We also discuss ensuing future research directions related to the frugal characterization of DMAs based on compact physics-compliant models.</description>

      <title>Transistors based on Novel 2-D Monolayer Semiconductors Bi2O2Se, InSe, and MoSi2N4 for Enhanced Logic Density Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making ultra-short gate-length transistors significantly contributes to scaling the contacted gate pitch. This, in turn, plays a vital role in achieving smaller standard logic cells for enhanced logic density scaling. As we push the boundaries of miniaturization, it is intriguing to consider that the ultimate limit of contacted gate pitch could be reached with remarkable 1 nm gate-length transistors. Here, we identify InSe, Bi2O2Se, and MoSi2N4 as potential two-dimensional semiconductors for 1 nm transistors with low contact resistance and outstanding interface properties. We employ a fully self-consistent ballistic quantum transport model starting from first-principle calculations. Our simulations show that the interplay between electrostatics and quantum tunneling influences the performance of these devices over the device design space. MoSi2N4 channels have the best immunity to quantum tunneling, and Bi2O2Se channel devices have the best electrostatics. We show that for a channel length of 12 nm, all the devices can deliver I_$ON$/I_$OFF$ &gt; 10^3 , suitable for electronic applications, and Bi2O2Se is the best-performing channel material.</description>

      <title>A Universal Localized Failure Mechanism for Real Cylindrical Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From cell development to space rockets, the mechanical stability of thin shells is crucial across many industrial and natural processes. However, predicting shells' failure properties remains an open challenge, owing to their sensitivity to imperfections inevitably present in real structures. Existing predictive methods are informed by classical stability analyses of idealized shells, which associate shell buckling with a spontaneously emerging delocalized buckling mode. Here, we show through experimental and numerical observations how realistic geometric imperfections instead result in a universal localized buckling mode. The profile of this mode is robust across shells despite their differing underlying defect structures. Further contrasting with classical predictions, a real shell's equilibrium surface deformations grow in the shape of this universal localized mode even at stable loads well before failure. Our findings show that these complex nonlinear dynamics for loads below buckling are described by a 1-D relationship for structures buckling from a saddle-node bifurcation instability. This breakthrough provides a simplified yet general understanding of buckling mechanisms, leading to improved non-destructive predictive methods. To showcase these applications, we experimentally implement a lateral-probing technique that predicts the buckling loads of several unmodified shells to within 1% of the correct value.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for continuous uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following seminal work in the early 1980s that established the existence and representations of the homogenized transport coefficients for two phase random media, we develop a mathematical framework that provides Stieltjes integral representations for the bulk transport coefficients for uniaxial polycrystalline materials, involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators, which are compositions of non-random and random projection operators. We demonstrate the same mathematical framework also describes two-component composites, with a simple substitution of the random projection operator, making the mathematical descriptions of these two distinct physical systems directly analogous to one another. A detailed analysis establishes the operators arising in each setting are indeed self-adjoint on an $L^2$-type Hilbert space, providing a rigorous foundation to the formal spectral theoretic framework established by Golden and Papanicolaou in 1983. An abstract extension of the Helmholtz theorem also leads to integral representations for the inverses of effective parameters, e.g., effective conductivity and resistivity. An alternate formulation of the effective parameter problem in terms of a Sobolev-type Hilbert space provides a rigorous foundation for an approach first established by Bergman and Milton. We show that the correspondence between the two formulations is a one-to-one isometry. Rigorous bounds that follow from such Stieltjes integrals and partial knowledge about the material geometry are reviewed and validated by numerical calculations of the effective parameters for polycrystalline media.</description>

Abstract: The intensive study of non-collinear magnets promotes an urgent demand for the quantitative characterization of the non-collinear magnetic structures, which host numerous exotic phenomena. Here we systematically study the non-collinear magnetic structure of an artificial ferrimagnetic multilayer. The AMR measurements reveal two distinct twisted states whose magnetic structures can be quantitatively characterized with the assistance of micromagnetic simulations. Our results manifest AMR as an ideal probe of the non-collinear magnetic structure in artificial ferrimagnets.</description>

      <title>One-step Fabrication of Sharp Platinum/Iridium Tips via Amplitude-Modulated Alternating-Current Electropolishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) alloy tip for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was successfully fabricated by amplitude-modulated alternating-current (AC) electropolishing. The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the 1000 Hz sinusoidal voltage with amplitude modulation of the sinusoidal wave of 100 Hz in $\mathrm{CaCl_2}$/$\mathrm{H_2O}$/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT) showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The STM imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus AFM analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic waves to monitor active THz metagrating based on VO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a new approach to in-situ monitor the altered states of pixels in VO2 based active THz amplitude metagrating by using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated in LiNbO3 substrate. A single broadband RF response of the SAW device consists of N narrowband frequency channels which code the feedback information on the current pixels states. This way the resistance alteration due to metal-to-insulator transition of all VO2 based pixels of the active THz grating is monitored in advance even without incident radiation. The method provides important new options of monitoring a metasurface aging as well as incorrect switching related to technological defects. Using of the SAW device in all-electrically addressed VO2 based binary grating with tunable period as well as advanced gradient type gratings are modeled.</description>

Abstract: Full-vectorial finite difference method with perfectly matched layers boundaries is used to identify the single mode operation region of submicron rib waveguides fabricated using sili-con-on-insulator material system. Achieving high mode power confinement factors is emphasized while maintaining the single mode operation. As opposed to the case of large cross-section rib waveguides, theoretical single mode conditions have been demonstrated to hold for sub-micron waveguides with accuracy approaching 100%. Both, the deeply and the shallowly etched rib waveguides have been considered and the single mode condition for entire sub-micrometer range is presented while adhering to design specific mode confinement requirements.</description>

      <title>Full 3D Model of Modulation Efficiency of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Compatible, Submicron, Interleaved Junction Optical Phase Shifters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance optimization associated with optical modulators requires reasonably accurate predictive models for key figures of merit. Interleaved PN-junction topology offers the maximum mode/junction overlap and is the most efficient modulator in depletion-mode of operation. Due to its structure, the accurate modelling process must be fully three-dimensional, which is a nontrivial computational problem. This paper presents a rigorous 3D model for the modulation efficiency of silicon-on-insulator interleaved junction optical phase modulators with submicron dimensions. Solution of Drift-Diffusion and Poisson equations were carried out on 3D finite-element-mesh and Maxwell equations were solved using Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) method on 3D Yee-cells. Whole of the modelling process has been detailed and all the coefficients required in the model are presented. Model validation suggests &lt; 10% RMS error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of magnonic Fabry-P\'erot resonators as programmable phase shifters for spin-wave computing. The resonator, composed of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film coupled with a CoFeB nanostripe, operates through dynamic dipolar coupling, leading to wavelength downconversion and the formation of a magnonic cavity. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect (SNS-MOKE) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that these resonators can induce a $\pi$ phase shift in the transmitted spin wave. The phase shift is highly sensitive to the magnetization alignment within the resonator, allowing for on-demand control via magnetic switching. This feature, combined with low-loss transmission, positions the magnonic Fabry-P\'erot resonator as a promising component for reconfigurable magnonic circuits and spin-wave computing devices.</description>

      <title>Higly efficient, tunable, electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast and highly efficient dynamic optical metasurfaces enabling truly spatiotemporal control over optical radiation are poised to revolutionize modern optics and photonics, but their practical realization remains elusive. In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) operating in reflection that are amenable for ultrafast operation and thereby spatiotemporal control over reflected optical fields. The material configuration consists of a lithium niobate thin film sandwiched between an optically thick gold back-reflector and a grating of gold nanoridges also functioning as control electrodes. Metasurfaces for optical free-space intensity modulation are designed by utilizing the electro-optic Pockels effect in combination with an ultra-narrow qBIC resonance, whose wavelength can be finely tuned by varying the angle of light incidence. The fabricated electro-optic metasurfaces operate at telecom wavelengths with the modulation depth reaching 95 % (modulating thereby 35 % of the total incident power) for a bias voltage of +/-30 V within the electrical bandwidth of 125 MHz. Leveraging the highly angle-dependent qBIC resonance realized, we demonstrate electrically tunable phase contrast imaging using the fabricated metasurface. Moreover, given the potential bandwidth of 39 GHz estimated for the metasurface pixel size of 22 $\mu$m, the demonstrated electro-optic metasurfaces promise successful realization of unique optical functions, such as harmonic beam steering and spatiotemporal shaping as well as nonreciprocal operation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in the hydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical response of heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonance visibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become more distinct, allowing for detailed analysis of the underlying physics. With advanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and a tailored optimization algorithm, we obtain close agreement between simulations and experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhanced resonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that key parameters such as doping level and effective electron mass can be retrieved from a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account in the hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the optical response of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to become a standard modeling approach.</description>

Abstract: A 2D electromagnetic-thermal coupled numerical model has been developed using the finite element method and validated against experimental data to investigate a superconducting machine featuring high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape stacks and cryocooled iron cores. The HTS stacks are transformed into trapped field stacks (TFSs) through pulsed field magnetisation (PFM), generating rotor fields. After PFM, the superconducting motor operates on the same principle as permanent magnet synchronous motors. This study explores the behaviour of HTS stacks by altering the stack's layer number from one to nine and adjusting the pulsed current amplitude from 250 A to 1000 A. The primary objective of this paper is to identify the optimal combination of pulsed current amplitudes and TFS layer numbers for achieving maximum magnetisation fields. The secondary objective is to evaluate the overall losses in both superconducting and non-superconducting parts of the machine during magnetisation, including heat generated in various layers of the TFS, and losses in the motor's active materials (copper windings and iron cores). Two motor configurations were proposed, and two calculation methods using linear interpolation of iron losses and steel grades were introduced to estimate the iron losses for the studied iron material, M270-35A. This pioneering study is expected to serve as a valuable reference for loss analyses and structural design considerations in developing superconducting machines.</description>

      <title>Multi focus acoustic field generation using Dammann gratings for phased array transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phased array transducers can shape acoustic fields for versatile manipulation; however, generating multiple focal points typically involves complex optimization. This study demonstrates that Dammann gratings - binary phase gratings originally used in optics to generate equal-intensity spot arrays - can be adapted for acoustics to create multiple equal-strength focal points with a phased array transducer. The transducer elements were assigned phases of 0 or {\pi}, based on a Dammann grating defined by its transition points. Simulations show that simple gratings with two transition points can generate fields with up to 12 focal points of nearly equal acoustic pressures. Compared to conventional multi-focus phase optimization techniques, the Dammann grating approach offers computational efficiency and facile reconfiguration of the focal pattern by adjusting the grating hologram. We tested this approach in numerical simulations with a hypothetical high-resolution array, achieving up to 12 focal points, and validated the efficacy of the Dammann grating in a conventional 16x16 transducer array through both simulations and experiments. This comparison highlights that while Dammann gratings effectively generate multi-focus fields, the recreation ability of these gratings in a conventional array shows a lower resolution than the hypothetical array. This study underlines the potential of adapting binary phase functions from photonics to enhance ultrasound-based acoustic manipulation for tasks requiring parallel actuation at multiple points.</description>

      <title>Analysis on reservoir activation with the nonlinearity harnessed from solution-processed molybdenum disulfide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a recurrent neural network designed for approximating complex dynamics in, for instance, motion tracking, spatial-temporal pattern recognition, and chaotic attractor reconstruction. Its implementation demands intense computation for the nonlinear transformation of the reservoir input, i.e. activating the reservoir. Configuring physical nonlinear networks as the reservoir and employing the physical nonlinearity for the reservoir activation is an emergent solution to address the challenge. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of harnessing the nonlinearity from solution-processed molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for reservoir activation. We fit the high-order nonlinearity, achieved by Stark modulation of MoS2, as the activation function to facilitate implementation of a reservoir computing model. Due to the high-order nonlinearity, the model can achieve long-term synchronization and robust generalization for complex dynamical system regression. As a potential application exploring this ability, we appoint the model to generate chaotic random numbers for secure data encryption. Given this reservoir activation capability, and the scalability of solution-processed MoS2, our results suggest the potential for realizing physical reservoir computing with solution-processed MoS2.</description>

      <title>Spatial Quantization: Improving RRA Performance via Closely Spaced Elements Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the new perspective of spatial quantization, this article systematically studies the advantages of reconfigurable reflectarray (RRA) designed with closely spaced elements in terms of sidelobe level (SLL), scanning accuracy and scan loss, including theoretical analysis and simulation verification. This article sequentially studies RRAs with element periods of {\lambda}/2, {\lambda}/4 and {\lambda}/8. Both theoretical and simulation results show that under the condition of the same aperture size, with the number of spatial quantization bits increasing, the SLL performance of 1bit RRA using closely spaced structure will have a improvement of about 5dB. The scanning accuracy at 60{\deg} is improved from 54.52{\deg} at {\lambda}/2 to 57.97{\deg} at {\lambda}/8, while the scan loss is improved from 5.02dB at {\lambda}/2 to 2.85dB at {\lambda}/8. This study has an important reference value for reconfigurable reflectarray design, communication system and radar design.</description>

      <title>Flexible Thermoelectric Active Cooling Garment to Combat Extreme Heat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat events due to climate change, heat-related diseases or even mortality have become more prevalent. An efficient personal cooling strategy can mitigate heat stress by regulating the skin temperature within the thermal comfort zone. However, lightweight, wearable, and sustainable cooling garments are unavailable today. Here, we developed a TED-based cooling garment and demonstrated its effectiveness in active personal cooling. The garment is shown to maintain the skin temperature within its thermal comfort zone in a hot environment of up to 40 oC under mild forced convection conditions (air flow speed of 2.2 m s-1). Furthermore, we demonstrated a portable cooling system with less than 700 grams of total weight, which includes the TED-based garment, a battery pack, and a temperature controller. The system showed long-term cooling on the skin with varying ambient temperatures from 35 to 40 oC. With the advantages of lightweight, flexible, controllable and long-term effective cooling, the TED cooling garments described in this work can contribute to enhanced health and comfort in an increasingly hotter climate.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-driven Phononic Metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Phonons are quasi-particles associated with mechanical vibrations in materials, at the root of the propagation of sound, elastic / mechanical waves, and of thermal phenomena, common to our every day life and many technologies. The fundamental understanding and control over phonon responses in natural and artificial media is of major importance in the context of telecommunications, shielding, energy harvesting and control, sensing and imaging, across multiple scales. In this context, it has been recently realized that controlling different classes of symmetries at the microscopic and mesoscopic scale offers a powerful rational tool to precisely tailor phononic responses, leading to advanced acoustic and elastodynamic wave control. In this paper, we review the recent advances in the design and synthesis of artificial phononic media, namely phononic metamaterials, guided by symmetry principles. Starting from tailored broken spatial symmetries, we discuss their interplay with time symmetries for non-reciprocity and non-conservative phenomena, and finally address broader concepts that combine multiple symmetry classes to support exotic phononic wave transport.</description>

      <title>A frequency tunable low-noise YIG-GGG based oscillator with strong magneto-elastic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a frequency tunable magneto-acoustic oscillator (MAO) operating in low-phase-noise and complex dynamical regimes based on a single composite YIG-GGG resonator. The magneto-acoustic resonator (MAR) is based on a YIG (yttrium iron garnet) layer epitaxially grown on a GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) substrate. By optimizing the YIG thickness, we obtain a high magneto-elastic coupling of around 1 MHz between the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in YIG and high overtone acoustic resonances (HBARs) in the YIG-GGG structure in the 1-2 GHz frequency range. It allows to eliminate the need for pre-selectors and bulky circulators, thus simplifying the MAO design while maintaining the possibility to lock to HBAR YIG-GGG modes. With an adjustment in the loop over-amplification parameter, the MAO can be locked either only to high-Q magneto-acoustic HBARs or to both types of resonance including HBARs and the FMR mode of the YIG film. In a low-phase-noise regime, MAO generates only at certain values of the applied field and exhibits discrete frequency tunability with a 3.281 MHz step corresponding to the frequency separation between the adjacent HBAR modes in a YIG-GGG structure. In a complex regime where oscillation conditions expand to include both HBAR and FMR modes, MAO demonstrates continuous generation as the function of the applied field with variable phase noise parameters. Moreover, in low-phase-noise regime, MAO phase noise plot improves by 30 dB compared to the operational regime locked to the pure FMR in YIG which is in agreement with the measured FMR and HBAR Q-factors.</description>

Abstract: A two-terminal quantum spin-Hall heat engine and refrigerator with embedded Majorana bound states (MBS) is analyzed for optimality in thermoelectric performance using the Landaeur-Buttiker approach. This investigation can be an effective tool to detect MBS. Furthermore, the occurrence of MBS can enhance the performance to rival, as well as outperform, some modern nanoscale quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators. The optimal performance of this MBS quantum heat engine and quantum refrigerator can be further enhanced by an Aharonov-Bohm flux.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Inverse Design of Hyperuniform Optical Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse design of finite-size photonic materials with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs can capture the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inversely retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we numerically corroborate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. The flexible multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of more general effective media and finite-size optical metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the enhanced photonic spin Hall effect in a subwavelength grating supporting surface plasmon resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) structures has great potential for various polarization-sensitive applications and devices. Here, using optical weak measurement, we observe spin-dependent and spin-independent angular shifts of the reflected beam, enhanced by SPR in a subwavelength nickel grating. An enhanced in-plane photonic spin Hall effect manifested in the angular splitting of circularly polarized photons with opposite helicity signs is demonstrated. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that angular in-plane shifts can be changed from spin-independent (Goos-H\"anchen shift) to spin-dependent (PSHE) when the incident beam polarization state changes. The SPR-induced depolarization of light and the mixing of polarization states are detected. High purity of spin separation and a high degree of circular polarization are achieved with an optimal polarization state (preselection angle) and a resonance angle of incidence. The spineless spatial separation of two orthogonal components of the field with diagonal linear polarizations is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Ambient Drift and Negative-Bias Temperature Instability in Foundry Carbon Nanotube Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Back-end-of-line (BEOL) logic integration is emerging as a complementary scaling path to supplement front-end-of-line (FEOL) Silicon. Among various options for BEOL logic, Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) have been integrated within commercial silicon foundries, and complex CNFET circuits (e.g., RISC-V core, SRAM arrays) have been demonstrated. However, there lacks comprehensive studies that analyze the ambient drift (i.e., air-stability) and reliability of CNFETs. Here, for the first time, we thoroughly characterize and demonstrate how to overcome ambient drift and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in CNFETs using the following techniques: (1) Silicon Nitride encapsulation to limit ambient atmosphere induced threshold voltage shift (~8x reduction of median VT shift over 90 days) and (2) AC/pulsed operation to significantly improve CNFET NBTI vs. DC operation across a wide frequency range (e.g., 20% duty cycle AC operation at 10 MHz could extend CNFET NBTI time-to-failure by &gt;10000x vs. DC for a target VT shift tolerance &lt; 100 mV with gate stress bias VGS,stress = -1.2 V at 125 C).</description>

      <title>Emulating photonic time interfaces via smooth temporal transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of time as an additional degree of freedom to control wave-matter interactions have opened new avenues to fully control wave propagation in four dimensions (x,y,z,t). Time interfaces (rapid changes of the constitutive relations of the medium where a wave propagates) have recently become popular as they are the temporal analogue of spatial interfaces. While recent groundbreaking experimental work has demonstrated time interfaces from water waves, microwaves and the optical regime, rapidly changing, for instance, the permittivity of the medium requires carefully engineered structures. Here, we study the possibility of implementing smooth temporal transitions of the refractive index of the medium in order to mimic the response of time interfaces via adiabatic modulations. It is shown that indeed, as long as the signal is inside the structure during the modulation time, there are some values of rising/falling time of the adiabatic modulation that enables a full approximate emulation of a time interface. These results may open further avenues to explore by relaxing the speed at which the time-modulation should be introduced when designing four-dimensional media.</description>
