      <title>Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the benefits of integrating the novel clustered federated learning (CFL) approach with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets, where multiple devices participate in the aggregation with time limitations and a finite number of sub-channels. A detailed theoretical analysis of the generalization gap that measures the degree of non-IID in the data distribution is presented. Following that, solutions to address the challenges posed by non-IID conditions are proposed with the analysis of the properties. Specifically, users' data distributions are parameterized as concentration parameters and grouped using spectral clustering, with Dirichlet distribution serving as the prior. The investigation into the generalization gap and convergence rate guides the design of sub-channel assignments through the matching-based algorithm, and the power allocation is achieved by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the derived closed-form solution. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed cluster-based FL framework can outperform FL baselines in terms of both test accuracy and convergence rate. Moreover, jointly optimizing sub-channel and power allocation in NOMA-enhanced networks can lead to a significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Localization for In-body Nano-communication Medical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-machines circulating inside the human body, collecting data on tissue conditions, represent a vital part of next-generation medical diagnostic systems. However, for these devices to operate effectively, they need to relay not only their medical measurements but also their positions. This paper introduces a novel localization method for in-body nano-machines based on the magnetic field, leveraging the advantageous magnetic permeability of all human tissues. The entire proposed localization system is described, starting from 10x10 ${\mu}m^2$ magnetometers to be integrated into the nano-machines, to a set of external wires generating the magnetic field. Mathematical equations for the localization algorithm are also provided, assuming the nano-machines do not execute the computations themselves, but transmit their magnetic field measurements together with medical data outside of the body. The whole system is validated with computer simulations that capture the measurement error of the magnetometers, the error induced by the Earth magnetic field, and a human body model assuming different possible positions of nano-machines. The results show a very high system accuracy with localization errors even below 1 cm.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Spatio-Temporal State Estimation for Fine-grained Adaptive Anomaly Diagnosis of Industrial Cyber-physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection and diagnosis of abnormal behaviors such as network attacks from multivariate time series (MTS) are crucial for ensuring the stable and effective operation of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, existing researches pay little attention to the logical dependencies among system working states, and have difficulties in explaining the evolution mechanisms of abnormal signals. To reveal the spatio-temporal association relationships and evolution mechanisms of the working states of industrial CPS, this paper proposes a fine-grained adaptive anomaly diagnosis method (i.e. MAD-Transformer) to identify and diagnose anomalies in MTS. MAD-Transformer first constructs a temporal state matrix to characterize and estimate the change patterns of the system states in the temporal dimension. Then, to better locate the anomalies, a spatial state matrix is also constructed to capture the inter-sensor state correlation relationships within the system. Subsequently, based on these two types of state matrices, a three-branch structure of series-temporal-spatial attention module is designed to simultaneously capture the series, temporal, and space dependencies among MTS. Afterwards, three associated alignment loss functions and a reconstruction loss are constructed to jointly optimize the model. Finally, anomalies are determined and diagnosed by comparing the residual matrices with the original matrices. We conducted comparative experiments on five publicly datasets spanning three application domains (service monitoring, spatial and earth exploration, and water treatment), along with a petroleum refining simulation dataset collected by ourselves. The results demonstrate that MAD-Transformer can adaptively detect fine-grained anomalies with short duration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of noise robustness and localization performance.</description>

      <title>Over-The-Air Double-Threshold Deep Learner for Jamming Detection in 5G RF domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of 5G wireless communications, the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) plays a critical role in the synchronization of devices and accessibility of services. However, due to the predictable nature of SSB transmission, including the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), jamming attacks are critical threats. By leveraging RF domain knowledge, this work presents a novel deep learning-based technique for detecting jammers in 5G networks. Unlike the existing jamming detection algorithms that mostly rely on network parameters, we introduce a double threshold deep learning jamming detector by focusing on the SSB. The detection method is focused on RF domain features and improves the robustness of the network without requiring integration with the pre-existing network infrastructure. By integrating a preprocessing block that extracts PSS correlation and energy per null resource elements (EPNRE) characteristics, our method distinguishes between normal and jammed received signals with high precision. Additionally, by incorporation of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the efficacy of training and detection are optimized. A double threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) is also introduced to the architecture complemented by a deep cascade learning model to increase the sensitivity of the model to variations of signal to jamming noise ratio (SJNR). Results show that the proposed method achieves 96.4% detection rate in extra low jamming power, i.e., SJNR between 15 to 30 dB which outperforms the single threshold DNN design with 86.0% detection rate and unprocessed IQ sample DNN design with 83.2% detection rate. Ultimately, performance of DT-DDNN is validated through the analysis of real 5G signals obtained from a practical testbed, demonstrating a strong alignment with the simulation results.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning (ML) approach that enables multiple decentralized devices or edge servers to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging raw data. During the training and sharing of model updates between clients and servers, data and models are susceptible to different data-poisoning attacks.
  In this study, our motivation is to explore the severity of data poisoning attacks in the computer network domain because they are easy to implement but difficult to detect. We considered two types of data-poisoning attacks, label flipping (LF) and feature poisoning (FP), and applied them with a novel approach. In LF, we randomly flipped the labels of benign data and trained the model on the manipulated data. For FP, we randomly manipulated the highly contributing features determined using the Random Forest algorithm. The datasets used in this experiment were CIC and UNSW related to computer networks. We generated adversarial samples using the two attacks mentioned above, which were applied to a small percentage of datasets. Subsequently, we trained and tested the accuracy of the model on adversarial datasets. We recorded the results for both benign and manipulated datasets and observed significant differences between the accuracy of the models on different datasets. From the experimental results, it is evident that the LF attack failed, whereas the FP attack showed effective results, which proved its significance in fooling a server. With a 1% LF attack on the CIC, the accuracy was approximately 0.0428 and the ASR was 0.9564; hence, the attack is easily detectable, while with a 1% FP attack, the accuracy and ASR were both approximately 0.9600, hence, FP attacks are difficult to detect. We repeated the experiment with different poisoning percentages.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Label Flipping Attacks in Malicious URL Detectors Using Ensemble Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malicious URLs provide adversarial opportunities across various industries, including transportation, healthcare, energy, and banking which could be detrimental to business operations. Consequently, the detection of these URLs is of crucial importance; however, current Machine Learning (ML) models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks involve manipulating a small percentage of training data labels, such as Label Flipping (LF), which changes benign labels to malicious ones and vice versa. This manipulation results in misclassification and leads to incorrect model behavior. Therefore, integrating defense mechanisms into the architecture of ML models becomes an imperative consideration to fortify against potential attacks.
  The focus of this study is on backdoor attacks in the context of URL detection using ensemble trees. By illuminating the motivations behind such attacks, highlighting the roles of attackers, and emphasizing the critical importance of effective defense strategies, this paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to fortify ML models against adversarial threats within the ML domain in network security. We propose an innovative alarm system that detects the presence of poisoned labels and a defense mechanism designed to uncover the original class labels with the aim of mitigating backdoor attacks on ensemble tree classifiers. We conducted a case study using the Alexa and Phishing Site URL datasets and showed that LF attacks can be addressed using our proposed defense mechanism. Our experimental results prove that the LF attack achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) between 50-65% within 2-5%, and the innovative defense method successfully detected poisoned labels with an accuracy of up to 100%.</description>

      <title>Neural Codebook Design for Network Beam Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge for large antenna systems. Mobile systems like 5G use a beam management framework that joins the initial access, beamforming, CSI acquisition, and data transmission. The design of codebooks for these stages, however, is challenging due to their interrelationships, varying array sizes, and site-specific channel and user distributions. Furthermore, beam management is often focused on single-sector operations while ignoring the overarching network- and system-level optimization. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end learned codebook design algorithm, network beamspace learning (NBL), that captures and optimizes codebooks to mitigate interference while maximizing the achievable performance with extremely large hybrid arrays. The proposed algorithm requires limited shared information yet designs codebooks that outperform traditional codebooks by over 10dB in beam alignment and achieve more than 25% improvements in network spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learned Compression for Radio-Frequency Signal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation cellular concepts rely on the processing of large quantities of radio-frequency (RF) samples. This includes Radio Access Networks (RAN) connecting the cellular front-end based on software defined radios (SDRs) and a framework for the AI processing of spectrum-related data. The RF data collected by the dense RAN radio units and spectrum sensors may need to be jointly processed for intelligent decision making. Moving large amounts of data to AI agents may result in significant bandwidth and latency costs. We propose a deep learned compression (DLC) model, HQARF, based on learned vector quantization (VQ), to compress the complex-valued samples of RF signals comprised of 6 modulation classes. We are assessing the effects of HQARF on the performance of an AI model trained to infer the modulation class of the RF signal. Compression of narrow-band RF samples for the training and off-the-site inference will allow for an efficient use of the bandwidth and storage for non-real-time analytics, and for a decreased delay in real-time applications. While exploring the effectiveness of the HQARF signal reconstructions in modulation classification tasks, we highlight the DLC optimization space and some open problems related to the training of the VQ embedded in HQARF.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Exploratory Learning-Aided Community Detection Under Topological Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social networks, the discovery of community structures has received considerable attention as a fundamental problem in various network analysis tasks. However, due to privacy concerns or access restrictions, the network structure is often uncertain, thereby rendering established community detection approaches ineffective without costly network topology acquisition. To tackle this challenge, we present META-CODE, a unified framework for detecting overlapping communities via exploratory learning aided by easy-to-collect node metadata when networks are topologically unknown (or only partially known). Specifically, META-CODE consists of three iterative steps in addition to the initial network inference step: 1) node-level community-affiliation embeddings based on graph neural networks (GNNs) trained by our new reconstruction loss, 2) network exploration via community-affiliation-based node queries, and 3) network inference using an edge connectivity-based Siamese neural network model from the explored network. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets including two large networks, we demonstrated: (a) the superiority of META-CODE over benchmark community detection methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 151.27% compared to the best existing competitor, (b) the impact of each module in META-CODE, (c) the effectiveness of node queries in META-CODE based on empirical evaluations and theoretical findings, (d) the convergence of the inferred network, and (e) the computational efficiency of META-CODE.</description>

      <title>Swing: Short-cutting Rings for Higher Bandwidth Allreduce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The allreduce collective operation accounts for a significant fraction of the runtime of workloads running on distributed systems. One factor determining its performance is the distance between communicating nodes, especially on networks like torus, where a higher distance implies multiple messages being forwarded on the same link, thus reducing the allreduce bandwidth. Torus networks are widely used on systems optimized for machine learning workloads (e.g., Google TPUs and Amazon Trainium devices), as well as on some of the Top500 supercomputers. To improve allreduce performance on torus networks we introduce Swing, a new algorithm that keeps a low distance between communicating nodes by swinging between torus directions. Our analysis and experimental evaluation show that Swing outperforms by up to 3x existing allreduce algorithms for vectors ranging from 32B to 128MiB, on different types of torus and torus-like topologies, regardless of their shape and size.</description>
