      <title>Late-Time Evolution of Magnetized Disks in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classic time-dependent 1D accretion disk models, the inner radiation pressure dominated regime is viscously unstable. However, late-time observations of accretion disks formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs) do not exhibit evidence of such instabilities. The common theoretical response is to modify the viscosity parametrization, but typically used viscosity parametrization are generally ad hoc. In this study, we take a different approach, and investigate a time-dependent 1D $\alpha$-disk model in which the pressure is dominated by magnetic fields rather than photons. We compare the time evolution of thermally stable, strongly magnetized TDE disks to the simpler linear viscosity model. We find that the light curves of magnetized disks evolve as $L_{\rm UV}\propto t^{-5/6}$ for decades to centuries, and that this same evolution can be reproduced by the linear viscosity model for specific parameter choices. Additionally, we show that TDEs remain UV-bright for many years, suggesting we could possibly find fossil TDEs decades after their bursts. We estimate that ULTRASAT could detect hundreds of such events, providing an opportunity to study late-stage TDE physics and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties. Finally, we explore the connection between TDE disks and quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) suggested by recent observations. One theoretical explanation involves TDE disks expanding to interact with extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which produce X-ray flares as the EMRI passes through the disk. Our estimates indicate that magnetized TDE disks should exhibit QPEs earlier than those observed in AT2019qiz, suggesting that the QPEs may have begun before their first detection.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <title>Leaking Outside the Box: Kinetic Turbulence with Cosmic-Ray Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particle acceleration in strongly turbulent pair plasmas using novel 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations, featuring particle injection from an external heat bath and diffusive escape. We demonstrate the formation of steady-state, nonthermal particle distributions with maximum energies reaching the Hillas limit. The steady state is characterized by the equilibration of plasma kinetic and magnetic pressures, which imposes upper limits on the acceleration rate. With growing cold plasma magnetization $\sigma_0$, nonthermal power-law spectra become harder, and the fraction of energy channeled into escaping cosmic rays increases. At $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, the escaping cosmic rays amount to more than 50\% of the dissipated energy. Our method allows for kinetic studies of particle acceleration under steady-state conditions, with applications to a variety of astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Neutrino quantum kinetics in three flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of neutrino flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism is yet to be fully understood. We present multi-energy and multi-angle solutions of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations in three flavors, taking into account neutrino advection and non-forward collisions with the background medium. Flavor evolution is explored within a spherically symmetric shell surrounding the region of neutrino decoupling in the interior of a core-collapse supernova, relying on the outputs of a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$. We select two representative post-bounce times: $t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s (no angular crossings are present and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective effects) and $t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s (angular crossings trigger fast flavor instabilities). We find that flavor equipartition is achieved in the antineutrino sector between $\bar\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_x = (\bar\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\tau)/2$ for both post-bounce times. In the neutrino sector, flavor equipartition between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_x$ seems more likely at later post-bounce times, where the neutrino emission properties among different flavors tend to approach each other, but it is not a generic feature. The exponential growth of the $\nu_\mu$--$\nu_\tau$ asymmetry due to three-flavor effects is responsible for differences between the quasi-steady configurations obtained in the three-flavor solution and in the two-flavor approximation. This has consequences on the neutrino heating rate, which is generally larger when all three flavors are taken into account and can increase up to $30\%$ with respect to the case where flavor conversion is neglected.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abfo: a partially stripped SN II from a white supergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic data of the type IIb supernova (SN) 2024abfo in NGC 1493 (at 11 Mpc). The ATLAS survey discovered the object just a few hours after the explosion, and observed a fast rise on the first day. Signs of the sharp shock break-out peak and the subsequent cooling phase are observed in the ultraviolet and the bluest optical bands in the first couple of days, while no peak is visible in the reddest filters. Subsequently, in analogy with normal SNe IIb, the light curve of SN 2024abfo rises again in all bands to the broad peak, with the maximum light reached around one month after the explosion. Its absolute magnitude at peak is $M_r=-16.5\pm0.1$ mag, making it a faint SN IIb. The early spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with broad P-Cygni profiles indicating ejecta velocity of 22,500 \kms. One month after the explosion, the spectra display a transition towards being He-dominated, though the H lines do not completely disappear, supporting the classification of SN 2024abfo as a relatively H-rich SN IIb. We identify the progenitor of SN 2024abfo in archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Dark Energy Survey, and the XMM-Newton space telescope, in multiple optical filters. From its spectral energy distribution, the progenitor is consistent with being a white supergiant, Deneb-like star, with a photospheric temperature of 8110 K, a radius of 176 \Rsun, a luminosity of $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.08$, having an initial mass of 15-16 \Msun. This detection supports an emerging trend of SN IIb progenitors being more luminous and hotter than SN II ones, and being primaries of massive binaries. Within the SN IIb class, fainter events such as SN 2024abfo tend to have cooler and more expanded progenitors than luminous SNe IIb.</description>

      <title>Precise constraint on properties of neutron stars through new universal relations and astronomical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the great uncertainty of the equation of state (EOS) of high-density nuclear matter, establishing EOS-independent universal relations between global properties of neutron stars provides a practical way to constrain the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties through astronomical observations. It is common to construct universal relations between EOS-dependent properties (e.g., moment of inertia, tidal deformation, etc.) or combined properties (e.g., compactness). Improving the precision of the universal relations may provide stricter constraint on the properties of neutron star. We find that in 3-dimensional space with mass and radius as the base coordinates, the points corresponding to a certain property of neutron star described by different EOSs are almost located in the same surface. Thus the universal relation between the property and the stellar mass-radius can be expressed through describing the surface.
  It is shown that the resulting universal relations have higher precisions. As an example, we construct high-precision universal relations for the moment of inertia, the $f$-mode frequency, and the dimensionless tidal deformation respect to the mass-radius. As the observational data of neutron star mass and radius from NICER grows in data and accuracy, these universal relations allow for more precise constraints on the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties.</description>

      <title>4XMM J181330.1-175110: a new supergiant fast X-ray transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXT) are a sub-class of High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXB) in which a compact object accretes part of the clumpy wind of the blue supergiant companion, triggering a series of brief, X-ray flares lasting a few kiloseconds. Currently, only about fifteen SFXTs are known. The EXTraS catalog provides the timing signatures of every source observed by the EPIC instrument on-board XMM-Newton. Among the most peculiar sources, in terms of variability, we selected 4XMM J181330.1-17511 (J1813). We analyzed all publicly available X-ray data pointed at the J1813 position to determine the source's duty cycle and to provide a comprehensive description of its timing and spectral behavior during its active phase. Additionally, we searched for the optical and infrared counterpart of the X-ray source in public databases and fitted its Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). The optical-to-MIR SED of J1813 is consistent with a highly-absorbed (A$_V\sim38$) B0 star at $\sim$10 kpc. During its X-ray active phase, the source is characterized by continuous $\sim$thousands seconds-long flares with peak luminosities (2-12 keV) ranging from $10^{34}$ to $4 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Its X-ray spectrum is consistent with a high-absorbed power-law model with N$_H \sim 1.8 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma \sim 1.66$. No spectral variability was observed as a function of time or flux. J1813 is in a quiescent state $\sim$60\% of the time, with an upper-limit luminosity of $8 \times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 10 kpc), implying an observed long-term X-ray flux variability $&gt;$500. The optical counterpart alone indicates J1813 is a HMXB. Its transient nature, duty cycle, the amplitude of observed X-ray variability, the shape and luminosity of the X-ray flares -- and the lack of known X-ray outbursts ($&gt;10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$) -- strongly support the identification of J1813 as an SFXT.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic oscillations of GHz-band polarization in a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from accreting black holes (BHs) radiate non-thermal emission which is highly variable in different time scales. Magnetic fields anchored to a rotating BH or accretion disc accelerate and collimate jets of the BH systems. Previous studies on black holes of different mass scales, including supermassive and stellar-mass black holes, only report flux quasi-periodic oscillations in radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. No quasi-periodic variations in polarization have yet been detected in any black hole systems. Here, we report the first detection of GHz radio polarization oscillations in GRS 1915+105, which harbors a spinning stellar-mass BH with a relativistic jet. Our observations show that during the increasing phase of radio emission, linear polarization and flux exhibit similar oscillation periods of $\sim 17$ and $33$ seconds, and their variation patterns anti-correlate with each other. These rare, short-period oscillations in both polarization and flux would be important to understand instabilities and special dynamics in magnetized jets.</description>

      <title>Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Active Galactic Nucleus Disks: The Role of Circumsingle Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we numerically explore the dynamics of a point mass (e.g., a stellar-mass black hole) moving within a thin accretion disk of a massive object (i.e., a supermassive black hole) with three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using \texttt{Athena++}. We are particularly interested in the regime that the Hill radius of the point mass is greater than the disk thickness, but the point mass is not sufficiently massive to open a ``gap" in a high viscosity disk. This parameter regime may be seen for stellar-mass objects moving within thin accretion disks of massive black holes, but less studied for the planet migration scenario in protoplanetary disks. We find that the disk migration may be significantly slower than the type I migration, depending on the surface density gradient of the disk. Furthermore, the circumsingle disk around the point mass plays an important role in damping the orbital eccentricity. If the gravitational interaction between the point mass and circumsingle disk material is turned off, the orbital eccentricity may be pumped to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ level. Because space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is able to measure the eccentricity of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, this finding highlights the importance of understanding stellar-mass black hole feedback mechanisms which will modify the structures of the circumsingle disk, as they will impact LISA observables such as the eccentricity.</description>

      <title>A possible jet and corona configuration for Swift J1727.8--1613 during the hard state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swift J1727.8--1613 is a black hole X-ray binary that differs from other black hole X-ray binaries in that it has an extra hard component in addition to a reflection component. We perform spectral analysis with simultaneous Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR observations when the source was in the hard and hard intermediate states. For the presentation of the extra components, we investigate the correlation between the relxill parameters. We find that the correlation between the spectral index and the reflection fraction is consistent with MAXI J1820+070 when the jet dominates the reflection. This provides the second sample to have such a correlation during an outburst. Interestingly, when the reflection component is attributed to the corona, the spectral fit results in a small reflection fraction and the correlation between the spectral index and reflection fraction is in agreement with the overall trend built-in You et al. 2023 with a large sample of outbursts from other X-ray binaries. Hence Swift J1727.8--1613 turns out to be the first sample to bridge the MAXI J1820+070 to the majority of X-ray binaries according to the dual correlations observed between the spectral index and the reflection fraction. We speculate that a configuration of a jet plus a hot inner flow may account for this peculiar outburst behavior of Swift J1727.8--1613.</description>

      <title>EP240801a/XRF 240801B: An X-ray Flash Detected by the Einstein Probe and Implications of its Multiband Afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multiband observations and analysis of EP240801a, a low-energy, extremely soft gamma-ray burst (GRB) discovered on August 1, 2024 by the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, with a weak contemporaneous signal also detected by Fermi/GBM. Optical spectroscopy of the afterglow, obtained by GTC and Keck, identified the redshift of $z = 1.6734$. EP240801a exhibits a burst duration of 148 s in X-rays and 22.3 s in gamma-rays, with X-rays leading by 80.61 s. Spectral lag analysis indicates the gamma-ray signal arrived 8.3 s earlier than the X-rays. Joint spectral fitting of EP/WXT and Fermi/GBM data yields an isotropic energy $E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}} = (5.57^{+0.54}_{-0.50})\times 10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$, a peak energy $E_{\rm{peak}} = 14.90^{+7.08}_{-4.71}\,\rm{keV}$, a fluence ratio $\rm S(25-50\,\rm{keV})/S(50-100\,\rm{keV}) = 1.67^{+0.74}_{-0.46}$, classifying EP240801a as an X-ray flash (XRF). The host-galaxy continuum spectrum, inferred using Prospector, was used to correct its contribution for the observed outburst optical data. Unusual early $R$-band behavior and EP/FXT observations suggest multiple components in the afterglow. Three models are considered: two-component jet model, forward-reverse shock model and forward-shock model with energy injection. Both three provide reasonable explanations. The two-component jet model and the energy injection model imply a relatively small initial energy and velocity of the jet in the line of sight, while the forward-reverse shock model remains typical. Under the two-component jet model, EP240801a may resemble GRB 221009A (BOAT) if the bright narrow beam is viewed on-axis. Therefore, EP240801a can be interpreted as an off-beam (narrow) jet or an intrinsically weak GRB jet. Our findings provide crucial clues for uncovering the origin of XRFs.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin on the dynamics of multi-component trans-relativistic accretion flows around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the axially symmetric accretion of low angular momentum hydrodynamic matter onto a rotating black hole. The gravitational field under consideration is assumed to be described by a pseudo-Newtonian Kerr potential. The accreting matter consists of different species defined by a relativistic equation of state with a variable adiabatic index.We construct and solve the hydrodynamical conservation equations governing such a flow, and find out the corresponding stationary integral solutions. We find that depending on the values of initial boundary conditions, accretion flow may exhibit multi-transonic behaviour, and a standing shock may form. We investigate, in minute detail, how the spin angular momentum of the black hole, as well as the composition of the accreting matter influence the dynamics of accretion flow and the astrophysics of shock formation in the aforementioned accreting black hole systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are the most magnetic objects in the Universe, serving as unique laboratories to test physics under extreme magnetic conditions that cannot be replicated on Earth. They were discovered in the late 1970s through their powerful X-ray flares, and were subsequently identified as neutron stars characterized by steady and transient emission across the radio, infrared, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. In this chapter, we summarize the current state of our experimental and theoretical knowledge on magnetars, as well as briefly discussing their relationship with supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, and the transient multi-band sky at large.</description>

      <title>Can we disentangle between the emission of an accretion disc around a single black hole and a circumbinary disc ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from binary black holes (BBHs) started the hunt for their pre-merger electromagnetic emission. In that respect, numerical simulations have been looking for the "smoking gun" signal that could help identify pre-merger systems. Here we study if any of the expected features of circumbinary discs, such as the periodic modulation from the orbiting "lump", could be used to identify pre-merger BBHs or if they could be easily confused with other systems. Indeed, while the timing feature associated with the "lump" seems to be present for a large part of the parameter space defined by the binary separation and mass ratio in circular binaries, it was recently proposed to form thanks to an instability occurring naturally at the edge of accretion discs around single black holes (SBH). In order to check if features of a circumbinary disc could be reproduced by a SBH system, we search for at least one SBH fit able to replicate the given synthetic observations of a circumbinary disc. We found that many of the features from a circumbinary disc can be reproduced by a SBH system with different masses, distances or inner disc positions. Interestingly, while we can always find a SBH model providing a good enough fit to the data, the presence of two variabilities, associated with the lump and the binary, or binary-lump beat, period, is a necessary condition for a wide range of BBH system parameters and should be used as a test to disqualify some BBH candidates.</description>

      <title>Introducing APERTURE: A GPU-based General Relativistic Particle-in-Cell Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be surrounded by a collisionless, highly magnetized accretion flow. As a result, Particle-in-Cell simulations are the best tools to study the immediate vicinity of the event horizons of these supermassive black holes. We present a GPU-based general relativistic particle-in-cell (GRPIC) code framework called Aperture. Aperture is developed in C++, with compute kernels written in CUDA and HIP to take advantage of the massive acceleration modern GPUs enable. The code is organized in a fully modular way, allowing easy extensions to new physics problems. In this paper, we describe in detail the particle pusher, field solver, and charge-conserving current deposition algorithms employed in Aperture, and present test cases to validate their correctness. Then, we apply the code to study spark gaps and plasma injection in black hole magnetospheres. We find that the apparent location and time-evolution of the gap depend on the observer. Our results reconcile the previous conflicting findings from 1D and 2D simulations in the literature.</description>

      <title>Searching for Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight Dark Matter (ULDM) offers an alternative to cold dark matter, characterized by wavelike behavior on galactic scales. This contribution summarizes our work~\cite{Blas:2024duy} on how solitonic cores induced by ULDM affect gravitational waves (GWs), enabling their detection through next-generation observatories like LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We show that continuous GWs from spinning neutron stars near the Galactic Center (GC) can probe solitons for \(m \lesssim 10^{-22}\, \mathrm{eV}\) and surpass current constraints on the ULDM couplings to the Standard Model for masses \(m \lesssim 10^{-20}\, \mathrm{eV}\). Additionally, GW modulation could reveal solitons in extragalactic systems, particularly in more massive halos, highlighting the broad potential of GW-based methods for uncovering ULDM properties.</description>

      <title>Impact of multi-messenger spectral modelling on blazar-neutrino associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are interesting source candidates for astrophysical neutrino emission. Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon (p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra which are typically strongly peaked at high energies. In contrast, statistical analyses looking to associate blazars and neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral shape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of such spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with blazars. We use hierarchical_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source searches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra through a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our spectral model is based on the predictions presented in Rodrigues et al. (2024) for a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have been connected with IceCube neutrino alert events. We apply our model to the 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, focusing on the Northern hemisphere. Out of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that have an association probability greater than 0.5 to at least one event. The p-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events compared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations to high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information from theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino connections.</description>

      <title>Inferring kilonova ejecta photospheric properties from early blackbody spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simple analytic corrections to the standard blackbody fitting used for early kilonova emission. We consider a spherical, relativistically expanding shell that radiates thermally at a single temperature in its own rest frame. Due to relativistic effects, including Doppler boosting, time delay, and temperature evolution -- the observed temperature is smeared across different polar angles by approximately $\sim10\%$. While the observed spectrum remains roughly consistent with a single-temperature blackbody, neglecting relativistic effects leads to significant systematic inaccuracies: the inferred photospheric velocity and temperature are overestimated by up to $\sim50\%$ for mildly relativistic velocities. By applying our analytic corrections, these deviations are reduced to within $10\%$, even in cases where the photosphere is receding and cooling is considered. Applying our corrections to observed kilonovae (AT2017gfo and the thermal component of GRB211211A) reveals that standard blackbody fitting overestimated the inferred velocities and temperatures by $10\%-40\%$.</description>

      <title>On the progenitor of the type Ia supernova remnant 0509-67.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the iron and hydrogen similar elliptical morphologies of the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5, I suggest that the ambient gas shaped the SN ejecta, that it is a remnant of an old planetary nebula, and that the explosion was more or less spherical. Adding that there is no observed stellar survivor in this SNR, I conclude that the SN Ia scenarios that best account for the explosion of this SN inside a planetary nebula (SNIP), are the lonely white dwarf scenarios, i.e., the core-degenerate (CD) and the double degenerate (DD) with merger to explosion delay (MED) time, i.e., the DD-MED scenario. Other scenarios encounter challenges, but I cannot completely rule them out. If true, the suggestion of SNR~0509-67.5 being a SNIP implies that the fraction of SNIPs might be higher than the previously estimated 50 percent of all normal SNe Ia. In the frame of the CD and the DD-MED scenarios, I attribute the observed double-shell structure in calcium to Rayleigh-Taylor instability during the explosion process: the caps of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability mushrooms form the outer shell. Instabilities during the explosion process might form clumps of some elements moving much faster than their mean velocity, possibly explaining fast-moving intermediate-mass elements.</description>

      <title>An active repeating fast radio burst in a magnetized eruption environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts with unidentified extra-galactic origin. Some FRBs exhibit mild magneto-ionic environmental variations, possibly attributed to plasma turbulence or geometric configuration variation in a binary system. Here we report an abrupt magneto-ionic environment variation of FRB 20220529, a repeating FRB from a disk galaxy at redshift 0.1839. Initially, its Faraday rotation measure (RM) was $21 \pm 96~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ over 17 months. In December 2023, it jumped to $1976.9~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, exceeding twenty times of the standard deviation of the previous RM variation, and returned to the typical values within two weeks. Such a drastic RM variation suggests a dense magnetized clump moving across the line of sight, possibly due to coronal mass ejection associated with a stellar flare. It indicates that the FRB likely has a companion star that produced the stellar flare.</description>

      <title>DeepGrav: Anomalous Gravitational-Wave Detection Through Deep Latent Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel deep learning-based approach for gravitational wave anomaly detection, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional matched filtering techniques in identifying unknown waveform gravitational wave signals. We introduce a modified convolutional neural network architecture inspired by ResNet that leverages residual blocks to extract high-dimensional features, effectively capturing subtle differences between background noise and gravitational wave signals. This network architecture learns a high-dimensional projection while preserving discrepancies with the original input, facilitating precise identification of gravitational wave signals. In our experiments, we implement an innovative data augmentation strategy that generates new data by computing the arithmetic mean of multiple signal samples while retaining the key features of the original signals.
  In the NSF HDR A3D3: Detecting Anomalous Gravitational Wave Signals competition, it is honorable for us (group name: easonyan123) to get to the first place at the end with our model achieving a true negative rate (TNR) of 0.9708 during development/validation phase and 0.9832 on an unseen challenge dataset during final/testing phase, the highest among all competitors. These results demonstrate that our method not only achieves excellent generalization performance but also maintains robust adaptability in addressing the complex uncertainties inherent in gravitational wave anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Great Balls of FIRE IV. The contribution of massive star clusters to the astrophysical population of merging binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of over a hundred gravitational wave signals from double compacts objects have confirmed the existence of such binaries with tight orbits. Two main formation channels are generally considered to explain the formation of these merging binary black holes (BBHs): the isolated evolution of stellar binaries, and the dynamical assembly in dense environments, namely star clusters. Although their relative contributions remain unclear, several analyses indicate that the detected BBH mergers probably originate from a mixture of these two distinct scenarios. We study the formation of massive star clusters across time and at a cosmological scale to estimate the contribution of these dense stellar structures to the overall population of BBH mergers. To this end, we propose three different models of massive star cluster formation based on results obtained with zoom-in simulations of individual galaxies. We apply these models to a large sample of realistic galaxies identified in the $(22.1\ \mathrm{Mpc})^3$ cosmological volume simulation \firebox. Each galaxy in this simulation has a unique star formation rate, with its own history of halo mergers and metallicity evolution. Combined with predictions obtained with the Cluster Monte Carlo code for stellar dynamics, we are able to estimate populations of dynamically formed BBHs in a collection of realistic galaxies. Across our three models, we infer a local merger rate of BBHs formed in massive star clusters consistently in the range $1-10\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Compared with the local BBH merger rate inferred by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (in the range $17.9-44\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z=0.2$), this could potentially represent up to half of all BBH mergers in the nearby Universe. This shows the importance of this formation channel in the astrophysical production of merging BBHs.</description>

      <title>Bounds on neutrino-DM interactions from TXS 0506+056 neutrino outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the neutrino-dark matter cross-section using the $13 \pm 5$ neutrino event excess observed by IceCube in 2014-2015 from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056. Our analysis takes advantage of the dark matter overdensity spike surrounding the supermassive black hole at the center of the blazar. In our results, we take into account uncertainties related to the different types of neutrino emission models and the features of the dark matter spike, considering cross-sections that scale with energy as $\sigma \propto (E_{\nu} /E_0)^n$, for values of $n = 1, 0, -1, -2$. In our best-case scenario, we obtain limits competitive with those derived from other active galaxies, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and the IC-170922A event.</description>

      <title>Image Data Augmentation for the TAIGA-IACT Experiment with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) generate a huge amount of data that must be classified automatically, ideally in real time. Currently, machine learning-based solutions are increasingly being used to solve classification problems. However, these classifiers require proper training data sets to work correctly. The problem with training neural networks on real IACT data is that these data need to be pre-labeled, whereas such labeling is difficult and its results are estimates. In addition, the distribution of incoming events is highly imbalanced. Firstly, there is an imbalance in the types of events, since the number of detected gamma quanta is significantly less than the number of protons. Secondly, the energy distribution of particles of the same type is also imbalanced, since high-energy particles are extremely rare. This imbalance results in poorly trained classifiers that, once trained, do not handle rare events correctly. Using only conventional Monte Carlo event simulation methods to solve this problem is possible, but extremely resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose to perform data augmentation with artificially generated events of the desired type and energy using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), distinguishing classes by energy values. In the paper, we describe a simple algorithm for generating balanced data sets using cGANs. Thus, the proposed neural network model produces both imbalanced data sets for physical analysis as well as balanced data sets suitable for training other neural networks.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates polarimetric characteristics of the blazar 3C~454.3 at 22-129~GHz using decadal~(2011-2022) data sets. In addition, we also delve into the origin of the polarization flare observed in 2019. The data sets were obtained from the single-dish mode observations of the Korean VLBI Network~(KVN) and the 43-GHz Very Long Baseline Array~(VLBA). We compared the consistency of the measurements between milli-arcsecond and arcsecond scales. The Faraday rotation measure values were obtained via two approaches, model fitting to a linear function in all frequency ranges, and calculation from adjacent frequency pairs. We found that the linear polarization angle is preferred to be $\sim100^{\circ}$ when the source is highly polarized. At 43~GHz, we found that the polarized emission at scales of mas and arcsecond is consistent when we compare its flux density and polarization angle. The ratio of quasi-simultaneously measured polarized flux density is $1.02\pm0.07$, and the polarization angles display similar rotation. These suggest that the extended jet beyond the scale of VLBA 43~GHz has a negligible convolution effect on the polarization angle from the KVN. We found an interesting, notable flaring event in the KVN single-dish data from the polarized emission in 2019 in the frequency range of 22-129~GHz. During the flare, the observed polarization angles~($\chi_{\rm obs}$) rotate from $\sim150^{\circ}$ to $\sim100^{\circ}$ at all frequencies with a chromatic polarization degree~($m_{\rm p}$). Based on the observed $m_{\rm p}$ and $\chi_{\rm obs}$, and also the Faraday rotation measure, we suggest that the polarization flare in 2019 is attributed to the shock-shock interaction in the stationary jet region. The change in the viewing angle of the jet alone is insufficient to describe the increase in brightness temperature, indicating the presence of source intrinsic processes.</description>

      <title>Significant challenges for astrophysical inference with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of gravitational-wave observatories will achieve unprecedented strain sensitivities with an expanded observing band. They will detect ${\cal O}(10^5)$ binary neutron star (BNS) mergers every year, the loudest of which will be in the band for $\approx 90$ minutes with signal-to-noise ratios $\approx 1500$. Current techniques will not be able to determine the astrophysical parameters of the loudest of next-gen BNS signals. We show that subtleties arising from the rotation of the Earth and the free-spectral range of gravitational-wave interferometers dramatically increases the complexity of next-gen BNS signals compared to the one-minute signals seen by LIGO--Virgo. Various compression methods currently relied upon to speed up the most expensive BNS calculations -- reduced-order quadrature, multi-banding, and relative binning -- will no longer be effective. We carry out reduced-order inference on a simulated next-gen BNS signal taking into account the Earth's rotation and the observatories' free-spectral range. We show that standard data compression techniques become impractical, and the full problem becomes computationally infeasible, when we include data below $\approx 16$Hz -- a part of the observing band that is critical for precise sky localisation. We discuss potential paths towards solving this complex problem.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Photon Tridents Through Primordial Black Hole Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gamma-ray signals from primordial black holes (PBHs) could provide compelling evidence for their role as a dark matter candidate, particularly through the observation of their Hawking radiation. Future gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM, and the next-generation telescopes, are poised to explore this possibility by measuring both Standard Model (SM) and beyond-the-SM particle emissions. A particularly promising avenue involves production of dark photons by PBHs, which is a hypothetical particle that decays into photons. In this work, we investigate the trident decay of dark photons focusing on their primary emission from PBHs. We assume that the dark photons produced via Hawking radiation decay into photons well before reaching Earth, thereby enhancing the detectable gamma-ray flux. The energy spectrum of the photons decaying from the dark photons is distinct from that of direct Hawking-radiated photons due to higher degree of freedom, leading to observable modifications in the gamma-ray signal. Using the asteroid-mass PBHs as a case study, we demonstrate that future gamma-ray missions could detect dark-photon signatures and distinguish them from conventional Hawking radiation. This approach enables the exploration of previously inaccessible parameter spaces in dark photon mass $m_{A^{\prime}}$ and their coupling to photons, offering a novel pathway to uncover the properties of dark sectors and the nature of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion in the Schwarzschild spacetime in the Newtonian analogous construct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The velocity-dependent Newtonian analogous potentials (NAPs) corresponding to general relativistic (GR) spacetimes accurately capture most of the relativistic features, including all classical tests of GR, effectively representing spacetime geometries in Newtonian terms. The NAP formulated by Tejeda \&amp; Rosswog (TR13) for Schwarzschild spacetime has been applied to the standard thin accretion disk around a black hole (BH) as well as in the context of streamlines of noninteracting particles accreting onto a Schwarzschild BH, showing good agreement with the exact relativistic solutions. As a further application, here we explore the extent to which TR13 NAP could describe a transonic hydrodynamical spherical accretion flow in Schwarzschild spacetime within the framework of standard Newtonian hydrodynamics. Instead of obtaining a typical single "saddle-type" sonic transition, a "saddle-spiral pair" is produced, with the inner sonic point being an (unphysical) "spiral type" and the outer being a usual "saddle type." The Bondi accretion rate at outer sonic radii, however, remains consistent with that of the GR case. The primary reason for the deviation of our findings from the classical Bondi solution is likely due to the inconsistency between the Euler-type equation in the presence of velocity-dependent TR13 NAP within the standard Newtonian hydrodynamics framework, and the corresponding GR Euler equation, regardless of the fluid's energy. Our study suggests that a (modified) hydrodynamical formalism is needed to effectively implement such potentials in transonic accretion studies that align with the spirit of TR13-like NAP, while remaining consistent with the GR hydrodynamics. This could then essentially circumvent GR hydrodynamics or GR magnetohydrodynamics equations.</description>

      <title>Tidal response of regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal deformability of regular black holes (RBHs). Employing different phenomenological models, we analyze their response to both test fields and gravitational perturbations, interpreting the latter within the framework of Einstein's field equations in the presence of an appropriate exotic matter distribution. Numerical and analytical methods reveal that RBHs exhibit non-trivial tidal responses, influenced by their regularization parameters and exotic matter distributions. The results obtained for test fields and gravitational perturbations are in qualitative agreement. This hints at the possibility that similar conclusions could hold if these spacetimes were interpreted as solutions of a modified gravitational action. Our findings suggest that RBHs possess distinct, though subtle, tidal signatures, which may serve as observational probes of their internal structure in gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: a multi-dimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1-D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3-D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1-D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability of running HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3-D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future development is to extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>Super heavy dark matter origin of the PeV neutrino event: KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT experiment offers a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we explore a simplest possibility that this event originates from the decay of a super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). We consider a minimal extension of the type-I seesaw by including a singlet scalar and a singlet fermion DM, both being odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry. At high scale, the $Z_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vev of the $Z_2$ odd scalar, leading to i) mixing between DM and heavy right-handed neutrinos and ii) formation of domain walls (DW). In the former case, the decay of the DM to $\nu,h$ can give rise to the PeV neutrino event KM3-230213A. While, in the latter case, the disappearance of the DW can give rise to stochastic gravitational waves. We derive constraints on the DM lifetime as a function of DM mass ensuring consistency with IceCube, Auger upper limits and the observed KM3-230213A event. We found that KM3-230213A gives stringent constraint on DM mass ranging from $1.7\times10^8$ GeV to $5.5\times10^9$ GeV with lifetime $6.3\times10^{29}$ s to $3.6\times10^{29}$ s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We made use high-cadence observations from the $Insight$-HXMT and $NICER$ to scrutinize the spectral and timing evolution during the 2018 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1820+070. It's hardness-intensity diagram (HID) displays a ``q''-like track including all the spectral states, along a unique loop in the hard state. The tracks observed in the HID is anticipated in the evolution of the components responsible for Compton and reflection emission. This is substantiated by the relationship between the X-ray luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}$ and photon index $\Gamma$ which exhibits a pattern reminiscent of HID. The distinctive evolution of the reflection component leads to the unique loop in the HID (also in the $L_\mathrm{X}$--$\Gamma$ plane) of hard state. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between frequency of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) ($\nu_{\mathrm{C,QPO}}$) and the optical depth of the Compton emission ($\tau$), and a positive correlation between $\nu_{\mathrm{C,QPO}}$ and $\Gamma$. These correlations strongly suggest a coupling between the QPO properties and the underlying process responsible for Comptonization. We also found that the last detection of type-C QPO coincide with the transient jet ejection within a timescale of one hour.</description>

Abstract: We present the largest 3D Particle-in-Cell shearing-box simulations of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability, for the first time employing the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio. We investigate the energy partition between relativistically hot electrons and subrelativistic ions in turbulent accretion flows, a regime relevant to collisionless, radiatively inefficient accretion flows of supermassive black holes, such as those targeted by the Event Horizon Telescope. We provide a simple empirical formula to describe the measured heating ratio between ions and electrons, which can be used for more accurate global modeling of accretion flows with standard fluid approaches such as general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers At Resonant Microwave Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we update the calculation of the sight distance for narrow-band detectors such as resonant microwave cavities, and the resulting maximal event rate. We find that the largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems. Even in the most optimistic setup, these events are anticipated to be extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova (KN) detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new KNe. For this purpose, we simulate GW events assuming a data-driven, GW-motivated distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the optical light curves arising from r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejecta. We use the simulated population of KNe to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of KN detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates: $\sim 1-9$ ($2-9$) yr$^{-1}$ in O4, and $13-110$ ($18-110$) yr$^{-1}$ in O5. Of these events, we expect to detect BNS (NSBH) KNe with DECam at a per year rate of: $0-2$ ($0$) in O4, and $2-28$ ($0-3$) in O5, conditional on the uncertainty on the equation of state (EOS) and volumetric rates of the mergers. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable KN to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH. We release our GW simulations and the depths needed to detect a significant fraction of simulated KNe to enable the astronomical community to use them in their multimessenger campaigns and analyses.</description>

      <title>eROSITA X-ray Analysis of the PeVatron Candidate Westerlund 1</title>

Abstract: It is unclear which fraction of cosmic rays above an energy of 1 PeV is accelerated by the observed Galactic PeVatron population. These sources' gamma-ray data is typically degenerate between hadronic and leptonic emission scenarios, which hinders their straightforward association with the cosmic ray population. Here, we aimed to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios for the PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458, associated with the star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). We first studied the diffuse X-ray emission from Wd 1 to better understand if its origin is of thermal or nonthermal nature. In addition, we searched for X-ray synchrotron emission from the associated PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458 to put new constraints on the magnetic field strength and the leptonic particle population of this source. We used data from eROSITA on board the SRG orbital platform to spectrally analyze the diffuse emission from Wd 1 and HESS J1646-458. For Wd 1, we compared a purely thermal model and a model with a thermal and a nonthermal component. Next, we analyzed the spectra of four annuli around Wd 1 which coincide with HESS J1646-458 to search for synchrotron radiation. We find that eROSITA data cannot distinguish between thermal and nonthermal source scenarios for the diffuse emission from Wd 1 itself. In the case of HESS J1646-458, we find no evidence of synchrotron emission. We estimated an upper confidence bound of the synchrotron flux up to 40' around Wd 1 of 1.9e-3 keV-1 cm-2 s-1, which we used to study the spectral energy distribution of the source. From this, we obtained an upper 1 sigma bound on the magnetic field strength of HESS J1646-458 of 7 uG. This is compatible with a previous estimate in the literature for a fully leptonic source scenario. A purely leptonic emission scenario, a hadronic, and a hybrid one are compatible with our results.</description>

      <title>NICER observations of type-I X-ray bursts from the ultra-compact X-ray binary M15 X-2</title>

Abstract: Type-I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions caused by the unstable burning of accreted material on the surface of neutron stars. We report the detection of seven type-I X-ray bursts from the ultracompact X-ray binary M15 X-2 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its 2022 outburst. We found all the bursts occurred in the soft state and exhibited similar light curve profiles, with no cases of photospheric radius expansion. Time-resolved spectroscopy showed clear deviations from the blackbody model during the first ten seconds of all the bursts. The fits were improved by using the enhanced persistent emission method, which we interpret as evidence of burst-disk interaction. We compared the performance of these models against a neutron star atmosphere model and found it made no significant improvements. After analyzing the burst rise times and fuel composition, we propose that these bursts were powered by the burning of pure helium, confirming the ultracompact nature of the source.</description>

      <title>A hidden quasi-periodic oscillation in Cygnus X-1 revealed by NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cygnus X-1 is a high-mass black hole binary extensively studied since its discovery in 1964. Its rapid X-ray variability provides insights into accretion physics. Unlike other black hole X-ray binaries, its power spectra are generally featureless and modeled with two broad Lorentzians, without requiring narrow quasi-periodic oscillations. We investigate the possibility that some undetected variability components in power spectra may appear in the imaginary part of the cross spectra and the coherence function. Using NICER observations up to Cycle 6, we study the power, cross, and lag spectra, along with the coherence function, searching for these "imaginary" components. We simultaneously fit the power spectra in two energy bands, 0.3-2 keV and 2-12 keV, and the real and imaginary parts of the cross-spectrum with a multi-Lorentzian model. Assuming each Lorentzian is coherent between the two bands but incoherent with others, we predict intrinsic coherence and phase lags. he intrinsic coherence shows a narrow dip at a frequency increasing from ~1 Hz to ~6 Hz as the power-law index of the Comptonized component increases from ~1.8 to ~2.4. Simultaneously, the phase lags exhibit a steep increase (the "cliff") at the same frequencies. These features vanish when using energy bands similar to RXTE (e.g., 3-5 keV and 5-12 keV). A narrow Lorentzian component with low fractional rms and large phase lag is required to reproduce the coherence drop. Its rms and phase-lag spectra evolve systematically in the hardness-intensity diagram. This "imaginary" QPO behaves like a type-C QPO despite being undetectable in power spectra alone. Similar features in MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070 support this interpretation, suggesting this may be the first detection of a type-C QPO in Cygnus X-1.</description>

      <title>A Linear Decomposition Method to Analyze and Study Pulsar Mode Changes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the linear decomposition method (LDM), which we developed to detect and analyze pulsar profile variations and mode changing behaviour. We developed LDM utilizing the likelihood function approach assuming the Gaussian noise. The LDM projects pulse profiles onto significance-ordered orthonormal vector bases. We show that the method is similar to the principal component analysis (PCA), but LDM can handle more general situations. We use simulated dataset and data from the Kunming 40-m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of the LDM. We found that the LDM successfully identified mode changes for well-known mode-changing PSR B0329+54 and found a continuous pulse profile evolution for PSR B0355+54 . We also show that the LDM can be used to improve the timing precision for mode changing PSR B0329+54.</description>

      <title>Taking control of compressible modes: bulk viscosity and the turbulent dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many polyatomic astrophysical plasmas are compressible and out of chemical and thermal equilibrium, and yet, a means to carefully control the decay of compressible modes in these systems has largely been neglected. This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo processes, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To control the viscous properties of the compressible modes, we perform supersonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity $\nu_{\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\rm{Re}_{\rm bulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\rm{P}\nu \equiv \rm{Re}_{\rm bulk} / \rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$, where $\rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity Reynolds number. For $10^{-3} \leq \rm{P}\nu \leq \infty$, we explore a broad range of statistics critical to the dynamo problem. We derive a general framework for decomposing $E_{\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible terms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\nabla\otimes\mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that compressible modes play a dual role, growing and decaying $E_{\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the main driver of growth, even in supersonic dynamos. In the absence of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ ($\rm{P}\nu \to \infty$), compressible modes pile up on small-scales, creating a spectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\rm{P}\nu \approx 1$. As $\rm{P}\nu$ decreases, compressible modes are dissipated at increasingly larger scales, in turn suppressing incompressible modes through a coupling between viscosity operators. We emphasise the importance of further understanding the role of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas and direct numerical simulations that include compressibility.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between two gravitational lens equations in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virbhadra and Ellis have proposed a very accurate equation (referred to as VE equation) for the gravitational lens in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime [Phys. Rev. D 62,084003 (2000)], whereas an improved equation (referred to as OB equation) has been derived by Bozza [Phys. Rev. D 78, 103005 (2008)] based on a relation found by Ohanian [Am. J. Phys. 55, 428 (1987)]. The OB equation was rediscovered later by Takizawa, Ono and Asada [Phys. Rev. D, 102, 064060 (2020)]. VE and OB equations seem to be very different from each other. The present paper shows that there exists an unphysical branch in the VE equation. Consequently, the VE equation can be improved by removing the unphysical branch. The improved version of the VE equation is found to be the same as the OB equation when a suitable transformation is made between the deflection angles defined differently in the two formulations. An explicit expression of the transformation is found. We also argue possible numerical differences when the transformation between the deflection angles is ignored.</description>

      <title>Galactic Distribution of Supernovae and OB Associations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We update and extend a previous model by Higdon and Lingenfelter for the longitudinal profile of the N\,II intensity in the Galactic plane. The model is based on four logarithmic spiral arms, to which features like the Local Arm and local sources are added. Connecting then the N\,II to the H\,II emission, we use this model to determine the average spatial distribution of OBassociations in the Milky Way. Combined with a stellar mass and cluster distribution function, the model predicts the average spatial and temporal distribution of core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way. In addition to this average population, we account for supernovae from observed OB associations, providing thereby a more accurate description of the nearby Galaxy. The complete model is made publicly available in the python code SNOB.</description>

      <title>Zeeman effect in oscillations of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields. Some of them (soft-gamma repeaters, SGRs) demonstrate gigantic flares which nature is still unclear. At decay phase of such flares one often observes quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) which are treated as stellar oscillations triggered by the flares. We study, for the first time, magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars possessing toroidal magnetic fields confined in the stellar crust, without imposing axial symmetry of perturbations. We show that the Zeeman effect makes the oscillation spectrum much richer than for axially symmetric oscillations. The main properties of theoretical QPO spectra are discussed as well as their potential to interpret observations and explore magnetar physics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy from the perspective of multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy: future joint observations with short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Deep Optical Images of the Ejecta Nebula Around the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 8 (HD 62910)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the results of deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images of the bright WN6/WC4 Wolf-Rayet star WR~8 (HD~62910). These data show considerably more surrounding nebulosity than seen in prior imaging. The brighter portions of the nebula span $\simeq6'$ in diameter and exhibit considerable fine-scale structure including numerous emission clumps and bright head-tail like features presumably due to the effects of the WR star's stellar winds. Due to the overlap of a relatively bright band of unrelated foreground diffuse interstellar H$\alpha$ emission, WR~8's nebula is best viewed via its [O III] emission. A faint $9' \times 13'$ diffuse outer nebulosity is detected surrounding the nebula's main ring of emission. Comparison of the nebula's optical structure with that seen in WISE 22 $\mu$m data shows a similarly clumpy structure but in a better defined emission shell of thermal continuum from dust. The infrared shell is coincident with the nebula's southern [O III] emissions but is mainly seen in the fainter outer portions of the northern [O III] emission clumps. It is this greater radial distance of dust emission in the nebula's northern areas that leads to a striking off-center position of the WR star in the IR shell.</description>

      <title>Mind the gap: addressing data gaps and assessing noise mismodeling in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the sheer complexity of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission, data gaps arising from instrumental irregularities and/or scheduled maintenance are unavoidable. Focusing on merger-dominated massive black hole binary signals, we test the appropriateness of the Whittle-likelihood on gapped data in a variety of cases. From first principles, we derive the likelihood valid for gapped data in both the time and frequency domains. Cheap-to-evaluate proxies to p-p plots are derived based on a Fisher-based formalism, and verified through Bayesian techniques. Our tools allow to predict the altered variance in the parameter estimates that arises from noise mismodeling, as well as the information loss represented by the broadening of the posteriors. The result of noise mismodeling with gaps is sensitive to the characteristics of the noise model, with strong low-frequency (red) noise and strong high-frequency (blue) noise giving statistically significant fluctuations in recovered parameters. We demonstrate that the introduction of a tapering window reduces statistical inconsistency errors, at the cost of less precise parameter estimates. We also show that the assumption of independence between inter-gap segments appears to be a fair approximation even if the data set is inherently coherent. However, if one instead assumes fictitious correlations in the data stream, when the data segments are actually independent, then the resultant parameter recoveries could be inconsistent with the true parameters. The theoretical and numerical practices that are presented in this work could readily be incorporated into global-fit pipelines operating on gapped data.</description>
