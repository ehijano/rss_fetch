      <title>Wave-driven phase wave patterns in a ring of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a biomimetic model that simulates a cell, with the internal cytoplasm represented by a two-dimensional circular domain and the external cortex by a surrounding ring, both modeled using FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. The external ring is dynamically influenced by a pacemaker-driven wave originating from the internal domain, leading to the emergence of three distinct dynamical states based on the varying strengths of coupling. The range of dynamics observed includes phase patterning, the propagation of phase waves, and interactions between traveling and phase waves. A simplified linear model effectively explains the mechanisms behind the variety of phase patterns observed, providing insights into the complex interplay between a cell's internal and external environments.</description>

      <title>Electroporation-mediated Metformin for effective anticancer treatment of triple-negative breast cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we investigated the efficacy of Metformin, the most commonly administered type-2 diabetes drug for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment, due to its various anticancer properties. It is a plant-based bio-compound, synthesized as a novel biguanide, called dimethyl biguanide or metformin. One of the ways it operates is by hindering electron transport chain-complex I, in mitochondria, which causes a drop-in energy (ATP) generation. This eventually builds energetic stress and a decline in energy. Therefore, the natural cellular processes and proliferating tumor cells are obstructed. Here, we used electroporation, where, the MDA-MB-231, human TNBC cells were subjected to high intensity, short-duration electrical pulses (EP) in the presence of Metformin. The cell viability results indicate lower cell viability of 43.45% as compared to 85.20% with drug alone at 5mM concentration. This indicates that Metformin, the most common diabetes drug could also be explored for cancer treatment.</description>
