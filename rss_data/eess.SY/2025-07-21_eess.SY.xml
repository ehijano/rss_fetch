      <title>Heatwave-driven air conditioning adoption could increase German electricity demand by 14 GW in the near future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensifying heatwaves driven by climate change are accelerating the adoption of mobile air conditioning (AC) systems. A rapid mass adoption of such AC systems could create additional stress on electricity grids and the power system. This study presents a novel method to estimate the electricity demand from AC systems both at system level and at high temporal and spatial granularity. We apply the method to a near-future heatwave scenario in Germany in which household AC adoption increases from current 19% to 35% during a heatwave similar to the one of July 2025. We analyze the effects for 196,428 grid cells of one square kilometer across Germany, by combining weather data, census data, socio-demographic assumptions, mobility patterns, and temperature-dependent AC activation functions. We find that electricity demand of newly purchased mobile AC systems could increase the peak load by over 14 GW (23%), with urban hot-spots reaching 5.8 MW per square kilometer. The temporal pattern creates a pronounced afternoon peak that coincides with lower photovoltaic generation, potentially exacerbating power system stability challenges. Our findings underscore the urgency for proactive energy system planning to manage emerging demand peaks.</description>

      <title>MD-OFDM: An Energy-Efficient and Low-PAPR MIMO-OFDM Variant for Resource-Constrained Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) combined with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques forms the backbone of modern wireless communication systems. While offering high spectral efficiency and robustness, conventional MIMO-OFDM, especially with complex equalizers like Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), suffers from high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and significant power consumption due to multiple active Radio Frequency (RF) chains. This paper proposes and mathematically models an alternative system, termed Multi-Dimensional OFDM (MD-OFDM), which employs a per-subcarrier transmit antenna selection strategy. By activating only one transmit antenna for each subcarrier, MD-OFDM aims to reduce PAPR, lower power consumption, and improve Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. We provide detailed mathematical formulations for BER, Energy Efficiency (EE), and PAPR, and discuss the suitability of MD-OFDM for various applications, particularly in energy-constrained and cost-sensitive scenarios such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). Simulation results demonstrate that MD-OFDM achieves superior BER and significantly lower PAPR compared to MMSE MIMO, albeit with a trade-off in peak overall energy efficiency due to reduced spectral multiplexing.</description>

      <title>Spacecraft Safe Robust Control Using Implicit Neural Representation for Geometrically Complex Targets in Proximity Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of ensuring safe spacecraft proximity operations, focusing on collision avoidance between a chaser spacecraft and a complex-geometry target spacecraft under disturbances. To ensure safety in such scenarios, a safe robust control framework is proposed that leverages implicit neural representations. To handle arbitrary target geometries without explicit modeling, a neural signed distance function (SDF) is learned from point cloud data via a enhanced implicit geometric regularization method, which incorporates an over-apporximation strategy to create a conservative, safety-prioritized boundary. The target's surface is implicitly defined by the zero-level set of the learned neural SDF, while the values and gradients provide critical information for safety controller design. This neural SDF representation underpins a two-layer hierarchcial safe robust control framework: a safe velocity generation layer and a safe robust controller layer. In the first layer, a second-order cone program is formulated to generate safety-guaranteed reference velocity by explicitly incorporating the under-approximation error bound. Furthermore, a circulation inequality is introduced to mitigate the local minimum issues commonly encountered in control barrier function (CBF) methods. The second layer features an integrated disturbance observer and a smooth safety filter explicitly compensating for estimation error, bolstering robustness to external disturbances. Extensive numerical simulations and Monte Carlo analysis validate the proposed framework, demonstrating significantly improved safety margins and avoidance of local minima compared to conventional CBF approaches.</description>

      <title>Minimum Clustering of Matrices Based on Phase Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating multi-agent systems requires balancing synchronization performance and controller implementation costs. To this end, we classify agents by their intrinsic properties, enabling each group to be controlled by a uniform controller and thus reducing the number of unique controller types required. Existing centralized control methods, despite their capability to achieve high synchronization performance with fewer types of controllers, suffer from critical drawbacks such as limited scalability and vulnerability to single points of failure. On the other hand, distributed control strategies, where controllers are typically agent-dependent, result in the type of required controllers increasing proportionally with the size of the system.
  This paper introduces a novel phase-alignment-based framework to minimize the type of controllers by strategically clustering agents with aligned synchronization behaviors. Leveraging the intrinsic phase properties of complex matrices, we formulate a constrained clustering problem and propose a hierarchical optimization method combining recursive exact searches for small-scale systems and scalable stochastic approximations for large-scale networks. This work bridges theoretical phase analysis with practical control synthesis, offering a cost-effective solution for large-scale multi-agent systems. The theoretical results applied for the analysis of a 50-agent network illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Robust Probability Hypothesis Density Filtering: Theory and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-target tracking (MTT) serves as a cornerstone technology in information fusion, yet faces significant challenges in robustness and efficiency when dealing with model uncertainties, clutter interference, and target interactions. Conventional approaches like Gaussian Mixture PHD (GM-PHD) and Cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filters suffer from inherent limitations including combinatorial explosion, sensitivity to birth/death process parameters, and numerical instability. This study proposes an innovative minimax robust PHD filtering framework with four key contributions: (1) A theoretically derived robust GM-PHD recursion algorithm that achieves optimal worst-case error control under bounded uncertainties; (2) An adaptive real-time parameter adjustment mechanism ensuring stability and error bounds; (3) A generalized heavy-tailed measurement likelihood function maintaining polynomial computational complexity; (4) A novel partition-based credibility weighting method for extended targets. The research not only establishes rigorous convergence guarantees and proves the uniqueness of PHD solutions, but also verifies algorithmic equivalence with standard GM-PHD. Experimental results demonstrate that in high-clutter environments, this method achieves a remarkable 32.4% reduction in OSPA error and 25.3% lower cardinality RMSE compared to existing techniques, while maintaining real-time processing capability at 15.3 milliseconds per step. This breakthrough lays a crucial foundation for reliable MTT in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Safe and Performant Controller Synthesis using Gradient-based Model Predictive Control and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring both performance and safety is critical for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments. While safety filters such as Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce constraints by modifying nominal controllers in real time, they can become overly conservative when the nominal policy lacks safety awareness. Conversely, solving State-Constrained Optimal Control Problems (SC-OCPs) via dynamic programming offers formal guarantees but is intractable in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) with CBF-based safety filtering for co-optimizing safety and performance. In the first stage, we relax safety constraints as penalties in the cost function, enabling fast optimization via gradient-based methods. This step improves scalability and avoids feasibility issues associated with hard constraints. In the second stage, we modify the resulting controller using a CBF-based Quadratic Program (CBF-QP), which enforces hard safety constraints with minimal deviation from the reference. Our approach yields controllers that are both performant and provably safe. We validate the proposed framework on two case studies, showcasing its ability to synthesize scalable, safe, and high-performance controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Fixed time convergence guarantees for Higher Order Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for designing higher-order Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that guarantee convergence to a safe set within a user-specified finite. Traditional Higher Order CBFs (HOCBFs) ensure asymptotic safety but lack mechanisms for fixed-time convergence, which is critical in time-sensitive and safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation. In contrast, our approach imposes a structured differential constraint using repeated roots in the characteristic polynomial, enabling closed-form polynomial solutions with exact convergence at a prescribed time. We derive conditions on the barrier function and its derivatives that ensure forward invariance and fixed-time reachability, and we provide an explicit formulation for second-order systems. Our method is evaluated on three robotic systems - a point-mass model, a unicycle, and a bicycle model and benchmarked against existing HOCBF approaches. Results demonstrate that our formulation reliably enforces convergence within the desired time, even when traditional methods fail. This work provides a tractable and robust framework for real-time control with provable finite-time safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Robust Periodic Controller for Spacecraft Attitude Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for robust periodic attitude control of satellites. Respecting the periodicity of the satellite dynamics in the synthesis allows to achieve constant performance and robustness requirements over the orbit. The proposed design follows a mixed sensitivity control design employing a physically motivated weighting scheme. The controller is calculated using a novel structured linear time-periodic output feedback synthesis with guaranteed optimal L2-performance. The synthesis poses a convex optimization problem and avoids grid-wise evaluations of coupling conditions inherent for classical periodic H-infinity-synthesis. Moreover, the controller has a transparent and easy to implement structure. A solar power plant satellite is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for periodic satellite attitude control.</description>

      <title>Identifiability Analysis of a Pseudo-Two-Dimensional Model &amp; Single Particle Model-Aided Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution presents a parameter identification methodology for the accurate and fast estimation of model parameters in a pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) battery model. The methodology consists of three key elements. First, the data for identification is inspected and specific features herein that need to be captured are included in the model. Second, the P2D model is analyzed to assess the identifiability of the physical model parameters and propose alternative parameterizations that alleviate possible issues. Finally, diverse operating conditions are considered that excite distinct battery dynamics which allows the use of different low-order battery models accordingly. Results show that, under low current conditions, the use of low-order models achieve parameter estimates at least 500 times faster than using the P2D model at the expense of twice the error. However, if accuracy is a must, these estimated parameters can be used to initialize the P2D model and perform the identification in half of the time.</description>

      <title>Diffraction and Scattering Modeling for Laser Power Beaming in Lunar Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable energy delivery is a critical requirement for
  long-term lunar missions, particularly in regions with limited
  solar access, such as polar craters and during extended lunar
  nights. Optical Power Beaming (OPB) using high-power lasers
  offers a promising alternative to conventional solar power, but
  the effects of suspended lunar dust on beam propagation remain
  poorly understood. This study introduces a detailed simulation
  model that incorporates both diffraction and height-dependent
  scattering by the electrostatically suspended lunar regolith. Un like prior approaches, which assumed uniform dust layers or
  center-to-center transmission loss, our model uses generalized
  diffraction theory and refractive index gradients derived from
  particle density to assess beam deformation and attenuation. The
  results show that even in ground-to-ground scenarios, lunar dust
  significantly degrades energy transfer efficiency, dropping from
  57% to 3.7% over 50 km in dust-free vs. dusty conditions with
  175 nm particles. Increasing the particle size to 250 nm limits the
  viable transmission range to below 30 km at 6% efficiency. The
  study further demonstrates that raising the laser source height
  can improve efficiency, achieving 91% for a distance of 5 km
  and 25% at 50 km when the source is positioned 12 m above
  ground. These findings underscore the importance of system
  elevation and dust modeling in lunar OPB design and reveal
  the mission-critical role of particle size distribution, especially in
  environments disturbed by human activity.</description>

      <title>Smart fault detection in satellite electrical power system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an new approach for detecting in the electrical power system of satellites operating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) without an Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS). Components of these systems are prone to faults, such as line-to-line faults in the photovoltaic subsystem, open circuits, and short circuits in the DC-to-DC converter, as well as ground faults in batteries. In the previous research has largely focused on detecting faults in each components, such as photovoltaic arrays or converter systems, therefore, has been limited attention given to whole electrical power system of satellite as a whole system. Our approach addresses this gap by utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model, which leverages input data such as solar radiation and surface temperature to predict current and load outputs. These machine learning techniques that classifiy use different approaches like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to classify faults effectively. The model presented achieves over 99% accuracy in identifying faults across multiple subsystems, marking a notable advancement from previous approaches by offering a complete diagnostic solution for the entire satellite power system. This thorough method boosts system reliability and helps lower the chances of mission failure</description>

      <title>Influence of Cell Position on the Capacity of Retired Batteries: Experimental and Statistical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how batteries perform after automotive use is crucial to determining their potential for reuse. This article presents experimental results aimed at advancing knowledge of retired battery performance. Three modules extracted from electric vehicles were tested. Their performance was assessed, and the results were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The 36 retired cells exhibited a high level of performance, albeit with significant variation. On average, the cells had a 95% state of health capacity with a dispersion of 2.4%. ANOVA analysis suggests that cell performance is not correlated with their position inside the module. These results demonstrate the need to evaluate dispersion within retired batteries and to develop thermal management and balancing systems for second-life batteries.</description>

      <title>Reference-Free Iterative Learning Model Predictive Control with Neural Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reference-free iterative learning model predictive control (MPC). In the proposed method, a certificate function based on the concept of Control Lyapunov Barrier Function (CLBF) is learned using data collected from past control executions and used to define the terminal set and cost in the MPC optimization problem at the current iteration. This scheme enables the progressive refinement of the MPC's terminal components over successive iterations. Unlike existing methods that rely on mixed-integer programming and suffer from numerical difficulties, the proposed approach formulates the MPC optimization problem as a standard nonlinear program, enabling more efficient online computation. The proposed method satisfies key MPC properties, including recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. Additionally, we demonstrate that the performance cost is non-increasing with respect to the number of iterations, under certain assumptions. Numerical experiments including the simulation with PyBullet confirm that our control scheme iteratively enhances control performance and significantly improves online computational efficiency compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided gated recurrent units for inversion-based feedforward control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inversion-based feedforward control relies on an accurate model that describes the inverse system dynamics. The gated recurrent unit (GRU), which is a recent architecture in recurrent neural networks, is a strong candidate for obtaining such a model from data. However, due to their black-box nature, GRUs face challenges such as limited interpretability and vulnerability to overfitting. Recently, physics-guided neural networks (PGNNs) have been introduced, which integrate the prior physical model structure into the prediction process. This approach not only improves training convergence, but also facilitates the learning of a physics-based model. In this work, we integrate a GRU in the PGNN framework to obtain a PG-GRU, based on which we adopt a two-step approach to feedforward control design. First, we adopt stable inversion techniques to design a stable linear model of the inverse dynamics. Then, a GRU trained on the residual is tailored to inverse system identification. The resulting PG-GRU feedforward controller is validated by means of real-life experiments on a two-mass spring-damper system, where it demonstrates roughly a two-fold improvement compared to the linear feedforward and a preview-based GRU feedforward in terms of the integral absolute error.</description>

      <title>Convex computation of regions of attraction from data using Sums-of-Squares programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper concentrates on the analysis of the region of attraction (ROA) for unknown autonomous dynamical systems. The aim is to explore a data-driven approach based on moment-sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy, which enables novel RoA outer approximations despite the reduced information on the structure of the dynamics. The main contribution of this work is bypassing the system model and, consequently, the recurring constraint on its polynomial structure. Numerical experimentation showcases the influence of data on learned approximating sets, offering a promising outlook on the potential of this method.</description>

      <title>Integrating Forecasting Models Within Steady-State Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather variations and the increasing unpredictability of load behavior make it difficult to determine power grid dispatches that are robust to uncertainties. While machine learning (ML) methods have improved the ability to model uncertainty caused by loads and renewables, accurately integrating these forecasts and their sensitivities into steady-state analyses and decision-making strategies remains an open challenge. Toward this goal, we present a generalized methodology that seamlessly embeds ML-based forecasting engines within physics-based power flow and grid optimization tools. By coupling physics-based grid modeling with black-box ML methods, we accurately capture the behavior and sensitivity of loads and weather events by directly integrating the inputs and outputs of trained ML forecasting models into the numerical methods of power flow and grid optimization. Without fitting surrogate load models, our approach obtains the sensitivities directly from data to accurately predict the response of forecasted devices to changes in the grid. Our approach combines the sensitivities of forecasted devices attained via backpropagation and the sensitivities of physics-defined grid devices. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by showcasing improvements in sensitivity calculations and leveraging them to design a robust power dispatch that improves grid reliability under stochastic weather events. Our approach enables the computation of system sensitivities to exogenous factors which supports broader analyses that improve grid reliability in the presence of load variability and extreme weather conditions.</description>

      <title>PGR-DRC: Pre-Global Routing DRC Violation Prediction Using Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and automation (EDA) tools, high-performance computing, and parallelized algorithms are essential for next-generation microprocessor innovation, ensuring continued progress in computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. Machine learning-based design rule checking (DRC) and lithography hotspot detection can improve first-pass silicon success. However, conventional ML and neural network (NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset (in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy, respectively. In addition, the proposed methodology has about 26.3x and up to 6003x lower training times compared to SVM and NN-models, respectively.</description>

      <title>Model-free Reinforcement Learning for Model-based Control: Towards Safe, Interpretable and Sample-efficient Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions, while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents -- exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies, along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored, motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents.</description>

      <title>Human-Like Trajectories Generation via Receding Horizon Tracking Applied to the TickTacking Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TickTacking is a rhythm-based interface that allows users to control a pointer in a two-dimensional space through dual-button tapping. This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration</description>

      <title>Single spin exact gradients for the optimization of complex pulses and pulse sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient computer optimization of magnetic resonance pulses and pulse sequences involves the calculation of a problem-adapted cost function as well as its gradients with respect to all controls applied. The gradients generally can be calculated as a finite difference approximation, as a GRAPE approximation, or as an exact function, e.g. by the use of the augmented matrix exponentiation, where the exact gradient should lead to best optimization convergence. However, calculation of exact gradients is computationally expensive and analytical exact solutions to the problem would be highly desirable. As the majority of todays pulse optimizations involve a single spin 1/2, which can be represented by simple rotation matrices in the Bloch space or by their corresponding Cayley-Klein/quaternion parameters, the derivations of analytical exact gradient functions appear to be feasible. Taking two optimization types, the optimization of point-to-point pulses using 3D-rotations and the optimization of universal rotation pulses using quaternions, analytical solutions for gradients with respect to controls have been derived. Controls in this case can be conventional $x$ and $y$ pulses, but also $z$-controls, as well as gradients with respect to amplitude and phase of a pulse shape. In addition, analytical solutions with respect to pseudo controls, involving holonomic constraints to maximum rf-amplitudes, maximum rf-power, or maximum rf-energy, are introduced. Using the hyperbolic tangent function, maximum values are imposed in a fully continuous and differentiable way. The obtained analytical gradients allow the calculation two orders of magnitude faster than the augmented matrix exponential approach. The exact gradients for different controls are finally compared in a number of optimizations involving broadband pulses for $^{15}$N, $^{13}$C, and $^{19}$F applications.</description>

      <title>Conformal Contraction for Robust Nonlinear Control with Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel robust control framework for continuous-time, perturbed nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty that depends nonlinearly on both the state and control inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that impose structural assumptions on the uncertainty, our framework enhances contraction-based robust control with data-driven uncertainty prediction, remaining agnostic to the models of the uncertainty and predictor. We statistically quantify how reliably the contraction conditions are satisfied under dynamics with uncertainty via conformal prediction, thereby obtaining a distribution-free and finite-time probabilistic guarantee for exponential boundedness of the trajectory tracking error. We further propose the probabilistically robust control invariant (PRCI) tube for distributionally robust motion planning, within which the perturbed system trajectories are guaranteed to stay with a finite probability, without explicit knowledge of the uncertainty model. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed robust control framework and the performance of the PRCI tube.</description>

      <title>Safe Robotic Capsule Cleaning with Integrated Transpupillary and Intraocular Optical Coherence Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secondary cataract is one of the most common complications of vision loss due to the proliferation of residual lens materials that naturally grow on the lens capsule after cataract surgery. A potential treatment is capsule cleaning, a surgical procedure that requires enhanced visualization of the entire capsule and tool manipulation on the thin membrane. This article presents a robotic system capable of performing the capsule cleaning procedure by integrating a standard transpupillary and an intraocular optical coherence tomography probe on a surgical instrument for equatorial capsule visualization and real-time tool-to-tissue distance feedback. Using robot precision, the developed system enables complete capsule mapping in the pupillary and equatorial regions with in-situ calibration of refractive index and fiber offset, which are still current challenges in obtaining an accurate capsule model. To demonstrate effectiveness, the capsule mapping strategy was validated through five experimental trials on an eye phantom that showed reduced root-mean-square errors in the constructed capsule model, while the cleaning strategy was performed in three ex-vivo pig eyes without tissue damage.</description>

      <title>Resource-Splitting Games with Tullock-Based Lossy Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of multi-stage resource allocation games that model real-world scenarios in which profitability depends on the balance between supply and demand, and where higher resource investment leads to greater returns. Our proposed framework, which incorporates the notion of profit loss due to insufficient player participation, gives rise to a Tullock-like functional form of the stage payoff structure when weighted fair proportional resource allocation is applied. We explore both centralized and Nash equilibrium strategies, establish sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness, and provide an iterative, semi-decentralized method to compute the Nash equilibrium in games with arbitrarily many players. Additionally, we demonstrate that the framework generalizes instances of several existing models, including Receding Horizon and Blotto games, and present a semi-analytical method for computing the unique Nash equilibrium within the Blotto setup. Our findings are validated through a numerical case study in smart mobility, highlighting the practical relevance and applicability of the proposed model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesising safe controllers from visual data typically requires extensive supervised labelling of safety-critical data, which is often impractical in real-world settings. Recent advances in world models enable reliable prediction in latent spaces, opening new avenues for scalable and data-efficient safe control. In this work, we introduce a semi-supervised framework that leverages control barrier certificates (CBCs) learned in the latent space of a world model to synthesise safe visuomotor policies. Our approach jointly learns a neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data, while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent dynamics modelling.</description>

      <title>Device-Free Localization Using Commercial UWB Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers have enabled not only measuring device-to-device distance but also tracking the position of a pedestrian who does not carry a UWB device. UWB-based device-free localization that does not require dedicated radar equipment is compatible with existing anchor infrastructure and can be reused to reduce hardware deployment costs. However, it is difficult to estimate the target's position accurately in real-world scenarios due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the cluttered environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-assisted particle filter to overcome these challenges. First, the channel impulse response (CIR) variance is analyzed to capture the variability induced by the target's movement. Then, a DL-based one-dimensional attention U-Net is used to extract only the reflection components caused by the target and suppress the noise components within the CIR variance profile. Finally, multiple preprocessed CIR variance profiles are used as input to a particle filter to estimate the target's position. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is a practical and cost-effective solution for IoT and automotive applications with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 15 cm and an average processing time of 4 ms. Furthermore, comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method provides the best performance with reasonable computational costs.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for Gaussian process regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR. Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis among Uncontrollable Dynamic Agents with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04242v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of dynamical systems under temporal logic specifications among uncontrollable dynamic agents is challenging due to the agents' a-priori unknown behavior. Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</description>

      <title>Reducing real-time complexity via sub-control Lyapunov functions: from theory to experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The techniques to design control Lyapunov functions (CLF), along with a proper stabilizing feedback, possibly in the presence of constraints, often provide control laws that are too complex for proper implementation online, especially when an optimization problem is involved. In this work, we show how to acquire an alternative, computationally attractive feedback. Given a nominal CLF and a nominal state feedback, we say that a different positive definite function is a Sub-control Lyapunov function (SCLF) if its Lyapunov derivative is negative-definite and bounded above by the Lyapunov derivative of the nominal function with the nominal control. It turns out that if we consider a family of basis functions, then a SCLF can be computed by linear programming, with an infinite number of constraints. The idea is that although the offline computational burden to achieve the new controller and solve the linear program is considerable, the online computational burden is drastically reduced. Comprehensive simulations and experiments on drone control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the study.</description>

      <title>Solving Optimal Power Flow on a Data-Budget: Feature Selection on Smart Meter Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How much data is needed to optimally schedule distributed energy resources (DERs)? Does the distribution system operator (DSO) have to know load demands at each bus of the feeder to solve an optimal power flow (OPF)? This work exploits redundancies in OPF's structure and data to minimize the communication of such a data deluge, and explores the trade-off between data compression and the grid's performance. We propose an OPF data distillation framework involving two steps: The DSO first collects OPF data from only a subset of nodes. It subsequently reconstructs the complete OPF data from the partial ones, and feeds them into the OPF solver. Selecting and reconstructing OPF data may be performed to maximize the fidelity of the reconstructed data or the associated OPF solutions. Under the first objective, OPF data distillation is posed as a sparsity-regularized convex problem. Under the second objective, it is posed as a sparsity-regularized bilevel program. Both problems are solved using proximal gradient algorithms. The second objective is superior in approximating OPF solutions at the expense of increased complexity. Numerical tests show that it enhances the fidelity and feasibility of the reconstructed OPF solutions, which can be approximated reasonably well even from partial data.</description>

      <title>A Cyber Insurance Policy for Hedging Against Load-Altering Attacks and Extreme Load Variations in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainties in renewable energy resources (RES) and load variations can lead to elevated system operational costs. Moreover, the emergence of large-scale distributed threats, such as load-altering attacks (LAAs), can induce substantial load variations, further exacerbating these costs. Although traditional defense measures can reduce the likelihood of such attacks, considerable residual risks remain. Thus, this paper proposes a cyber insurance framework designed to hedge against additional operational costs resulting from LAAs and substantial load variations in renewable-rich grids. The insurance framework determines both the insurance coverage and premium based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR). These risk metrics are calculated using the system failure probability and the probability density function (PDF) of the system operation cost. The system failure probability is assessed through a semi-Markov process (SMP), while the cost distribution is estimated through a cost minimization model of a distribution grid combined with a Monte-Carlo simulation to capture load variability. Furthermore, we employ a bi-level optimization scheme that identifies the specific load distribution leading to the maximum system cost, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the operation cost PDF estimation. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed cyber insurance policy are evaluated considering a modified IEEE-118 test bus system and the IEEE European low-voltage (LV) test feeders model. The case study shows that with a relatively low premium, the network operator can hedge against additional operational costs caused by malicious load manipulations.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time Two-Layered Forgetting RLS Identification under Finite Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, adaptive identification methods that can achieve the true value convergence of parameters without requiring persistent excitation (PE) have been widely studied, and concurrent learning has been intensively studied. However, the parameter convergence rate is limited for the gradient-based method owing to small parameter update gain, and even the introduction of forgetting factors does not work sufficiently. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel discrete-time recursive least squares method under finite excitation (FE) conditions using two forgetting factors (inner and outer) and an augmented regressor matrix comprising a sum of regressor vectors. The proposed method ensures the PE condition of the augmented regressor matrix under FE conditions of the regressor vector and allows the properly design of the forgetting factor without estimator windup and/or destabilization of the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with several conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Mixed-integer Second-Order Cone Programming for Multi-period Scheduling of Flexible AC Transmission System Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable sources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads, losses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their capacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the efficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of key FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model integrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for voltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv) thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and flow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited number of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at all times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the model employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific constraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt reactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power bounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A multi-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making, ensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE 9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce losses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.</description>

      <title>Equivalent and Compact Representations of Neural Network Controllers With Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, neural network (NN)-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in a variety of decision-making tasks. However, their black-box nature and the risk of unexpected behaviors pose a challenge to their deployment in real-world systems requiring strong guarantees of correctness and safety. We address these limitations by investigating the transformation of NN-based controllers into equivalent soft decision tree (SDT)-based controllers and its impact on verifiability. In contrast to existing work, we focus on discrete-output NN controllers including rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions as well as argmax operations. We then devise an exact yet efficient transformation algorithm which automatically prunes redundant branches. We first demonstrate the practical efficacy of the transformation algorithm applied to an autonomous driving NN controller within OpenAI Gym's CarRacing environment. Subsequently, we evaluate our approach using two benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym environment. Our results indicate that the SDT transformation can benefit formal verification, showing runtime improvements of up to $21 \times$ and $2 \times$ for MountainCar-v0 and CartPole-v1, respectively.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Imitation Learning via Generative Adversarial STL Inference and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning methods have demonstrated considerable success in teaching autonomous systems complex tasks through expert demonstrations. However, a limitation of these methods is their lack of interpretability, particularly in understanding the specific task the learning agent aims to accomplish. In this paper, we propose a novel imitation learning method that combines Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference and control synthesis, enabling the explicit representation of the task as an STL formula. This approach not only provides a clear understanding of the task but also supports the integration of human knowledge and allows for adaptation to out-of-distribution scenarios by manually adjusting the STL formulas and fine-tuning the policy. We employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-inspired approach to train both the inference and policy networks, effectively narrowing the gap between expert and learned policies. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated through simulations, showcasing its practical applicability and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Policy Verification in Stochastic Dynamical Systems Using Logarithmic Neural Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the verification of neural network policies for discrete-time stochastic systems with respect to reach-avoid specifications. We use a learner-verifier procedure that learns a certificate for the specification, represented as a neural network. Verifying that this neural network certificate is a so-called reach-avoid supermartingale (RASM) proves the satisfaction of a reach-avoid specification. Existing approaches for such a verification task rely on computed Lipschitz constants of neural networks. These approaches struggle with large Lipschitz constants, especially for reach-avoid specifications with high threshold probabilities. We present two key contributions to obtain smaller Lipschitz constants than existing approaches. First, we introduce logarithmic RASMs (logRASMs), which take exponentially smaller values than RASMs and hence have lower theoretical Lipschitz constants. Second, we present a fast method to compute tighter upper bounds on Lipschitz constants based on weighted norms. Our empirical evaluation shows we can consistently verify the satisfaction of reach-avoid specifications with probabilities as high as 99.9999%.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Metamaterial Absorber for Solar Energy Harvesting in the THz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the design and comprehensive characterization of a novel three-layer metamaterial absorber, engineered to exploit the unique optical properties of gold, vanadium dioxide, and silicon dioxide. At the core of this design, silicon dioxide serves as a robust substrate that supports an intricately structured layer of gold and a top layer of vanadium dioxide. This configuration is optimized to harness and enhance absorption capabilities effectively across a broadband terahertz (THz) spectrum. The absorber demonstrates an extensive absorption bandwidth of 3.00 THz, spanning frequencies from 2.414 THz to 5.417 THz. Remarkably, throughout this range, the device maintains a consistently high absorption efficiency, exceeding 90%. This efficiency is characterized by two sharp absorption peaks located at 2.638 THz and 5.158 THz, which signify the precise tuning of the metamaterial structure to interact optimally with specific THz frequencies. The absorbance of the proposed model is almost equal to 99%. This absorber is polarization insensitive. The development of this absorber involved a series of theoretical simulations backed by experimental validations, which helped refine the metamaterial's geometry and material composition. This process illuminated the critical role of the dielectric properties of silicon dioxide and the plasmonic effects induced by gold and vanadium dioxide layers, which collectively contribute to the high-performance metrics observed.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Operation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents in Real-World Network Management at Open RAN Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful solution for meeting the growing demands for connectivity, reliability, low latency and operational efficiency in advanced networks. However, most research has focused on theoretical analysis and simulations, with limited investigation into real-world deployment. To bridge the gap and support practical DRL deployment for network management, we first present an orchestration framework that integrates ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) with Open RAN, enabling seamless adoption of DRL-based strategies across different time scales while enhancing agent lifecycle management. We then identify three critical challenges hindering DRL's real-world deployment, including (1) asynchronous requests from unpredictable or bursty traffic, (2) adaptability and generalization across heterogeneous topologies and evolving service demands, and (3) prolonged convergence and service interruptions due to exploration in live operational environments. To address these challenges, we propose a three-fold solution strategy: (a) advanced time-series integration for handling asynchronized traffic, (b) flexible architecture design such as multi-agent DRL and incremental learning to support heterogeneous scenarios, and (c) simulation-driven deployment with transfer learning to reduce convergence time and service disruptions. Lastly, the feasibility of the MEC-O-RAN architecture is validated on an urban-wide testing infrastructure, and two real-world use cases are presented, showcasing the three identified challenges and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Stonefish: Supporting Machine Learning Research in Marine Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations are highly valuable in marine robotics, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment for testing in the challenging conditions of underwater and surface operations. Given the high costs and logistical difficulties of real-world trials, simulators capable of capturing the operational conditions of subsea environments have become key in developing and refining algorithms for remotely-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper highlights recent enhancements to the Stonefish simulator, an advanced open-source platform supporting development and testing of marine robotics solutions. Key updates include a suite of additional sensors, such as an event-based camera, a thermal camera, and an optical flow camera, as well as, visual light communication, support for tethered operations, improved thruster modelling, more flexible hydrodynamics, and enhanced sonar accuracy. These developments and an automated annotation tool significantly bolster Stonefish's role in marine robotics research, especially in the field of machine learning, where training data with a known ground truth is hard or impossible to collect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address safe multi-robot interaction under uncertainty. In particular, we formulate a chance-constrained linear quadratic Gaussian game with coupling constraints and system uncertainties. We find a tractable reformulation of the game and propose a dual ascent algorithm. We prove that the algorithm converges to a feedback generalized Nash equilibrium of the reformulated game, ensuring the satisfaction of the chance constraints. We test our method in driving simulations and real-world robot experiments. Our method ensures safety under uncertainty and generates less conservative trajectories than single-agent model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Deep Q-Learning with Gradient Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In the standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online network's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being periodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>
