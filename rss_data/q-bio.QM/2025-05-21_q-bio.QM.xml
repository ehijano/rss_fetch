      <title>Predicting Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Using Pre-Treatment Histopathologic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, resulting in limited targeted treatment options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the standard treatment for early-stage TNBC, with pathologic complete response (pCR) serving as a key prognostic marker; however, only 40-50% of patients with TNBC achieve pCR. Accurate prediction of NACT response is crucial to optimize therapy, avoid ineffective treatments, and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we developed a deep learning model to predict NACT response using pre-treatment hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained biopsy images. Our model achieved promising results in five-fold cross-validation (accuracy: 82%, AUC: 0.86, F1-score: 0.84, sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.81, precision: 0.80). Analysis of model attention maps in conjunction with multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data revealed that regions of high predictive importance consistently colocalized with tumor areas showing elevated PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and CD163+ macrophage density - all established biomarkers of treatment response. Our findings indicate that incorporating IHC-derived immune profiling data could substantially improve model interpretability and predictive performance. Furthermore, this approach may accelerate the discovery of novel histopathological biomarkers for NACT and advance the development of personalized treatment strategies for TNBC patients.</description>

      <title>iBitter-Stack: A Multi-Representation Ensemble Learning Model for Accurate Bitter Peptide Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of bitter peptides is crucial in various domains, including food science, drug discovery, and biochemical research. These peptides not only contribute to the undesirable taste of hydrolyzed proteins but also play key roles in physiological and pharmacological processes. However, experimental methods for identifying bitter peptides are time-consuming and expensive. With the rapid expansion of peptide sequence databases in the post-genomic era, the demand for efficient computational approaches to distinguish bitter from non-bitter peptides has become increasingly significant. In this study, we propose a novel stacking-based ensemble learning framework aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of bitter peptide classification. Our method integrates diverse sequence-based feature representations and leverages a broad set of machine learning classifiers. The first stacking layer comprises multiple base classifiers, each trained on distinct feature encoding schemes, while the second layer employs logistic regression to refine predictions using an eight-dimensional probability vector. Extensive evaluations on a carefully curated dataset demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing predictive methods, providing a robust and reliable computational tool for bitter peptide identification. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 96.09\% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9220 on the independent test set, underscoring its effectiveness and generalizability. To facilitate real-time usage and broader accessibility, we have also developed a user-friendly web server based on the proposed method, which is freely accessible at https://ibitter-stack-webserver.streamlit.app/. This tool enables researchers and practitioners to conveniently screen peptide sequences for bitterness in real-time applications.</description>

      <title>TxPert: Leveraging Biochemical Relationships for Out-of-Distribution Transcriptomic Perturbation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and designing effective therapies. Yet exhaustively exploring the space of possible perturbations (e.g., multi-gene perturbations or across tissues and cell types) is prohibitively expensive, motivating methods that can generalize to unseen conditions. In this work, we explore how knowledge graphs of gene-gene relationships can improve out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction across three challenging settings: unseen single perturbations; unseen double perturbations; and unseen cell lines. In particular, we present: (i) TxPert, a new state-of-the-art method that leverages multiple biological knowledge networks to predict transcriptional responses under OOD scenarios; (ii) an in-depth analysis demonstrating the impact of graphs, model architecture, and data on performance; and (iii) an expanded benchmarking framework that strengthens evaluation standards for perturbation modeling.</description>

      <title>Quantifying structural uncertainty in chemical reaction network inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems in chemistry and biology are complex, and one often does not have comprehensive knowledge about the interactions involved. Chemical reaction network (CRN) inference aims to identify, from observing species concentrations over time, the unknown reactions between the species. Existing approaches largely focus on identifying a single, most likely CRN, without addressing uncertainty about the resulting network structure. However, it is important to quantify structural uncertainty to have confidence in our inference and predictions. In this work, we do so by constructing an approximate posterior distribution over CRN structures. This is done by keeping a large set of suboptimal solutions found in an optimisation framework with sparse regularisation, in contrast to existing optimisation approaches which discard suboptimal solutions. We find that inducing reaction sparsity with nonconvex penalty functions results in more parsimonious CRNs compared to the popular lasso regularisation. In a real-data example where multiple CRNs have been previously suggested, we simultaneously recover reactions proposed from different literature under our approach to structural uncertainty. We demonstrate how posterior correlations between reactions help identify where structural ambiguities are present. This can be translated into alternative reaction pathways suggested by the available data, thus guiding the efforts of future experimental design.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Structural Identifiability of Epidemic Models Using StructuralIdentifiability.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural identifiability -- the theoretical ability to uniquely recover model parameters from ideal, noise-free data -- is a prerequisite for reliable parameter estimation in epidemic modeling. Despite its importance, structural identifiability analysis remains underutilized in the infectious disease modeling literature. In this tutorial, we present a practical and reproducible workflow for conducting structural identifiability analysis of ordinary differential equation models using the Julia package StructuralIdentifiability.jl. We apply the tool to a range of epidemic models, including SEIR variants with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, vector-borne systems, and models incorporating hospitalization and disease-induced mortality. We compare results from StructuralIdentifiability.jl with those obtained using DAISY, a widely used differential algebra tool, and highlight cases where the Julia package succeeds in analyzing models that DAISY cannot handle. In particular, StructuralIdentifiability.jl efficiently handles high-dimensional systems and provides symbolic checks for assumptions often overlooked in other methods. Our findings underscore how identifiability depends on model structure, the availability of initial conditions, and the choice of observed states. All code and diagrams are publicly available, making this tutorial a valuable reference for researchers and educators working with dynamic disease models.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of control zone restrictions on pig placement in simulated African swine fever in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease that poses a significant threat to the swine industry, requiring stringent control measures, including movement restrictions that delay pig placements, impacting business continuity. The number and economic impact of unplaced healthy animals due to control zone restrictions remains unmeasured. This study evaluates the economic and epidemiological impacts of control zone placement restrictions during simulated ASF outbreaks in U.S. commercial swine farms. We model the spread of ASF and apply the U.S. National Response Plan (NRP) alongside alternative mitigation strategies, analyzing key metrics such as the number of unplaced pigs, depopulated pigs, infected farms, and total economic losses. Our findings estimate the median number of unplaced pigs in the first year was 153,020 (IQR 27,377 to 1,307,899) under the NRP scenario. Shorter control zone durations (20 to 25 days) effectively reduce the median number of unplaced pigs by 16.7% to 33.5%, whereas longer durations (40 days) increase unplacement numbers by 32%. The median number of depopulated pigs remains broadly consistent across all durations. Expanding the infected zone (5 to 15 km) increases the median number of unplaced pigs by 53.6% to 282% while reducing depopulated pigs by 28.8% to 73.9%, respectively. Economic losses are estimated through a model that includes depopulated and unplaced animals requiring culling. We examined the situations when 5%, 12%, or 20% of unplaced pigs required culling and found that the total cost ranged from zero (no second infection) to over $800 million.</description>

      <title>Breast Cancer Classification Using Gradient Boosting Algorithms Focusing on Reducing the False Negative and SHAP for Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world, with breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer cases and consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early detection and, consequently, early treatment. Any development for detection or perdition this kind of cancer is important for a better healthy life. Many studies focus on a model with high accuracy in cancer prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may not always be a reliable metric. This study implies an investigative approach to studying the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on boosting to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting machine learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier that contains their attributes. The main objective of this study is to use state-of-the-art boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM to predict and diagnose breast cancer and to find the most effective metric regarding recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. Furthermore, our study is the first to use these four boosting algorithms with Optuna, a library for hyperparameter optimization, and the SHAP method to improve the interpretability of our model, which can be used as a support to identify and predict breast cancer. We were able to improve AUC or recall for all the models and reduce the False Negative for AdaBoost and LigthGBM the final AUC were more than 99.41\% for all models.</description>

      <title>Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</description>

      <title>PoseX: AI Defeats Physics Approaches on Protein-Ligand Cross Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing protein-ligand docking studies typically focus on the self-docking scenario, which is less practical in real applications. Moreover, some studies involve heavy frameworks requiring extensive training, posing challenges for convenient and efficient assessment of docking methods. To fill these gaps, we design PoseX, an open-source benchmark to evaluate both self-docking and cross-docking, enabling a practical and comprehensive assessment of algorithmic advances. Specifically, we curated a novel dataset comprising 718 entries for self-docking and 1,312 entries for cross-docking; second, we incorporated 23 docking methods in three methodological categories, including physics-based methods (e.g., Schr\"odinger Glide), AI docking methods (e.g., DiffDock) and AI co-folding methods (e.g., AlphaFold3); third, we developed a relaxation method for post-processing to minimize conformational energy and refine binding poses; fourth, we built a leaderboard to rank submitted models in real-time. We derived some key insights and conclusions from extensive experiments: (1) AI approaches have consistently outperformed physics-based methods in overall docking success rate. (2) Most intra- and intermolecular clashes of AI approaches can be greatly alleviated with relaxation, which means combining AI modeling with physics-based post-processing could achieve excellent performance. (3) AI co-folding methods exhibit ligand chirality issues, except for Boltz-1x, which introduced physics-inspired potentials to fix hallucinations, suggesting modeling on stereochemistry improves the structural plausibility markedly. (4) Specifying binding pockets significantly promotes docking performance, indicating that pocket information can be leveraged adequately, particularly for AI co-folding methods, in future modeling efforts. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are released at https://github.com/CataAI/PoseX.</description>
