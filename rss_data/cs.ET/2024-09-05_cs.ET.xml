      <title>Semantic Communication for Efficient Point Cloud Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As three-dimensional acquisition technologies like LiDAR cameras advance, the need for efficient transmission of 3D point clouds is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present a novel semantic communication (SemCom) approach for efficient 3D point cloud transmission. Different from existing methods that rely on downsampling and feature extraction for compression, our approach utilizes a parallel structure to separately extract both global and local information from point clouds. This system is composed of five key components: local semantic encoder, global semantic encoder, channel encoder, channel decoder, and semantic decoder. Our numerical results indicate that this approach surpasses both the traditional Octree compression methodology and alternative deep learning-based strategies in terms of reconstruction quality. Moreover, our system is capable of achieving high-quality point cloud reconstruction under adverse channel conditions, specifically maintaining a reconstruction quality of over 37dB even with severe channel noise.</description>

      <title>A Silicon Photonic Neural Network for Chromatic Dispersion Compensation in 20 Gbps PAM4 Signal at 125 km and Its Scalability up to 100 Gbps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A feed-forward photonic neural network (PNN) is tested for chromatic dispersion compensation in Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection optical links. The PNN is based on a sequence of linear and nonlinear transformations. The linear stage is constituted by an 8-tap time-delayed complex perceptron implemented on a Silicon-On-insulator platform and acting as a tunable optical filter. The nonlinear stage is provided by the square modulus of the electrical field applied at the end-of-line photodetector. The training maximizes the separation between the optical levels (i.e. the eye diagram aperture), with consequent reduction of the Bit Error Rate. Effective equalization is experimentally demonstrated for 20 Gbps 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated signal up to 125 km. An evolutionary algorithm and a gradient-based approach are tested for the training and then compared in terms of repeatability and convergence time. The optimal weights resulting from the training are interpreted in light of the theoretical transfer function of the optical fiber. Finally, a simulative study proves the scalability of the layout to larger bandwidths, up to 100 Gbps.</description>

      <title>DasAtom: A Divide-and-Shuttle Atom Approach to Quantum Circuit Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom (NA) quantum systems are emerging as a leading platform for quantum computation, offering superior or competitive qubit count and gate fidelity compared to superconducting circuits and ion traps. However, the unique features of NA devices, such as long-range interactions, long qubit coherence time, and the ability to physically move qubits, present distinct challenges for quantum circuit compilation. In this paper, we introduce DasAtom, a novel divide-and-shuttle atom approach designed to optimise quantum circuit transformation for NA devices by leveraging these capabilities. DasAtom partitions circuits into subcircuits, each associated with a qubit mapping that allows all gates within the subcircuit to be directly executed. The algorithm then shuttles atoms to transition seamlessly from one mapping to the next, enhancing both execution efficiency and overall fidelity. For a 30-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), DasAtom achieves a 414x improvement in fidelity over the move-based algorithm Enola and a 10.6x improvement over the SWAP-based algorithm Tetris. Notably, this improvement is expected to increase exponentially with the number of qubits, positioning DasAtom as a highly promising solution for scaling quantum computation on NA platforms.</description>

      <title>Content Moderation by LLM: From Accuracy to Legitimacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One trending application of LLM (large language model) is to use it for content moderation in online platforms. Most current studies on this application have focused on the metric of accuracy - the extent to which LLM makes correct decisions about content. This article argues that accuracy is insufficient and misleading, because it fails to grasp the distinction between easy cases and hard cases as well as the inevitable trade-offs in achieving higher accuracy. Closer examination reveals that content moderation is a constitutive part of platform governance, the key of which is to gain and enhance legitimacy. Instead of making moderation decisions correct, the chief goal of LLM is to make them legitimate. In this regard, this article proposes a paradigm shift from the single benchmark of accuracy towards a legitimacy-based framework of evaluating the performance of LLM moderators. The framework suggests that for easy cases, the key is to ensure accuracy, speed and transparency, while for hard cases, what matters is reasoned justification and user participation. Examined under this framework, LLM's real potential in moderation is not accuracy improvement. Rather, LLM can better contribute in four other aspects: to conduct screening of hard cases from easy cases, to provide quality explanations for moderation decisions, to assist human reviewers in getting more contextual information, and to facilitate user participation in a more interactive way. Using normative theories from law and social sciences to critically assess the new technological application, this article seeks to redefine LLM's role in content moderation and redirect relevant research in this field.</description>

      <title>Memristors based Computation and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristor has been identified as the fourth fundamental circuit element by Dr. Leon Chua in 1971 and since then it has gathered a lot of interest because of its non-volatility and are considered as a viable solution to the beyond CMOS era computation. Recently, memristor have been used to perform basic logic operations like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR etc. and are also used in applications like Dot Product Engine, Convolution Neural Networks etc. This paper presents a new behavioural model of memristor then using it to build a 32-bit ripple carry adder. The paper later compares the area, power and time delay of the 32 bit Ripple Carry Adder using memristor with the 45nm CMOS technology and highlights its advantages and pitfalls.</description>

      <title>LLM-based event abstraction and integration for IoT-sourced logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous flow of data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has revolutionised our ability to understand and interact with the world across various applications. However, this data must be prepared and transformed into event data before analysis can begin. In this paper, we shed light on the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in event abstraction and integration. Our approach aims to create event records from raw sensor readings and merge the logs from multiple IoT sources into a single event log suitable for further Process Mining applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in event abstraction considering a case study for IoT application in elderly care and longitudinal health monitoring. The results, showing on average an accuracy of 90% in detecting high-level activities. These results highlight LLMs' promising potential in addressing event abstraction and integration challenges, effectively bridging the existing gap.</description>

      <title>SELCC: Coherent Caching over Compute-Limited Disaggregated Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes to save on round-trip communication cost between the disaggregated memory and the compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on the disaggregated memory servers makes it challenging to maintain cache coherence among multiple compute-side caches over disaggregated shared memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC builds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch release and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can guarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes communication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into RDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global concurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided cache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory. This abstraction layer provides main-memory-like APIs to upper-level applications, and thus enabling existing data structures and algorithms to function over disaggregated memory with minimal code change. To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we implement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over SELCC's APIs. Micro-benchmark results show that the SELCC protocol achieves better performance compared to RPC-based cache-coherence protocols. Additionally, YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks indicate that applications over SELCC can achieve comparable or superior performance against competitors over disaggregated memory.</description>
