      <title>Omega-categorical limits of betweenness relations and $D$-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore two constructions of oligomorphic Jordan permutation groups preserving a `limit of betweenness relations' and a `limit of $D$-relations', from \cite{bhattmacph2006jordan} and \cite{almazaydeh2021jordan} respectively. Several issues left open in \cite{almazaydeh2021jordan} are resolved. In particular it is shown that the `limit of $D$-relations' is not homogeneous in the given language, but is `homogenizable', that is, there is a homogeneous structure over a finite relational language with the same universe and the same automorphism group. The structure is NIP, but not monadically NIP, its age is not well-quasi-ordered under embeddability, and the growth rate of the sequence enumerating orbits on $k$-sets grows faster than exponentially. The automorphism group is maximal-closed in the symmetric group. Similar results are shown for the construction in \cite{bhattmacph2006jordan}.</description>

      <title>On Ultrapowers and Cohesive Ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the Tukey order, the Galvin property/Cohesive ultrafilters from \cite{Kanamori1978} in terms of ultrapowers. We use this characterization to measure the distance between the Tukey order and other well-known orders of ultrafilters. Secondly, we improve two theorems of Kanamori \cite{Kanamori1978} from the 70's. We then study the point spectrum and the depth spectrum of an ultrafilter, and give a simple answer to Kanamori's question \cite[Question 2]{Kanamori1978} starting from a supercompact cardinal. Finally, we prove some consistency results regarding the depth spectrum of an ultrafilter, starting from the optimal assumption of $o(\kappa)=\kappa^{++}$, using a Woodin-like surgery argument.</description>

      <title>The Galvin-Prikry Theorem in the Weihrauch lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper classifies different fragments of the Galvin-Prikry theorem, an infinite dimensional generalization of Ramsey's theorem, in terms of their uniform computational content (Weihrauch degree). It can be seen as a continuation of arXiv:2003.04245v3, which focused on the Weihrauch classification of functions related to the open (and clopen) Ramsey theorem. We show that functions related to the Galvin-Prikry theorem for Borel sets of rank n are strictly between the (n+1)-th and n-th iterate of the hyperjump operator $\mathsf{HJ}$, which is in turn equivalent to the better known $\widehat{\mathsf{WF}}$, which corresponds to $\Pi^1_1$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$ in the Weihrauch lattice. To establish this classification we obtain the following computability theoretic result: a Turing jump ideal containing homogeneous sets for all $\Delta^0_{n+1}(X)$ sets must also contain the n-th hyperjump of X. We also extend our analysis to the transfinite levels of the Borel hierarchy. We further obtain some results about the reverse mathematics of the lightface fragments of the Galvin-Prikry theorem.</description>

      <title>Further remarks on the dual negation in team logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual or game-theoretical negation $\lnot$ of independence-friendly logic (IF) and dependence logic (D) exhibits an extreme degree of semantic indeterminacy in that for any pair of sentences $\phi$ and $\psi$ of IF/D, if $\phi$ and $\psi$ are incompatible in the sense that they share no models, there is a sentence $\theta$ of IF/D such that $\phi\equiv \theta$ and $\psi\equiv \lnot \theta$ (as shown originally by Burgess in the equivalent context of the prenex fragment of Henkin quantifier logic). We show that by adjusting the notion of incompatibility employed, analogues of this result can be established for a number of modal and propositional team logics, including Aloni's bilateral state-based modal logic, Hawke and Steinert-Threlkeld's semantic expressivist logic for epistemic modals, as well as propositional dependence logic with the dual negation. Together with its converse, a result of this type can be seen as an expressive completeness theorem with respect to the relevant incompatibility notion; we formulate a notion of expressive completeness for pairs of properties to make this precise.</description>

      <title>First-order definability of Darmon points in number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given number field $K$, we give a $\forall\exists\forall$-first order description of affine Darmon points over $\mathbb{P}^1_K$, and show that this can be improved to a $\forall\exists$-definition in a remarkable particular case. Darmon points, which are a geometric generalization of perfect powers, constitute a non-linear set-theoretical filtration between $K$ and its ring of $S$-integers, the latter of which can be defined with universal formulas, as has been progressively proven by Koenigsmann, Park, and Eisentr\"ager &amp; Morrison. We also show that our formulas are uniform with respect to all possible $S$, with a parameter-free uniformity, and we compute the number of quantifiers and a bound for the degree of the defining polynomial.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and disintegration of tracial von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an analog of the disintegration theorem for tracial von Neumann algebras in the setting of elementary equivalence rather than isomorphism, showing that elementary equivalence of two direct integrals implies fiberwise elementary equivalence under mild, and necessary, hypotheses. This verifies a conjecture of Farah and Ghasemi. Our argument uses a continuous analog of ultraproducts where an ultrafilter on a discrete index set is replaced by a character on a commutative von Neumann algebra, which is closely related to Keisler randomizations of metric structures. We extend several essential results on ultraproducts, such as {\L}o\'s's theorem and countable saturation, to this more general setting.</description>

      <title>Bridging Meadows and Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bridge sheaves of rings over a topological space with common meadows (algebraic structures where the inverse for multiplication is a total operation). More specifically, we show that the subclass of pre-meadows with $\mathbf{a}$, coming from the lattice of open sets of a topological space $X$, and presheaves over $X$ are the same structure. Furthermore, we provide a construction that, given a sheaf of rings $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ produces a common meadow as a disjoint union of elements of the form $\mathcal{F}(U)$ indexed over the open subsets of $X$. We also establish a correspondence between the process of going from a presheaf to a sheaf (called sheafification) and the process of going from a pre-meadow with $\mathbf{a}$ to a common meadow.</description>

      <title>The pseudometric topology induced by upper asymptotic density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upper asymptotic density induces a pseudometric on the power set of the natural numbers, with respect to which $P(\mathbb{N})$ is complete. The collection $D$ of sets with asymptotic density is closed in this pseudometric, and closed subsets of $D$ are characterised by a generalisation of an additivity property (AP0).</description>

      <title>Distribution can be Dropped: Reply to Rumfitt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most believe that there are no empirical grounds that make the adoption of quantum logic necessary. Ian Rumfitt has further argued that this adoption is not possible, either, for the proof that distribution fails in quantum mechanics is rule-circular or unsound. I respond to Rumfitt, by showing that neither is the case: rule-circularity disappears when an appropriate semantics is considered, and soundness is restored by slightly modifying standard quantum mechanics. Thus, albeit this is indeed not necessary, it is however possible for a quantum logician to rationally adjudicate against classical logic.</description>

      <title>Quasitoposes as elementary quotient completions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elementary quotient completion of an elementary doctrine in the sense of Lawvere was introduced in previous work by the first and third authors. It generalises the exact completion of a category with finite products and weak equalisers. In this paper we characterise when an elementary quotient completion is a quasi-topos. We obtain as a corollary a complete characterisation of when an elementary quotient completions is an elementary topos. As a byproduct we determine also when the elementary quotient completion of a tripos is equivalent to the doctrine obtained via the tripos-to-topos construction. Our results are reminiscent of other works regarding exact completions and put those under a common scheme: in particular, Carboni and Vitale's characterisation of exact completions in terms of their projective objects, Carboni and Rosolini's characterisation of locally cartesian closed exact completions, also in the revision by Emmenegger, and Menni's characterisation of the exact completions which are elementary toposes.</description>

      <title>Descriptive properties of I2-embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We contribute to the study of generalizations of the Perfect Set Property and the Baire Property to subsets of spaces of higher cardinalities, like the power set $P(\lambda)$ of a singular cardinal $\lambda$ of countable cofinality or products $\prod_{i&lt;\omega}\lambda_i$ for a strictly increasing sequence $\langle\lambda_i ~ \vert ~ i&lt;\omega\rangle$ of cardinals. We consider the question under which large cardinal hypotheses classes of definable subsets of these spaces possess such regularity properties, focusing on rank-into-rank axioms and classes of sets definable by $\Sigma_1$-formulas with parameters from various collections of sets. We prove that $\omega$-many measurable cardinals, while sufficient to prove the Perfect Set Property of all $\Sigma_1$-definable sets with parameters in $V_\lambda\cup\{V_\lambda\}$, are not enough to prove it if there is a cofinal sequence in $\lambda$ in the parameters. For this conclusion, the existence of an I2-embedding is enough, but there are parameters in $V_{\lambda+1}$ for which I2 is still not enough. The situation is similar for the Baire Property: under I2 all sets that are $\Sigma_1$-definable using elements of $V_\lambda$ and a cofinal sequence as parameters have the Baire property, but I2 is not enough for some parameter in $V_{\lambda+1}$. Finally, the existence of an I0-embedding implies that all sets that are $\Sigma^1_n$-definable with parameters in $V_{\lambda+1}$ have the Baire property.</description>

      <title>More on yet another ideal version of the bounding number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the paper [J. Symb. Log. 87 (2022), 1065--1092]. For an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ we denote $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{I}}=\{f\in\omega^\omega: f^{-1}[\{n\}]\in\mathcal{I} \text{ for every $n\in \omega$}\}$ and write $f\leq_{\mathcal{I}} g$ if $\{n\in\omega:f(n)&gt;g(n)\}\in\mathcal{I}$, where $f,g\in\omega^\omega$.
  We study the cardinal numbers $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))$ describing the smallest sizes of subsets of $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{I}}$ that are unbounded from below with respect to $\leq_{\mathcal{I}}$.
  In particular, we examine the relationships of $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))$ with the dominating number $\mathfrak{d}$. We show that, consistently, $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))&gt;\mathfrak{d}$ for some ideal $\mathcal{I}$, however $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))\leq\mathfrak{d}$ for all analytic ideals $\mathcal{I}$. Moreover, we give example of a Borel ideal with $\mathfrak{b}(\geq_{\mathcal{I}}\cap (\cD_{\mathcal{I}} \times \cD_{\mathcal{I}}))=add(\mathcal{M})$.</description>

      <title>On the significance of parameters and the projective level in the Choice and Comprehension axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20098v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of generalized iterations of Jensen forcing to define a cardinal-preserving generic model of ZF for any $n\ge 1$ and each of the following four Choice hypotheses:
  (1) $\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_n)\land\neg\text{AC}_\omega(\varPi^1_{n+1})\,;$
  (2) $\text{AC}_\omega(\text{OD})\land\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1})\land \neg\text{AC}_\omega(\mathbf\Pi^1_{n+1});$
  (3) $\text{AC}_\omega\land\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_n)\land\neg\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1});$
  (4) $\text{AC}_\omega\land\text{DC}(\varPi^1_{n+1})\land\neg\text{DC}(\mathbf\Pi^1_{n+1}).$
  Thus if ZF is consistent and $n\ge1$ then each of these four conjunctions (1)--(4) is consistent with ZF.
  As for the second main result, let PA$^0_2$ be the 2nd-order Peano arithmetic without the Comprehension schema $\text{CA}$. For any $n\ge1$, we define a cardinal-preserving generic model of ZF, and a set $M\subseteq\mathcal P(\omega)$ in this model, such that $\langle\omega, M\rangle$ satisfies
  (5) PA$^0_2$ + $\text{AC}_\omega(\varSigma^1_{\infty})$ + $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$ + $\neg\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$.
  Thus $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+1})$ does not imply $\text{CA}(\mathbf\Sigma^1_{n+2})$ in PA$^0_2$ even in the presence of the full parameter-free (countable) Choice $\text{AC}_\omega(\varSigma^1_{\infty}).$</description>

      <title>A classification of bisimilarities for general Markov decision processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a fine classification of bisimilarities between states of possibly different labelled Markov processes (LMP). We show that a bisimilarity relation proposed by Panangaden that uses direct sums coincides with "event bisimilarity" from his joint work with Danos, Desharnais, and Laviolette. We also extend Giorgio Bacci's notions of bisimilarity between two different processes to the case of nondeterministic LMP and generalize the game characterization of state bisimilarity by Clerc et al. for the latter.</description>
