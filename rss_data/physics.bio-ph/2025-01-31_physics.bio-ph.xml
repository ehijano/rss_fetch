      <title>A multi-physics approach to probing plant responses: From calcium signaling to thigmonastic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants respond to biotic and abiotic stresses through complex and dynamic mechanisms that integrate physical, chemical, and biological cues. Here, we present a multi-physics platform designed to systematically investigate these responses across scales. The platform combines a six-axis micromanipulator with interchangeable probes to deliver precise mechanical, electrostatic, optical, and chemical stimuli. Using this system, we explore calcium signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana, thigmonastic motion in Mimosa pudica, and chemical exchange via microinjection in Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Ocimum basilicum. Our findings highlight stimulus-specific and spatially dependent responses: mechanical and electrostatic stimuli elicit distinct calcium signaling patterns, while repeated electrostatic stimulation exhibited evidence of response fatigue. Thigmonastic responses in Mimosa pudica depend on the location of perturbation, highlighting the intricate bi-directional calcium signaling. Microinjection experiments successfully demonstrate targeted chemical perturbations in glandular trichomes, opening avenues for biochemical studies. This open-source platform provides a versatile tool for dissecting plant stress responses, bridging the gap between fundamental research and applied technologies in agriculture and bioengineering. By enabling precise, scalable, and reproducible studies of plant-environment interactions, this work offers new insights into the mechanisms underlying plant resilience and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Simulating Curved Lipid Membranes Using Anchored Frozen Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipid bilayers often form high-curvature configurations due to self-assembly conditions or certain biological processes. However, particle-based simulations of lipid membranes are predominantly of flat lipid membranes because planar membranes are easily connected over periodic boundary conditions. To simulate a curved lipid membrane, one can simulate an entire vesicle, a cylinder, or a bicelle (disk-like bilayer aggregate). One can also use artificial methods to control curvature, such as applying virtual walls of beads, radial harmonic potentials, or ``tape up the edges''. These existing methods have limitations due to the method by which curvature is imposed. Herein, we propose an alternative method of introducing arbitrary curvature by anchoring a curved lipid membrane with ``frozen'' equilibrated membrane patches. The method presented here is compatible with all particle-based lipid models and easily extended to many geometries. As an example, we simulate curved membranes with DPPC, DOPC, DLPC and DOPE lipids as parameterized by the Martini3 coarse-grained model. This method introduces limited finite-size artifacts, prevents lipid flip-flop at membrane edges, and allows fluctuations of the free membrane center. We provide verification of the method on flat membranes and discussion on extracting shape and per-leaflet quantities (thickness, order parameter) from curved membranes. Curvature produces asymmetric changes in lipid leaflet properties. Finally, we explore the coupled effect of curvature and membrane asymmetry in both number and lipid type. We report the resulting unique morphologies (inducing gel phase, faceting) and behaviors (thickness dependent on adjacent leaflet type) that are accessible with this method.</description>

      <title>Influence of High-Performance Image-to-Image Translation Networks on Clinical Visual Assessment and Outcome Prediction: Utilizing Ultrasound to MRI Translation in Prostate Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study examines the core traits of image-to-image translation (I2I) networks, focusing on their effectiveness and adaptability in everyday clinical settings. Methods: We have analyzed data from 794 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), using ten prominent 2D/3D I2I networks to convert ultrasound (US) images into MRI scans. We also introduced a new analysis of Radiomic features (RF) via the Spearman correlation coefficient to explore whether networks with high performance (SSIM&gt;85%) could detect subtle RFs. Our study further examined synthetic images by 7 invited physicians. As a final evaluation study, we have investigated the improvement that are achieved using the synthetic MRI data on two traditional machine learning and one deep learning method. Results: In quantitative assessment, 2D-Pix2Pix network substantially outperformed the other 7 networks, with an average SSIM~0.855. The RF analysis revealed that 76 out of 186 RFs were identified using the 2D-Pix2Pix algorithm alone, although half of the RFs were lost during the translation process. A detailed qualitative review by 7 medical doctors noted a deficiency in low-level feature recognition in I2I tasks. Furthermore, the study found that synthesized image-based classification outperformed US image-based classification with an average accuracy and AUC~0.93. Conclusion: This study showed that while 2D-Pix2Pix outperformed cutting-edge networks in low-level feature discovery and overall error and similarity metrics, it still requires improvement in low-level feature performance, as highlighted by Group 3. Further, the study found using synthetic image-based classification outperformed original US image-based methods.</description>

      <title>Scattering approach to diffusion quantifies axonal damage in brain injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis and noninvasive monitoring of neurological disorders require sensitivity to elusive cellular-level alterations that occur much earlier than volumetric changes observable with the millimeter-resolution of medical imaging modalities. Morphological changes in axons, such as axonal varicosities or beadings, are observed in neurological disorders, as well as in development and aging. Here, we reveal the sensitivity of time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) to axonal morphology at the micrometer scale. Scattering theory uncovers the two parameters that determine the diffusive dynamics of water in axons: the average reciprocal cross-section and the variance of long-range cross-sectional fluctuations. This theoretical development allowed us to predict dMRI metrics sensitive to axonal alterations across tens of thousands of axons in seconds rather than months of simulations in a rat model of traumatic brain injury. Our approach bridges the gap between micrometers and millimeters in resolution, offering quantitative, objective biomarkers applicable to a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Curvature-sensing and generation of membrane proteins: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membrane proteins are crucial in regulating biomembrane shapes and controlling the dynamic changes in membrane morphology during essential cellular processes. These proteins can localize to regions with their preferred curvatures (curvature sensing) and induce localized membrane curvature. Thus, this review describes the recent theoretical development in membrane remodeling performed by membrane proteins. The mean-field theories of protein binding and the resulting membrane deformations are reviewed. The effects of hydrophobic insertions on the area-difference elasticity energy and that of intrinsically disordered protein domains on the membrane bending energy are discussed. For the crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins, anisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent excluded volume significantly contribute to curvature sensing and generation. Moreover, simulation studies of membrane deformations caused by protein binding and colloidal particle adhesion are reviewed, including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this methods article, we provide a flexible but easy-to-use implementation of Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) based on Boltzmann machine learning, together with a tutorial on how to use it. The package \texttt{adabmDCA 2.0} is available in different programming languages (C++, Julia, Python) usable on different architectures (single-core and multi-core CPU, GPU) using a common front-end interface. In addition to several learning protocols for dense and sparse generative DCA models, it allows to directly address common downstream tasks like residue-residue contact prediction, mutational-effect prediction, scoring of sequence libraries and generation of artificial sequences for sequence design. It is readily applicable to protein and RNA sequence data.</description>

      <title>Active Loop Extrusion guides DNA-Protein Condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial organization of DNA involves DNA loop extrusion and the formation of protein-DNA condensates. While the significance of each process is increasingly recognized, their interplay remains unexplored. Using molecular dynamics simulation and theory we investigate this interplay. Our findings reveal that loop extrusion can enhance the dynamics of condensation and promotes coalescence and ripening of condensates. Further, the DNA loop enables condensate formation under DNA tension and position condensates. The concurrent presence of loop extrusion and condensate formation results in the formation of distinct domains similar to TADs, an outcome not achieved by either process alone.</description>

      <title>Integrating experimental data with molecular simulations to investigate RNA structural dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformational dynamics is crucial for ribonucleic acid (RNA) function. Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, cryo-electron microscopy, small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, chemical probing, single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer or even thermal or mechanical denaturation experiments probe RNA dynamics at different time and space resolutions. Their combination with accurate atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations paves the way for quantitative and detailed studies of RNA dynamics. First, experiments provide a quantitative validation tool for MD simulations. Second, available data can be used to refine simulated structural ensembles to match experiments. Finally, comparison with experiments allows for improving MD force fields that are transferable to new systems for which data is not available. Here we review the recent literature and provide our perspective on this field.</description>

      <title>Molecular mechanism of Abeta alloform co-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing kinetic experiments on protein aggregation using integrated rate laws has led to numerous advances in our understanding of the fundamental chemical mechanisms behind amyloidogenic disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, biologically relevant processes may be governed by rate equations that are too complex to solve using existing methods, hindering mechanistic insights into these processes. An example of significance is co-aggregation in environments containing multiple Abeta peptide alloforms, which may play a crucial role in the biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease but whose mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we develop using the mathematics of symmetry a highly general integrated rate law valid for most plausible linear self-assembly reactions. We use it in conjunction with experimental data to determine the mechanism of co-aggregation of Abeta42, Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 peptides. We find that Abeta42 fibril surfaces enable the formation of co-oligomers, which accelerate new Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 fibril formation whilst inhibiting secondary nucleation of new Abeta42 fibrils. The simplicity, accuracy and broad applicability of our general solution will encourage its widespread adoption by researchers modelling filamentous self-assembly kinetics, both with and without co-aggregation.</description>

      <title>Perspectives: Comparison of Deep Learning Segmentation Models on Biophysical and Biomedical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning based approaches are now widely used across biophysics to help automate a variety of tasks including image segmentation, feature selection, and deconvolution. However, the presence of multiple competing deep learning architectures, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, makes it challenging to select an architecture best suited for a specific application. As such, we present a comprehensive comparison of common models. Here, we focus on the task of segmentation assuming the typically small training dataset sizes available from biophysics experiments and compare the following four commonly used architectures: convolutional neural networks, U-Nets, vision transformers, and vision state space models. In doing so, we establish criteria for determining optimal conditions under which each model excels, thereby offering practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners in the field.</description>

      <title>Sensitive particle shape dependence of growth-induced mesoscale nematic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directed growth, anisotropic cell shapes, and confinement drive self-organization in multicellular systems. We investigate the influence of particle shape on the distribution and dynamics of nematic microdomains in a minimal in-silico model of proliferating, sterically interacting particles, akin to colonies of rod-shaped bacteria. By introducing continuously tuneable tip variations around a common rod shape with spherical caps, we find that subtle changes significantly impact the emergent dynamics, leading to distinct patterns of microdomain formation and stability. Our analysis reveals separate effects of particle shape and aspect ratio, as well as a transition from exponential to scale-free size distributions, which we recapitulate using an effective master equation model. This allows us to relate differences in microdomain size distributions to different physical mechanisms of microdomain breakup. Our results thereby contribute to the characterization of the effective dynamics in growing aggregates at large and intermediate length scales and the microscopic properties that control it. This could be relevant both for biological self-organization and design strategies for future artificial systems.</description>
