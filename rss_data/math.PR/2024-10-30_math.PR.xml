      <title>On the stability of solutions to random optimization problems under small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Euclidean traveling salesman problem with $n$ random points on the plane. Suppose that one of the points is shifted to a new random location. This gives us a new optimal path. Consider such shifts for each of the $n$ points. Do we get $n$ very different optimal paths? In this article, we show that this is not the case - in fact, the number of truly different paths can be at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ as $n\to \infty$. The proof is based on a general argument which allows us to prove similar stability results in a number of other settings, such as branching random walk, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of mean-field spin glasses, the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses, and the Wigner ensemble of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Density-valued solutions for the Boltzmann-Enskog process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of moderately dense gas evolving in vacuum described by the Boltzmann-Enskog equation is studied. The associated stochastic process, the Boltzmann-Enskog process, was constructed by Albeverio, R\"udiger and Sundar (2017) and further studied by Friesen, R\"udiger and Sundar (2019, 2022). The process is given by the solution of a McKean-Vlasov equation driven by a Poisson random measure, the compensator depending on the distribution of the solution. The existence of a marginal probability density function at each time for the measure-valued solution is established here by using a functional-analytic criterion in Besov spaces Debussche and Romito (2014), and Fournier (2015). In addition to existence, the density is shown to reside in a Besov space. The support of the velocity marginal distribution is shown to be the whole of $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Multiple Radial SLE(0) and Classical Calogero-Sutherland System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the multiple radial SLE(0) systems as the deterministic limit of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems.
  As a consequence of domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we derive that a multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) system is characterized by a conformally covariant partition function satisfying the null vector equations--a second-order PDE system. On the other hand, using the Coulomb gas method inspired by conformal field theory, we construct conformally covariant solutions to the null vector equations, which can be classified according to topological link patterns.
  We construct the multiple radial SLE(0) systems from stationary relations by heuristically taking the classical limit of partition functions as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the growth points and form a radial link pattern.
  The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations.
  For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the fermionic states. In the deterministic case of $\kappa=0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity, form a special class of classical CS systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Twisted multiline queues for the steady states of TASEP and TAZRP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an algorithm on fermionic and bosonic twisted multiline queues that projects to the multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) and the totally asymmetric zero range process (TAZRP) on a ring, respectively. Our algorithm on fermionic multiline queues generalizes the Ferrari-Martin algorithm for TASEP, and we show it is equivalent to the algorithm of Arita-Ayyer-Mallick-Prolhac (2011). Our algorithm on bosonic multiline queues is novel and generalizes the corresponding algorithm of Kuniba-Maruyama-Okado (2016) for the TAZRP. We also define a Markov process on bosonic twisted multiline queues that projects to the TAZRP and intertwines with the symmetric group action on the rows of the multiline queues.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for slow-fast systems with infinite-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the large deviation principle for a family of slow-fast systems perturbed by infinite-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion (FBM) with Hurst parameter $H\in(\frac12,1)$. We adopt the weak convergence method which is based on the variational representation formula for infinite-dimensional mixed FBM. To obtain the weak convergence of the controlled systems, we apply the Khasminskii's averaging principle and the time discretization technique. In addition, we drop the boundedness assumption of the drift coefficient of the slow component and the diffusion coefficient of the fast component.</description>

      <title>Fractal random sets associated with multitype Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a regular tessellation of the Euclidean plane and the sequence of its geometric scalings by negative powers of a fixed integer. We generate iteratively random sets as the union of adjacent tiles from these rescaled tessellations. We encode this geometric construction into a combinatorial object, namely a multitype Galton-Watson tree. Our main result concerns the geometric properties of the limiting planar set. In particular, we show that both box and Hausdorff dimensions coincide and we calculate them in function of the spectral radius of the reproduction matrix associated with this branching process. We then make that spectral radius explicit in several concrete examples when the regular tessellation is either hexagonal, square or triangular.</description>

Abstract: For the stochastic linear transport equation with $L^p$-initial data ($1&lt;p&lt;2$) on the full space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we provide quantitative estimates, in negative Sobolev norms, between its solutions and that of the deterministic heat equation. Similar results are proved for the stochastic 2D Euler equations with transport noise.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of a stochastically modulated infinite server queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinite server queue where the arrival and the service rates are both modulated by a stochastic environment governed by an $S$-valued stochastic process $X$ that is ergodic with a limiting measure $\pi\in \mathcal{P}(S)$. Under certain conditions when $X$ is semi-Markovian and satisfies the renewal regenerative property, long-term behavior of the total counts of people in the queue (denoted by $Y:=(Y_{t}:t\ge 0)$) becomes explicit and the limiting measure of $Y$ can be described through a well-studied affine stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X\stackrel{d}{=}CX+D,\,\, X\perp\!\!\!\perp (C, D)$. We propose a sampling scheme from that limiting measure with explicit convergence diagnostics. Additionally, one example is presented where the stochastic environment makes the system transient, in absence of a `no-feedback' assumption.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limits and non-equilibrium fluctuations for the Symmetric Inclusion Process with long jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a d-dimensional symmetric inclusion process (SIP), where particles are allowed to jump arbitrarily far apart. We establish both the hydrodynamic limit and non-equilibrium fluctuations for the empirical measure of particles. With the help of self-duality and Mosco convergence of Dirichlet forms, we extend structural parallels between exclusion and inclusion dynamics from the short-range scenario to the long-range setting. The hydrodynamic equation for the symmetric inclusion process turns out to be of non-local type. At the level of fluctuations from the hydrodynamic limit, we demonstrate that the density fluctuation field converges to a time-dependent generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose characteristics are again non-local.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein asymptotics for empirical measures of diffusions on four dimensional closed manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the leading term in the asymptotics of the quadratic Wasserstein distance between the invariant measure and empirical measures for diffusion processes on closed weighted four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Unlike results in lower dimensions, our analysis shows that this term depends solely on the Riemannian volume of the manifold, remaining unaffected by the potential and vector field in the diffusion generator.</description>

      <title>A Cram\'er-Wold theorem for mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a Cram\'er-Wold theorem for a family of multivariate probability distributions can be used to generate a similar theorem for mixtures (convex combinations) of distributions drawn from the same family.
  Using this abstract result, we establish a Cram\'er-Wold theorem for mixtures of multivariate Gaussian distributions. According to this theorem, two such mixtures can be distinguished by projecting them onto a certain predetermined finite set of lines, the number of lines depending only on the total number Gaussian distributions involved and on the ambient dimension. A similar result is also obtained for mixtures of multivariate $t$-distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the self-normalized Cram\'er-type moderate deviation of the empirical measure of the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). Consequently, we also derive the Berry-Esseen bound for SGLD. Our approach is by constructing a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to approximate the SGLD and then applying Stein's method as developed in [9,19], to decompose the empirical measure into a martingale difference series sum and a negligible remainder term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increasing popularity of futures trading among financial market participants, the risk management of these instruments is crucial. In this paper, we introduce a model for estimating the ideal time for leaving a trading position on a stock. Also, using ergodic theorems, we investigate the European call option pricing problem using a stochastic irrational rotation on the unit circle. Utilizing the properties of log-ergodic processes, we use the time average of the stochastic process of risky assets instead of expectations in our calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the graphical representations of the Ising model on tree-like graphs. We construct a class of graphs on which the loop $\mathrm{O}(1)$ model and then single random current exhibit a non-unique phase transition with respect to the inverse temperature, highlighting the non-monotonicity of both models. It follows from the construction that there exist infinite graphs $\mathbb{G}\subseteq \mathbb{G}'$ such that the uniform even subgraph of $\mathbb{G}'$ percolates and the uniform even subgraph of $\mathbb{G}$ does not. We also show that on the wired $d$-regular tree, the phase transitions of the loop $\mathrm{O}(1)$, the single random current, and the random-cluster models are all unique and coincide.</description>

      <title>Percolation of thick points of the log-correlated Gaussian field in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the set of thick points of the log-correlated Gaussian field contains an unbounded path in sufficiently high dimensions. This contrasts with the two-dimensional case, where Aru, Papon, and Powell (2023) showed that the set of thick points is totally disconnected. This result has an interesting implication for the exponential metric of the log-correlated Gaussian field: in sufficiently high dimensions, when the parameter $\xi$ is large, the set-to-set distance exponent (if it exists) is negative. This suggests that a new phase may emerge for the exponential metric, which does not appear in two dimensions. In addition, we establish similar results for the set of thick points of the branching random walk. As an intermediate result, we also prove that the critical probability for fractal percolation converges to 0 as $d \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Critical site percolation and cutsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, Kahn conjectured a characterization of the critical percolation probability $p_c$
  in terms of vertex cut sets (\cite{JK03}). Later, Lyons and Peres (2016) conjectured a similar characterization of $p_c$
  , but in terms of edge cut sets (\cite{LP16}). Both conjectures were subsequently proven by Tang (\cite{pt23}) for bond percolation and site percolation on bounded-degree graphs. Tang further conjectured that Kahn's vertex-cut characterization for $p_c^{site}$
  and the Lyons-Peres edge-cut characterization for $p_c^{site}$ would hold for site percolation on any infinite, connected, locally finite graph.
  In this paper, we establish Kahn's vertex-cut characterization for $p_c^{site}$ by adapting arguments from \cite{jmh57a, DCT15}. Additionally, we disprove the Lyons-Peres edge-cut characterization for $p_c^{site}$ by constructing a counterexample.</description>

      <title>On the Connectivity of Friends-and-strangers Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friends-and-strangers graphs, coined by Defant and Kravitz, are denoted by $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are both graphs on $n$ vertices. The graph $X$ represents positions and edges mark adjacent positions while the graph $Y$ represents people and edges mark friendships. The vertex set of $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ consists of all one-to-one placements of people on positions, and there is an edge between any two placements if it is possible to swap two people who are friends and on adjacent positions to get from one placement to the other. Previous papers have studied when $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is connected. In this paper, we consider when $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is $k$-connected where a graph is $k$-connected if it remains connected after removing any $k-1$ or less vertices. We first consider $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ when $Y$ is a complete graph or star graph. We find tight bounds on their connectivity, proving their connectivity equals their minimum degree. We further consider the size of the connected components of $\mathsf{FS}(X,\mathsf{Star}_n)$ where $X$ is connected. We show that asymptotically similar conditions as the conditions mentioned by Bangachev are sufficient for $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ to be $k$-connected. Finally, we consider when $X$ and $Y$ are independent Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs on $n$ vertices and edge probability $p_1$ and $p_2,$ respectively. We show that for $p_0 = n^{-1/2+o(1)},$ if $p_1p_2\geq p_0^2$ and $p_1,$ $p_2 \geq w(n) p_0$ where $w(n) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty,$ then $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is $k$-connected with high probability. This is asymptotically tight as we show that below an asymptotically similar threshold $p_0'=n^{-1/2+o(1)}$, the graph $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is disconnected with high probability if $p_1p_2 \leq (p_0')^2$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sequential directional importance sampling for structural reliability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential directional importance sampling (SDIS) is an efficient adaptive simulation method for estimating failure probabilities. It expresses the failure probability as the product of a group of integrals that are easy to estimate, wherein the first one is estimated with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and all the subsequent ones are estimated with directional importance sampling. In this work, we propose an enhanced SDIS method for structural reliability analysis. We discuss the efficiency of MCS for estimating the first integral in standard SDIS and propose using Subset Simulation as an alternative method. Additionally, we propose a Kriging-based active learning algorithm tailored to identify multiple roots in certain important directions within a specificed search interval. The performance of the enhanced SDIS is demonstrated through various complex benchmark problems. The results show that the enhanced SDIS is a versatile reliability analysis method that can efficiently and robustly solve challenging reliability problems</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Median Based Unit Weibull is a new 2 parameter unit Weibull distribution defined on the unit interval (0,1). Estimation of the parameters using MLE encountered some problems like large variance. Using generalized method of moments (GMMs) and percentile method may ameliorate this condition. This paper introduces GMMs and the percentile methods for estimating the parameters of the new distribution with illustrative real data analysis.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Witten Laplacian associated to a non-Morse potential. We prove Eyring-Kramers formulas for the bottom of the spectrum of this operator in the semiclassical regime and quantify the spectral gap between these eigenvalues and the rest of the spectrum. The main ingredient is the construction of sharp degenerated Gaussian quasimodes through an adaptation of the WKB method.</description>

      <title>Inference of a Susceptible-Infectious stochastic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-inhomogeneous diffusion process able to describe the dynamics of infected people in a susceptible-infectious epidemic model in which the transmission intensity function is time-dependent. Such a model is well suited to describe some classes of micro-parasitic infections in which individuals never acquire lasting immunity and over the course of the epidemic everyone eventually becomes infected. The stochastic process related to the deterministic model is transformable into a non homogeneous Wiener process so the probability distribution can be obtained. Here we focus on the inference for such process, by providing an estimation procedure for the involved parameters. We point out that the time dependence in the infinitesimal moments of the diffusion process makes classical inference methods inapplicable. The proposed procedure is based on Generalized Method of Moments in order to find suitable estimate for the infinitesimal drift and variance of the transformed process. Several simulation studies are conduced to test the procedure, these include the time homogeneous case, for which a comparison with the results obtained by applying the MLE is made, and cases in which the intensity function are time dependent with particular attention to periodic cases. Finally, we apply the estimation procedure to a real dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty, characterised by randomness and stochasticity, is ubiquitous in applications of evolutionary game theory across various fields, including biology, economics and social sciences. The uncertainty may arise from various sources such as fluctuating environments, behavioural errors or incomplete information. Incorporating uncertainty into evolutionary models is essential for enhancing their relevance to real-world problems. In this perspective article, we survey the relevant literature on evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices, with an emphasis on continuous models. We also pose challenging open problems for future research in this important area.</description>

      <title>Robust high-dimensional Gaussian and bootstrap approximations for trimmed sample means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the modern literature on robust mean estimation focuses on designing estimators which obtain optimal sub-Gaussian concentration bounds under minimal moment assumptions and sometimes also assuming contamination. This work looks at robustness in terms of Gaussian and bootstrap approximations, mainly in the regime where the dimension is exponential on the sample size. We show that trimmed sample means attain - under mild moment assumptions and contamination - Gaussian and bootstrap approximation bounds similar to those attained by the empirical mean under light tails. We apply our results to study the Gaussian approximation of VC-subgraph families and also to the problem of vector mean estimation under general norms, improving the bounds currently available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Generalized arcsine laws for a sluggish random walker with subdiffusive growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a simple one dimensional sluggish random walk model with subdiffusive growth. In the continuum hydrodynamic limit, the model corresponds to a particle diffusing on a line with a space dependent diffusion constant D(x)= |x|^{-\alpha} and a drift potential U(x)=|x|^{-\alpha}, where \alpha\geq 0 parametrizes the model. For \alpha=0 it reduces to the standard diffusion, while for \alpha&gt;0 it leads to a slow subdiffusive dynamics with the distance scaling as x\sim t^{\mu} at late times with \mu= 1/(\alpha+2)\leq 1/2. In this paper, we compute exactly, for all \alpha\ge 0, the full probability distributions of three observables for a sluggish walker of duration T starting at the origin: (i) the occupation time t_+ denoting the time spent on the positive side of the origin, (ii) the last passage time t_{\rm l} through the origin before T, and (iii) the time t_M at which the walker is maximally displaced on the positive side of the origin. We show that while for \alpha=0 all three distributions are identical and exhibit the celebrated arcsine laws of L\'evy, they become different from each other for any \alpha&gt;0 and have nontrivial shapes dependent on \alpha. This generalizes the L\'evy's three arcsine laws for normal diffusion (\alpha=0) to the subdiffusive sluggish walker model with a general \alpha\geq 0. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Balanced Bidirectional Breadth-First Search on Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To find a shortest path between two nodes $s_0$ and $s_1$ in a given graph, a classical approach is to start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from $s_0$ and run it until the search discovers $s_1$. Alternatively, one can start two Breadth-First Searches, one from $s_0$ and one from $s_1$, and alternate their layer expansions until they meet. This bidirectional BFS can be balanced by always expanding a layer on the side that has discovered fewer vertices so far. This usually results in significant speedups in real-world networks, and it has been shown that this indeed yields sublinear running time on scale-free graph models such as Chung-Lu graphs and hyperbolic random graphs.
  We improve this layer-balanced bidirectional BFS approach by using a finer balancing technique. Instead of comparing the size of the two BFS trees after each layer expansion, we perform this comparison after each vertex expansion. This gives rise to two algorithms that run faster than the layer-balanced bidirectional BFS on scale-free networks with power-law exponent $\tau \in (2,3)$. The first one is an approximate shortest-path algorithm that outputs a path of length at most 1 longer than the shortest path in time $n^{(\tau-2)/(\tau-1)+o(1)}$. The second one is an exact shortest-path algorithm running in time $n^{1/2+o(1)}$. These runtime bounds hold with high probability when $s_0$ and $s_1$ are chosen uniformly at random among the $n$ vertices of the graph. We also develop an edge-balanced bidirectional BFS algorithm that works under adversarial conditions. This approximate shortest-path algorithm runs in time $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ with high probability when the adversary is allowed to choose $s_0$ and $s_1$ based on their (expected) degree. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on Chung-Lu graphs, Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Directional derivatives and the central limit theorem on compact general one-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will show the central limit theorem for the general one-dimensional lattice where the space of symbols is a compact metric space. We consider the CLT for Lipschitz-Gibbs probabilities and in the proof we use several properties of the Ruelle operator defined on our setting; this will require fixing an {\em a priori probability}. An important issue in the proof of the CLT is the existence of a certain second-order derivative, and this will follow from the analytic properties that will be described in detail throughout the paper. As additional results of independent interest, we will also describe some explicit estimates of the first and second directional derivatives of some dynamical entities like entropy and pressure. For example: given a fixed potential $f$, and a variable observable $\eta$ on the Kernel of the Ruelle operator $\mathcal{L}_f$, we consider the equilibrium probability $\mu_{f + t \,\eta}$ for $f + t \,\eta$. We estimate the values $ \frac{d}{dt} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$ and $ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$, where $h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})$ is the entropy of $ \mu_{C + t \,\eta}$. For fixed $f$ we can find conditions that can indicate the $\eta$ attaining the maximal possible value of $ \frac{d}{dt} h (\mu_{f + t \,\eta})|_{t=0}$ (up to a natural normalization of $\eta)$, entirely in terms of elements on the kernel of $\mathcal{L}_f$. We also consider directional derivatives of the eigenfunction.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the derivation of the mean-field limit for multi-agent systems on a large class of sparse graphs. More specifically, the case of non-exchangeable multi-agent systems consisting of non-identical agents is addressed. The analysis does not only involve PDEs and stochastic analysis but also graph theory through a new concept of limits of sparse graphs (extended graphons) that reflect the structure of the connectivities in the network and has critical effects on the collective dynamics. In this article some of the main restrictive hypothesis in the previous literature on the connectivities between the agents (dense graphs) and the cooperation between them (symmetric interactions) are removed.</description>

Abstract: We consider dynamic boundary conditions involving non-local operators. Our analysis includes a detailed description of such operators together with their relations with random times and random (additive) functionals. We provide some new characterizations for the boundary behaviour of the Brownian motion based on the interplay between non-local operators and boundary value problems. Our main focus is on Feller-Wentzell diffusions. We first consider the instructive case of the real line, then we extend our results on star graphs with trapping points or repulsive vertices.</description>

Abstract: We consider the free additive convolution semigroup $\lbrace \mu^{\boxplus t}:\,t\ge 1\rbrace$ and determine the local behavior of the density of $\mu^{\boxplus t}$ at the endpoints and at any singular point of its support. We then study the free additive convolution of two multi-cut probability measures and show that its density decays either as a square root or as a cubic root at any endpoints of its support. The probability measures considered in this paper satisfy a power law behavior with exponents strictly between $-1$ and $1$ at the endpoints of their supports.</description>

Abstract: We consider the concatenation of $t$ uniformly random perfect matchings on $2n$ vertices, where the operation of concatenation is inspired by the multiplication of generators of the Brauer algebra $\mathfrak{B}_n(\delta)$. For the resulting random string diagram $\mathsf{Br}_n(t)$, we observe a giant component if and only if $n$ is odd, and as $t\to\infty$ we obtain asymptotic results concerning the number of loops, the size of the giant component, and the number of loops of a given shape. Moreover, we give a local description of the giant component. These results mainly rely on the use of renewal theory and the coding of connected components of $\mathsf{Br}_n(t)$ by random vertex-exploration processes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the directed polymer model in the weak disorder phase under the assumption that the partition function is $L^p$-bounded for some $p&gt;1+\frac{2}d$. We prove that the point-to-point partition function can be approximated by two point-to-plane partition functions at the startpoint and endpoint, and in particular that it is $L^p$-bounded as well. Some consequences of this result are also discussed, the most important of which is a local limit theorem for the polymer measure. We furthermore show that the required $L^p$-boundedness holds for some range of $\beta$ beyond the $L^2$-critical point, and in the whole interior of the weak disorder phase for environments with finite support.</description>

      <title>Mallows Product Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-exchangeable ergodic distributions on the infinite symmetric group were classified by Gnedin-Olshanski (2012). In this paper, we study a specific linear combination of the ergodic measures and call it the Mallows product measure. From a particle system perspective, the Mallows product measure is a reversible stationary blocking measure of the infinite-species ASEP and it is a natural multi-species extension of the Bernoulli product blocking measures of the one-species ASEP. Moreover, the Mallows product measure can be viewed as the universal product blocking measure of interacting particle systems coming from random walks on Hecke algebras.
  For the random infinite permutation distributed according to the Mallows product measure we have computed the joint distribution of its neighboring displacements, as well as several other observables. The key feature of the obtained formulas is their remarkably simple product structure. We project these formulas to ASEP with finitely many species, which in particular recovers a recent result of Adams-Balazs-Jay, and also to ASEP(q,M).
  Our main tools are results of Gnedin-Olshanski about ergodic Mallows measures and shift-invariance symmetries of the stochastic colored six vertex model discovered by Borodin-Gorin-Wheeler and Galashin.</description>

      <title>Deterministic computation of quantiles in a Lipschitz framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on computing the quantiles of a random variable $f(X)$, where $X$ is a $[0,1]^d$-valued random variable, $d \in \mathbb{N}^{\ast}$, and $f:[0,1]^d\to \mathbb{R}$ is a deterministic Lipschitz function. We are particularly interested in scenarios where the cost of a single function evaluation is high, while the law of $X$ is assumed to be known. In this context, we propose a deterministic algorithm to compute deterministic lower and upper bounds for the quantile of $f(X)$ at a given level $\alpha \in (0,1)$. With a fixed budget of $N$ function calls, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves an exponential deterministic convergence rate for $d=1$ ($\mathcal{O}( \rho^N)$ with $\rho \in (0,1)$) and a polynomial deterministic convergence rate for $d&gt;1$ ($\mathcal{O}(N^{-\frac{1}{d-1}})$) and show the optimality of those rates. Furthermore, we design two algorithms, depending on whether the Lipschitz constant of $f$ is known or unknown.</description>

      <title>Critical percolation on slabs with random columnar disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a bond percolation model on slabs $\mathbb{S}^+_k=\mathbb{Z}_+\times \mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$ featuring one-dimensional inhomogeneities. In this context, a vertical column on the slab comprises the set of vertical edges projecting to the same vertex on $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$. Columns are chosen based on the arrivals of a renewal process, where the tail distributions of inter-arrival times follow a power law with exponent $\alpha&gt;1$. Inhomogeneities are introduced as follows: vertical edges on selected columns are open (closed) with probability $q$ (respectively $1-q$), independently. Conversely, vertical edges within unselected columns and all horizontal edges are open (closed) with probability $p$ (respectively $1-p$). We prove that for all sufficiently large $\alpha$ (depending solely on $k$), the following assertion holds: if $q&gt;p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$, then $p$ can be taken strictly smaller than $p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$ in a manner that percolation still occurs.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet metric measure spaces: spectrum, irreducibility, and small deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for ultracontractive irreducible Dirichlet metric measure spaces, the Dirichlet spectrum is discrete for a restriction to any connected open set without any assumption on regularity of the boundary. The main applications include small deviations for the corresponding Hunt process and large time asymptotics for the generalized heat content. Our examples include Riemannian and sub-Riemannian manifolds, as well as non-smooth and fractal spaces.</description>

      <title>Stability of a cross-diffusion system and approximation by repulsive random walks: a duality approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider conservative cross-diffusion systems for two species where individual motion rates depend linearly on the local density of the other species. We develop duality estimates and obtain stability and approximation results. We first control the time evolution of the gap between two bounded solutions by means of its initial value. As a by product, we obtain a uniqueness result for bounded solutions valid for any space dimension, under a non-perturbative smallness assumption. Using a discrete counterpart of our duality estimates, we prove the convergence of random walks with local repulsion in one dimensional discrete space to cross-diffusion systems. More precisely, we prove quantitative estimates for the gap between the stochastic process and the cross-diffusion system. We give first rough but general estimates; then we use the duality approach to obtain fine estimates under less general conditions.</description>

      <title>A note on the random triadic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed integer $r\geqslant 3$, let $\mathbb{H}_r(n,p)$ be a random $r$-uniform hypergraph on the vertex set $[n]$, where each $r$-set is an edge randomly and independently with probability $p$. The random $r$-generalized triadic process starts with a complete bipartite graph $K_{r-2,n-r+2}$ on the same vertex set, chooses two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ uniformly at random and iteratively adds $\{x,y\}$ as an edge if there is a subset $Z$ with size $r-2$, denoted as $Z=\{z_1,\cdots,z_{r-2}\}$, such that $\{x,z_i\}$ and $\{y,z_i\}$ for $1\leqslant i\leqslant r-2$ are already edges in the graph and $\{x,y, z_1,\cdots,z_{r-2}\}$ is an edge in $\mathbb{H}_r(n,p)$. The random triadic process is an abbreviation for the random $3$-generalized triadic process. Kor\'{a}ndi et al. proved a sharp threshold probability for the propagation of the random triadic process, that is, if $p= cn^{ - \frac 12}$ for some positive constant $c$, with high probability, the triadic process reaches the complete graph when $c&gt; \frac 12$ and stops at $O(n^{\frac 32})$ edges when $c&lt; \frac 12$. In this note, we consider the final size of the random $r$-generalized triadic process when $p=o( n^{- \frac 12}\log^{ \alpha(3-r)} n)$ with a constant $\alpha&gt; \frac 12$. We show that the generated graph of the process essentially behaves like $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. The final number of added edges in the process, with high probability, equals $ \frac {1}{2}n^{2}p(1\pm o(1))$ provided that $p=\omega(n^{-2})$. The results partially complement the ones on the case of $r=3$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a degenerated Fokker-Planck type differential operator associated to an adaptive Langevin dynamic. We prove Eyring-Kramers formulas for the bottom of the spectrum of this operator in the low temperature regime. The main ingredients are resolvent estimates obtained via hypocoercive techniques and the construction of sharp Gaussian quasimodes through an adaptation of the WKB method.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for the Large Deviations of Selberg's Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\delta&gt;0$ and $\sigma=\frac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\delta}{\log T}$. We prove that, for any $\alpha&gt;0$ and $V\sim \alpha\log \log T$ as $T\to\infty$, $\frac{1}{T}\text{meas}\big\{t\in [T,2T]: \log|\zeta(\sigma+\rm{i} \tau)|&gt;V\big\}\geq C_\alpha(\delta)\int_V^\infty \frac{e^{-y^2/\log\log T}}{\sqrt{\pi\log\log T}} \rm{d} y,$ where $\delta$ is large enough depending on $\alpha$. The result is unconditional on the Riemann hypothesis. As a consequence, we recover the sharp lower bound for the moments on the critical line proved by Heap &amp; Soundararajan and Radziwi{\l}{\l} &amp; Soundararajan. The constant $C_\alpha(\delta)$ is explicit and is compared to the one conjectured by Keating &amp; Snaith for the moments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multilevel Slashing for Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the notion of multilevel slashing, where proof-of-stake blockchain validators can obtain gradual levels of assurance that a certain block is bound to be finalized in a global consensus procedure, unless an increasing and optimally large number of Byzantine processes have their staked assets slashed -- that is, deducted -- due to provably incorrect behavior. Our construction is a highly parameterized generalization of combinatorial intersection systems based on finite projective spaces, with asymptotic high availability and optimal slashing properties. Even under weak conditions, we show that our construction has asymptotically optimal slashing properties with respect to message complexity and validator load; this result also illustrates a fundamental trade off between message complexity, load, and slashing. In addition, we show that any intersection system whose ground elements are disjoint subsets of nodes (e.g. "committees" in committee-based consensus protocols) has asymptotic high availability under similarly weak conditions. Finally, our multilevel construction gives the flexibility to blockchain validators to decide how many "levels" of finalization assurance they wish to obtain. This functionality can be seen either as (i) a form of an early, slashing-based block finalization; or (ii) a service to support reorg tolerance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotent function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``Renyi measure'' for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotent function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are via the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type theorem for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing properties of the white-forced Navier-Stokes system in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^2$. Assuming that the noise is sufficiently non-degenerate, we prove the uniqueness of stationary measure and polynomial mixing in the dual-Lipschitz metric. The proof combines the coupling method with a Foia\c{s}-Prodi type estimate, weighted growth estimates for trajectories, and an estimate for the Leray projector involving Muckenhoupt $A_2$-class weights.</description>
