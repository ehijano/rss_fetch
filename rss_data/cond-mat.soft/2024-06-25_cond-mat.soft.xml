      <title>Anomolous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the mechanism behind the anomalous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions through direct hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations demonstrate that swimmers' orientations near boundary walls predominantly control the overall swimming states and the resultant rheological properties. Hydrodynamic interactions due to specific flow fields characteristic of pullers cause the swimmers to line up vertically, particularly close to the walls where swimmer density peaks, enhancing the polar order of collective motion. Furthermore, the swimming directions near the walls depend significantly on the aspect ratio of the swimmer's body: rod-like swimmers tend to swim toward the flow direction, while swimmers with spherical bodies swim against the flow direction. The present results contrast with our previous simulations of suspensions of pusher-type swimmers, where weak orientation order in bulk regions determines the steady-state properties. Furthermore, these findings highlight that the rheological properties of active suspensions vary widely depending on the swimmers' properties, such as their shapes and swimming mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Identification and classification of clusters of dipolar colloids in an external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloids can acquire a dipolar interaction in the presence of an external electric field. At high field strength, the particles form strings in the field direction. However at weaker field strength, competition with isotropic interactions is expected. One means to investigate this interplay between dipolar and isotropic interactions is to consider clusters of such particles. We have therefore identified, using the GMIN basinhopping tool, a rich library of lowest energy clusters of a dipolar colloidal system where the dipole orientation is fixed with respect to the z-axis, and the dipole strength is varied for m--membered clusters of 7 &lt;= m &lt;=13. In the regime where the isotropic and dipolar interactions are comparable, we find elongated polytetrahedral, octahedral and spiral clusters as well as a set of non--rigid clusters which emerge close to the transition to strings. We further implement a search algorithm which identifies these minimum energy clusters in bulk systems using the topological cluster classification [J. Chem. Phys. 139 234506 (2013)]. We demonstrate this methodology with computer simulations which shows instances of these clusters as a function of dipole strength.</description>

      <title>Brownian friction dynamics: fluctuations in sliding distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the fluctuation (noise) in the position of sliding blocks under constant driving forces on different substrate surfaces. The experimental data are complemented by simulations using a simple spring-block model where the asperity contact regions are modeled by miniblocks connected to the big block by viscoelastic springs. The miniblocks experience forces that fluctuate randomly with the lateral position, simulating the interaction between asperities on the block and the substrate. The theoretical model provides displacement power spectra that agree well with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Micropores can enhance intrinsic fracture energy of hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely known that hydrogels, a class of soft materials made of a polymer chain network, are prone to fatigue failure. To understand the underlying mechanism, here we simulate polymer scission and fatigue initiation in the vicinity of a crack tip in a two-dimensional chain network. For a network without pores, our findings reveal that polymer scission can take place across multiple layers of chains, rather than just a single layer as assumed in the classical Lake-Thomas theory, in consistency with previus studies. For a network with a high density of micropores, our results demonstrate that the pores can substantially enhance the intrinsic fracture energy of the network in direct proportion to the pore size. The underlying mechanism is attributed to pore-pore interactions which lead to a relatively uniform distribution of cohesive energy ahead of the crack tip. Our model suggests that micropores could be a promising strategy for improving the intrinsic fracture energy of hydrogels and that natural porous tissues may have evolved for enhanced fatigue resistance.</description>

      <title>Preparation and observation of jammed particles with power size distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several materials, such as rocks, powders and molecules, are multi-component systems. However, compared to single-component systems, it is difficult to understand the physical component. In this study, as a coarse-grained model for powders with extremely large size variations, we experimentally and numerically filled circular particles with a power size distribution and investigated their structure at the jamming transition point. In the experiment, oil in water droplets following a power size distribution were created, and then we constructed a model with steady injection and fracture to explain the size distribution. In numerical calculations, the dependence of the packing structure on the exponent of the particle size distribution was investigated. The existence of fractal structure with cutoffs was experimentally and numerically found from the structure factor. Numerical calculations show that the area fraction of rattlers is almost independent of exponent, but the number fraction is significantly dependent.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to overheat ice? The activated melting of TIP4P/Ice at solid-vapor coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widely accepted phenomenological rule states that solids with free surfaces cannot be overheated. In this work we discuss this statement critically under the light of the statistical thermodynamics of interfacial roughening transitions. Our results show that the basal face of ice as described by the TIP4P/Ice model can remain mechanically stable for more than one hundred nanoseconds when overheated by 1~K, and for several hundreds of nanoseconds at smaller overheating despite the presence of a significant quasi-liquid layer at the surface. Such time scales, which are often of little experimental significance, can become a concern for the determination of melting points by computer simulations using the direct coexistence method. In the light of this observation, we reinterpret computer simulations of ice premelting and show that current results for the TIP4P/Ice model all imply a scenario of incomplete surface melting. Using a thermodynamic integration path, we reassess our own estimates for the Laplace pressure difference between water and vapor. These calculations are used to measure the disjoining pressure of premelting liquid films and allow us to confirm a minimum of the interfacial free energy at finite premelting thickness of about one nanometer.</description>

      <title>A synthetic T-cell receptor-like protein behaves as a Janus particle in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein engineering enables the creation of tailor-made proteins for an array of applications. ImmTACs stand out as promising therapeutics for cancer and other treatments, while also presenting unique challenges for stability, formulation and delivery. We have shown that ImmTACs behave as Janus particles in solution, leading to self-association at low concentrations, even when the averaged protein-protein interactions suggest that the molecule should be stable. The formation of small but stable oligomers has been confirmed by static and dynamic light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation. Modelling of the structure using Alphafold leads to a rational explanation for this behaviour, consistent with the Janus particle assembly observed for inverse patchy particles.</description>

      <title>Geometrically frustrated, mechanical metamaterial membranes: Large-scale stress accumulation and size-selective assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of geometric frustration on dilational mechanical metamaterial membranes. While shape frustrated elastic plates can only accommodate non-zero Gaussian curvature up to size scales that ultimately vanish with their elastic thickness, we show that frustrated {\it metamembranes} accumulate hyperbolic curvatures up to mesoscopic length scales that are ultimately independent of the size of their microscopic constituents. A continuum elastic theory and discrete numerical model describe the size-dependent shape and internal stresses of axisymmetric, trumpet-like frustrated metamembranes, revealing a non-trivial crossover to a much weaker power-law growth in elastic strain energy with size than in frustrated elastic membranes. We study a consequence of this for the self-limiting assembly thermodynamics of frustrated trumpets, showing a several-fold increase the size range of self-limitation of metamembranes relative to elastic membranes.</description>

      <title>Gradient-enhanced modeling of poro-visco-hyperelasticity-induced time-dependent fracture of blood clots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fracture resistance of blood clots plays a crucial role in physiological hemostasis and pathological thromboembolism. Although recent experimental and computational studies uncovered the poro-viscoelastic property of blood clots and its connection to the time-dependent deformation behavior, the effect of these time-dependent processes on clot fracture and the underlying time-dependent fracture mechanisms are not well understood. This work aims to formulate a thermodynamically consistent, multi-physics theoretical framework for describing the time-dependent deformation and fracture of blood clots. This theory concurrently couples fluid transport through porous fibrin networks, non-linear visco-hyperelastic deformation of the solid skeleton, solid/fluid interactions, mechanical degradation of tissues, gradient enhancement of energy, and protein unfolding of fibrin molecules. The constitutive relations of tissue constituents and the governing equation of fluid transport are derived within the framework of porous media theory by extending non-linear continuum thermodynamics at large strains. A physics-based, compressible network model is developed for the fibrin network of blood clots to describe its mechanical response. An energy-based damage model is developed to predict the damage and fracture of blood clots, and a transient non-local characterization length function is proposed to limit the damage zone bandwidth. The proposed model is experimentally validated using single-edge cracked clot specimens with different constituents. The fracture of blood clots subject to different loading conditions is simulated, and the mechanisms of clot fracture are systematically analyzed. Computational results show that the viscoelasticity and fluid transport play essential roles in the fracture of blood clots under physiological loading.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of ``Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of particles -- arising from the conservation of momentum in the fluid medium -- is examined in the context of the relationship between fluctuations, response functions, and the entropy production rate. The multiplicative nature of the hydrodynamic interactions is shown to introduce subtleties that preclude a straightforward extension of the Harada-Sasa relation. A generalization of the definitions involved in the framework is used to propose a new form of the relation applicable to systems with hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting framework will enable characterization of the non-equilibrium properties of living and active matter systems, which are predominantly in suspensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a computational strategy to quantify the temperature evolution of the timescales and lengthscales over which dynamic facilitation affects the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming liquids at low temperatures, that requires no assumption about the nature of the dynamics. In two glass models, we find that dynamic facilitation depends strongly on temperature, leading to a subdiffusive spreading of relaxation events which we characterize using a temperature-dependent dynamic exponent. We also establish that this temperature evolution represents a major contribution to the increase of the structural relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Predicting heteropolymer interactions: demixing and hypermixing of disordered protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells contain multiple condensates which spontaneously form due to the heterotypic interactions between their components. Although the proteins and disordered region sequences that are responsible for condensate formation have been extensively studied, the rule of interactions between the components that allow demixing, i.e., the coexistence of multiple condensates, is yet to be elucidated. Here we construct an effective theory of the interaction between heteropolymers by fitting it to the molecular dynamics simulation results obtained for more than 200 sequences sampled from the disordered regions of human proteins. We find that the sum of amino acid pair interactions across two heteropolymers predicts the Boyle temperature qualitatively well, which can be quantitatively improved by the dimer pair approximation, where we incorporate the effect of neighboring amino acids in the sequences. The improved theory, combined with the finding of a metric that captures the effective interaction strength between distinct sequences, allowed the selection of up to three disordered region sequences that demix with each other in multicomponent simulations, as well as the generation of artificial sequences that demix with a given sequence.The theory points to a generic sequence design strategy to demix or hypermix thanks to the low dimensional nature of the space of the interactions that we identify. As a consequence of the geometric arguments in the space of interactions, we find that the number of distinct sequences that can demix with each other is strongly constrained, irrespective of the choice of the coarse-grained model. Altogether, we construct a theoretical basis for methods to estimate the effective interaction between heteropolymers, which can be utilized in predicting phase separation properties as well as rules of assignment in the localization and functions of disordered proteins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A paraffin droplet containing camphor and oil red O (dye) floating on the water surface shows spontaneous motion and deformation generated by the surface tension gradient around the droplet. We focused on the intermittent motion with a pronounced deformation into a crescent shape observed at specific concentrations of camphor and oil red O. We quantitatively analyzed the time changes in the droplet deformation and investigated the role of the oil red O by measuring the time-dependent paraffin/water interfacial tension with the pendant drop method. The observed effect can be explained by the active role of the oil red O molecules at the paraffin/water interface. The interfacial tension decreases gradually after the interface formation, allowing for the dynamic deformation of the droplet. The combination of the decrease in interfacial tension and the reduction in driving force related to camphor outflow generates intermittent motion with dynamic deformation into a crescent shape.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition can be understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Antimicrobial Activity of Ionic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bactericidal potency of ionic liquids (ILs) is well-established, yet their precise mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we show evidence that the bactericidal action of ILs primarily involves permeabilizing the bacterial cell membrane. Our findings reveal that ILs exert their effects by directly interacting with the lipid bilayer and enhancing the membrane dynamics. Lateral lipid diffusion is accelerated which in turn augments membrane permeability, ultimately leading to bacterial death. Furthermore, our results establish a significant connection: an increase in the alkyl chain length of ILs correlates with a notable enhancement in both lipid lateral diffusion and antimicrobial potency. This underscores a compelling correlation between membrane dynamics and antimicrobial effectiveness, providing valuable insights for the rational design and optimization of IL-based antimicrobial agents in healthcare applications.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of polydispersity on the properties of curved linear brushes in good solvent and for molten brushes. To this end, we extend the strong stretching theory for polydisperse brushes to curved geometries and investigate the polymer chain end profiles, bending moduli and other properties for experimentally relevant polymer chain length distributions of the Schulz-Zimm type. We also investigate the properties of End Exclusion Zones (EEZ) that may appear in convex geometries under certain conditions, and show that their position in the brush can be engineered by careful selection of the polymer length distribution. Lastly, we propose a method to engineer chain end profiles by engineering the polymer length distribution.</description>

Abstract: Solids are rigid, which means that when left undisturbed, their structures are nearly static. It follows that these structures depend on history -- but it is surprising that they hold readable memories of past events. Here we review the research that has recently flourished around mechanical memory formation, beginning with amorphous solids' various memories of deformation and mesoscopic models based on particle rearrangements. We describe how these concepts apply to a much wider range of solids and glassy matter -- and how they are a bridge to memory and physical computing in mechanical metamaterials. An understanding of memory in all these solids can potentially be the basis for designing or training functionality into materials. Just as important is memory's value for understanding matter whenever it is complex, frustrated, and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Photohermal Microswimmer Penetrate Cell Membrane with Cavitation Bubble</title>

Abstract: Self-propelled micromotors can efficiently convert ambient energy into mechanical motion, which is of great interest for its potential biomedical applications in delivering therapeutics noninvasively. However, navigating these micromotors through biological barriers remains a significant challenge as most micromotors do not provide sufficient disruption forces in in-vivo conditions. In this study, we employed focused scanning laser from conventional confocal microscope to manipulate carbon microbottle based microswimmers. With the increasing of the laser power, the microswimmers' motions translates from autonomous to directional, and finally the high power laser induced the microswimmer explosions, which effectively deliveres microbottle fragments through the cell membrane. It is revealed that photothermally-induced cavitation bubbles enable the propulsion of microbottles in liquids, where the motion direction can be precisely regulated by the scanning orientation of the laser. Furthermore, the membrane penetration ability of the microbottles promised potential applications in drug delivery and cellular injections. As microbottles navigate toward cells, we strategically increase the laser power to trigger their explosion. By loading microswimmers with transfection genes, cytoplasmic transfection can be realized, which is demonstrated by successful gene transfection of GPF in cells. Our findings open new possibilities for cell injection and gene transfection using micromotors.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics with the MARTINI "Lego" approach</title>

Abstract: MARTINI is a popular coarse-grained force-field that is mainly used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is based on the ``Lego'' approach where intermolecular interactions between coarse-grained beads representing chemical units of different polarity are obtained through water--octanol partition coefficients. This enables the simulation of a wide range of molecules by only using a finite number of parametrized coarse-grained beads, similar to the Lego game, where a finite number of bricks are used to create larger structures. Moreover, the MARTINI force-field is based on the Lennard-Jones potential with the shortest possible cutoff including attractions, thus rendering it very efficient for MD simulations. However, MD simulation is in general a computationally expensive method. Here, we demonstrate that using the MARTINI ``Lego'' approach is suitable for many-body dissipative particle (MDPD) dynamics, a method that can simulate multi-component and multi-phase soft matter systems in a much faster time (about 4--7 times) than MD. In this study, a DPPC lipid bilayer is chosen to provide evidence for the validity of this approach and various properties are compared to highlight the potential of the method. Thus, we anticipate that our study opens new possibilities for faster simulations of a wide range of soft matter systems by using the MDPD method.</description>

      <title>Modular DNA origami-based electrochemical detection of DNA and proteins</title>

Abstract: The diversity and heterogeneity of biomarkers has made the development of general methods for single-step quantification of analytes difficult. For individual biomarkers, electrochemical methods that detect a conformational change in an affinity binder upon analyte binding have shown promise. However, because the conformational change must operate within a nanometer-scale working distance, an entirely new sensor, with a unique conformational change, must be developed for each analyte. Here, we demonstrate a modular electrochemical biosensor, built from DNA origami, which is easily adapted to diverse molecules by merely replacing its analyte binding domains. Instead of relying on a unique nanometer-scale movement of a single redox reporter, all sensor variants rely on the same 100-nanometer scale conformational change, which brings dozens of reporters close enough to a gold electrode surface that a signal can be measured via square wave voltammetry, a standard electrochemical technique. To validate our sensor's mechanism, we used single-stranded DNA as an analyte, and optimized the number of redox reporters and various linker lengths. Adaptation of the sensor to streptavidin and PDGF-BB analytes was achieved by simply adding biotin or anti-PDGF aptamers to appropriate DNA linkers. Geometrically-optimized streptavidin sensors exhibited signal gain and limit of detection markedly better than comparable reagentless electrochemical sensors. After use, the same sensors could be regenerated under mild conditions: performance was largely maintained over four cycles of DNA strand displacement and rehybridization. By leveraging the modularity of DNA nanostructures, our work provides a straightforward route to the single-step quantification of arbitrary nucleic acids and proteins.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>

Abstract: Critical phenomena, in which various physical quantities exhibit power laws, have been widely observed in nature and played a central role in physics. They generated the concept of universality class, which origin is elucidated by the renormalization group (RG) theory and which has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk. The entrained air eventually detaches from the disk with or without breakup involving change in topology. While the time development of the interface shape is self-similar with characteristic length scales exhibiting power laws as in the case of non-confined previous studies, we here found that the observed self-similar shape corresponds to a solution to the governing equations, which we show a stable fixed point of the RG flow by combining a RG analysis and the dynamical system description (DSD) developed for singular dynamics in applied mathematics. We thus demonstrate a striking analogy with critical phenomena, showing critical exponents that define a universality class depend on "continuous numbers" characterizing the confinement. This is in contrast with the conventional critical phenomena, in which a class is defined by "discrete numbers." Our results open a new avenue for our understanding of critical phenomena, RG, and DSD, which impacts on the study of singular dynamics widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Localization and bistability of bioconvection in a doubly periodic domain</title>

Abstract: A suspension of swimming microorganisms often generates a large-scale convective pattern known as bioconvection. In contrast to the thermal Rayleigh-Benard system, recent experimental studies report an emergence of steady localized convection patterns and bistability near the onset of instability in bioconvection systems. In this study, to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify the roles of particle self-propulsion in pattern formation, we theoretically and numerically investigate a model bioconvection system in a two-dimensional periodic boundary domain. In doing so, we extend a standard bioconvection model by introducing the equilibrium density profile as an independent parameter, for which the particle self-propulsion is treated as an independent dimensional parameter. Since the large-scale vertical structure dominates in this system, we are able to simplify the model by truncating the higher vertical modes. With this truncated model, we analytically derived the neutrally stable curve and found that the particle motility stabilizes the system. We then numerically analyzed the bifurcation diagram and found the bistable structure at the onset of instability. These findings, localization and bistability, are consistent with experimental observations. We further examined the global structure of the bistable dynamical system and found that the non-trivial unstable steady solution behaves as an edge state that separates the basins of attractors. These results highlight the importance of particle self-propulsion in bioconvection, and more generally our methodology based on the dynamical systems theory is useful in understanding complex flow patterns in nature.</description>
