      <title>Unbiased simulation of Asian options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an extension of the unbiased simulation method for SDEs developed in Henry-Labordere et al. [Ann Appl Probab. 27:6 (2017) 1-37] to a class of path-dependent dynamics, pertaining for Asian options. In our setting, both the payoff and the SDE's coefficients depend on the (weighted) average of the process or, more precisely, on the integral of the solution to the SDE against a continuous function with bounded variations. In particular, this applies to the numerical resolution of the class of path-dependent PDEs whose regularity, in the sens of Dupire, is studied in Bouchard and Tan [Ann. I.H.P., to appear].</description>

      <title>Scaling limit for supercritical nearly unstable Hawkes processes with heavy tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16737v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of {\it supercritical} nearly unstable Hawkes processes with a power law kernel. We find that, the Hawkes process in our context admits a similar equation to that in \cite{MR3563196} for {\it subcritical} case. In particular, the rescaled Hawkes process $(Z^n_{nt}/n^{2\alpha})_{t\in[0,1]}$ converges in law to a kind of integrated fractional Cox Ingersoll Ross process with different coefficients from that in \cite{MR3563196}, as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Portfolio Selection through Preference Aggregation with Quicksort and the Bradley--Terry Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to allocate limited resources to projects that will yield the greatest long-term benefits is a problem that often arises in decision-making under uncertainty. For example, organizations may need to evaluate and select innovation projects with risky returns. Similarly, when allocating resources to research projects, funding agencies are tasked with identifying the most promising proposals based on idiosyncratic criteria. Finally, in participatory budgeting, a local community may need to select a subset of public projects to fund. Regardless of context, agents must estimate the uncertain values of a potentially large number of projects. Developing parsimonious methods to compare these projects, and aggregating agent evaluations so that the overall benefit is maximized, are critical in assembling the best project portfolio. Unlike in standard sorting algorithms, evaluating projects on the basis of uncertain long-term benefits introduces additional complexities. We propose comparison rules based on Quicksort and the Bradley--Terry model, which connects rankings to pairwise "win" probabilities. In our model, each agent determines win probabilities of a pair of projects based on his or her specific evaluation of the projects' long-term benefit. The win probabilities are then appropriately aggregated and used to rank projects. Several of the methods we propose perform better than the two most effective aggregation methods currently available. Additionally, our methods can be combined with sampling techniques to significantly reduce the number of pairwise comparisons. We also discuss how the Bradley--Terry portfolio selection approach can be implemented in practice.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Inference Time Scaling via Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant computational challenges across fields ranging from quantum chemistry to economics and finance. Although scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques offer approximate solutions, they often suffer from bias and neglect crucial physical insights. Inspired by inference-time scaling strategies in language models, we propose Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a physics-informed framework that dynamically refines and debiases the SCiML predictions during inference by enforcing the physical laws. SCaSML leverages derived new physical laws that quantifies systematic errors and employs Monte Carlo solvers based on the Feynman-Kac and Elworthy-Bismut-Li formulas to dynamically correct the prediction. Both numerical and theoretical analysis confirms enhanced convergence rates via compute-optimal inference methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that SCaSML reduces errors by 20-50% compared to the base surrogate model, establishing it as the first algorithm to refine approximated solutions to high-dimensional PDE during inference. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.</description>

      <title>New bounds on the modularity of $G(n,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modularity is a parameter indicating the presence of community structure in the graph. Nowadays it lies at the core of widely used clustering algorithms. We study the modularity of the most classical random graph, binomial $G(n,p)$. In 2020 McDiarmid and Skerman proved, taking advantage of the spectral graph theory and a specific subgraph construction by Coja-Oghlan from 2007, that there exists a constant $b$ such that with high probability the modularity of $G(n,p)$ is at most $b/\sqrt{np}$. The obtained constant $b$ is very big and not easily computable. We improve upon this result showing that a constant under $3$ may be derived here. Interesting is the fact that it might be obtained by basic probabilistic tools. We also address the lower bound on the modularity of $G(n,p)$ and improve the results of McDiarmid and Skerman from 2020 using estimates of bisections of random graphs derived by Dembo, Montanari, and Sen in 2017.</description>

      <title>A new approach for the unitary Dyson Brownian motion through the theory of viscosity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the unitary Dyson Brownian motion through a partial differential equation approach recently introduced for the real Dyson case. The main difference with the real Dyson case is that the spectrum is now on the circle and not on the real line, which leads to particular attention to comparison principles. First we recall why the system of particles which are the eigenvalues of unitary Dyson Brownian motion is well posed thanks to a containment function. Then we proved that the primitive of the limit spectral measure of the unitary Dyson Brownian motion is the unique solution to a viscosity equation obtained by primitive the Dyson equation on the circle. Finally, we study some properties of solutions of Dyson's equation on the circle. We prove a L $\infty$ regularization. We also look at the long time behaviour in law of a solution through a study of the so-called free entropy of the system. We conclude by discussing the uniform convergence towards the uniform measure on the circle of a solution of the Dyson equation.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of (Stochastic) Lagrangian Trajectories for Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories associated with Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. First, we construct solutions to the 3D Euler equations which dissipate kinetic energy with $C_{t,x}^{1/3-}$ regularity, such that the associated Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. The proof is based on the non-uniqueness of positive solutions to the corresponding transport equations, in conjunction with the superposition principle. Second, in dimension $d\geq2$, for any $1&lt;p&lt;2,\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{s}&gt;1+\frac1d$, we construct solutions to the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations in the space $C_tL^p\cap L_t^1W^{1,s}$, demonstrating that the associated (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. Our result is sharp in 2D in the sense that: (1) in the stochastic case, for any vector field $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$, the associated stochastic Lagrangian trajectory associated with $v$ is unique (see \cite{KR05}); (2) in the deterministic case, the LPS condition guarantees that for any weak solution $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$ to the Navier-Stokes equations, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique. Our result is also sharp in dimension $d\geq2$ in the sense that for any divergence-free vector field $v\in L_t^1W^{1,s}$ with $s&gt;d$, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique (see \cite{CC21}).</description>

Abstract: The first goal of this note is to prove the strong well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by L{\'e}vy processes on $\mathbb{R}^d$ having a finite moment of order $\beta \in [1,2]$ and under standard Lipschitz assumptions on the coefficients. Then, we prove a quantitative propagation of chaos result at the level of paths for the associated interacting particle system, with constant diffusion coefficient. Finally, we improve the rates of convergence obtained for linear interactions with respect to the measure and when the noise is a $\alpha$-stable process with $\alpha \in (1,2)$, for which we have $\beta &lt; \alpha$.</description>

Abstract: Let $X(\cdot) $ be a random field $\mathbb{R}^D \to \mathbb{R}^d$, $D\geq d$. We first studied the level set $X^{-1}( u) $, $u \in \mathbb{R}^d$. In particular we gave a weak condition for this level set to be rectifiable. Then, we established a Kac-Rice formula to compute the $D-d$ Hausdorff measure. Our results extend known results, particularly in the non-Gaussian case where we obtained a very general result. We conclude with several extensions and examples of application, including functions of Gaussian random field, zeroes of the likelihood, gravitational microlensing, shot-noise.</description>

      <title>A limit theorem for generalized tempered stable processes and their quadratic variations with stable index tending to two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limit of the joint distribution of a multidimensional Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) process and its quadratic covariation process when the stable index tends to two. Under a proper scaling, the GTS processes converges to a Brownian motion that is a stable process with stable index two. We renormalize their quadratic covariation processes so that they have a nondegenerate limit distribution. We show that the limit is a stable process with stable index one and is independent of the limit Brownian motion of the GTS processes. In addition, we apply this convergence result to finance. By using the scaled GTS process defined above, we construct a pure jump asset price model approaching to the Black-Scholes model. To evaluate how $\alpha$-stable jumps affect the implied volatility, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the at-the-money implied volatility skew when the model approaches to the Black-Scholes model.</description>

Abstract: We analyze hitting times of simple random walk on realizations of the stochastic block model. We show that under some natural assumptions the hitting time averaged over the target vertex asymptotically almost surely given by $N(1+o(1))$. On the other hand, the hitting time averaged over the starting vertex asymptotically almost surely depends on expected degrees in the block the target vertex is in.
  We also show a central limit theorem for the hitting time averaged over the starting vertex. Our main techniques are a spectral decomposition of these hitting times, a spectral analysis of the adjacency matrix and the graph Laplacian.</description>

Abstract: We study long-term behavior and stationary distributions for stochastic heat equations forced simultaneously by a multiplicative noise and an independent additive noise with the same distribution. We prove that nontrivial space-time translation-invariant measures exist for all values of the parameters. We also show that if the multiplicative noise is sufficiently strong, the invariant measure has Cauchy-distributed marginals. Using the same techniques, we prove a similar result on Cauchy-distributed marginals for a logarithmically attenuated version of the problem in two spatial dimensions. The proofs rely on stochastic analysis and elementary potential theory.</description>

      <title>Road layout in the KPZ class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the free, step $2$ Carnot groups of rank $n$ $\mathbb{G}_n$, the subRiemannian Brownian motion consists in a $\mathbb{R}^n$-Brownian motion together with its $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ L{\'e}vy areas. In this article we construct an explicit successful non co-adapted coupling of Brownian motions on $\mathbb{G}_n$. We use this construction to obtain gradient inequalities for the heat semi-group on all the homogeneous step $2$ Carnot groups. Comparing the first coupling time and the first exit time from a domain, we also obtain gradient inequalities for harmonic functions on $\mathbb{G}_n$. These results generalize the coupling strategy by Banerjee, Gordina and Mariano on the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian superposition process model for stochastically describing concentration-discharge relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concentration-discharge relationship is crucial in river hydrology, as it reflects water quality dynamics across both low- and high-flow regimes. However, its mathematical description is still challenging owing to the underlying complex physics and chemistry. This study proposes an infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equation model that effectively describes the concentration-discharge relationship while staying analytically tractable, along with the computational aspects of the model. The proposed model is based on the superposition of the square-root processes (or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes) and its variants, through which both the long-term moments and autocovariance of river discharge and the fluctuation of water quality index can be derived in closed forms. Particularly, the model captures both long (power decay) and short (exponential decay) memories of the fluctuation in a unified manner, while quantifying the hysteresis in the concentration-discharge relationship through mutual covariances with time lags. Based on a verified numerical method, the model is computationally applied to weekly data on total nitrogen (TN. long memory with moderate fluctuation), total phosphorus (TP. short memory with large fluctuation), and total organic carbon (TOC. short memory with moderate fluctuation) from a rural catchment to validate its applicability to real-world datasets. Based on the identified model and its mutual covariance, our findings indicate that, on average, the peak concentrations of these water quality indices appear approximately 1 day after discharge. Finally, the study discusses the effects of model uncertainty on mutual covariance.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is to provide a Master Theorem for some discrete divide and conquer recurrences: $$X_{n}=a_n+\sum_{j=1}^m b_j X_{\lfloor{\frac{n}{m_j}}\rfloor},$$ where the $m_i$'s are integers with $m_i\ge 2$. The main novelty of this work is there is no assumption of regularity or monotonicity for $(a_n)$. Then, this result can be applied to various sequences of random variables $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$, for example such that $\sup_{n\ge 1}\mathbb{E}(|a_n|)&lt;+\infty$.</description>

      <title>Density estimation using cellular binary trees and an application to monotone densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.08006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a density $f$ on $[0,1]$ that must be estimated from an i.i.d. sample $X_1,...,X_n$ drawn from $f$. In this note, we study binary-tree-based histogram estimates that use recursive splitting of intervals. If the decision to split an interval is a (possibly randomized) function of the number of data points in the interval only, then we speak of an estimate of complexity one. We exhibit a universally consistent estimate of complexity one. If the decision to split is a function of the cardinalities of k equal-length sub-intervals, then we speak of an estimate of complexity k. We propose an estimate of complexity two that can estimate any bounded monotone density on $[0,1]$ with optimal expected total variation error $O(n^{-1/3})$.</description>

      <title>Modified Macdonald polynomials and the multispecies zero range process: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous part of this work, we gave a new tableau formula for the modified Macdonald polynomials $\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$, using a weight on tableaux involving the \emph{queue inversion} (quinv) statistic. In this paper we explicitly describe a connection between these combinatorial objects and a class of multispecies totally asymmetric zero range processes (mTAZRP) on a ring, with site-dependent jump-rates. We construct a Markov chain on the space of tableaux of a given shape, which projects to the mTAZRP, and whose stationary distribution can be expressed in terms of quinv-weighted tableaux. We deduce that the mTAZRP has a partition function given by the modified Macdonald polynomial $\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;1,t)$. The novelty here in comparison to previous works relating the stationary distribution of integrable systems to symmetric functions is that the variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are explicitly present as hopping rates in the mTAZRP. We also obtain interesting symmetry properties of the mTAZRP probabilities under permutation of the jump-rates between the sites. Finally, we explore a number of interesting special cases of the mTAZRP, and give explicit formulas for particle densities and correlations of the process purely in terms of modified Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Equipartition Theorems in von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) in information theory establishes that independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) states behave in a way that is similar to uniform states. In particular, with appropriate smoothing, for such states both the min and the max relative entropy asymptotically coincide with the relative entropy. In this paper, we generalize several such equipartition properties to states on general von Neumann algebras.
  First, we show that the smooth max relative entropy of i.i.d. states on a von Neumann algebra has an asymptotic rate given by the quantum relative entropy. In fact, our AEP not only applies to states, but also to quantum channels with appropriate restrictions. In addition, going beyond the i.i.d. assumption, we show that for states that are produced by a sequential process of quantum channels, the smooth max relative entropy can be upper bounded by the sum of appropriate channel relative entropies.
  Our main technical contributions are to extend to the context of general von Neumann algebras a chain rule for quantum channels, as well as an additivity result for the channel relative entropy with a replacer channel.</description>

      <title>Optimal minimax rate of learning nonlocal interaction kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonparametric estimation of nonlocal interaction kernels is crucial in various applications involving interacting particle systems. The inference challenge, situated at the nexus of statistical learning and inverse problems, arises from the nonlocal dependency. A central question is whether the optimal minimax rate of convergence for this problem aligns with the rate of $M^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$ in classical nonparametric regression, where $M$ is the sample size and $\beta$ represents the regularity index of the radial kernel. Our study confirms this alignment for systems with a finite number of particles.
  We introduce a tamed least squares estimator (tLSE) that achieves the optimal convergence rate when $\beta\geq 1/4$ for a broad class of exchangeable distributions by leveraging random matrix theory and Sobolev embedding. The upper minimax rate relies on fourth-moment bounds for normal vectors and nonasymptotic bounds for the left tail probability of the smallest eigenvalue of the normal matrix. The lower minimax rate is derived using the Fano-Tsybakov hypothesis testing method. Our tLSE method offers a straightforward approach for establishing the optimal minimax rate for models with either local or nonlocal dependency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the universality of the large deviations for conjugacy invariant permutations with few cycles. As an application, we establish the universality of large deviation at speeds $n$ and $\sqrt{n}$ for the length of monotone subsequences in conjugacy invariant permutations, with a sharp control over the total number of cycles. This universality class includes the well-known Ewens measures.</description>

      <title>On the expected number of roots of a random Dirichlet polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T&gt;0$ and consider the random Dirichlet polynomial $S_T(t)=Re\, \sum_{n\leq T} X_n n^{-1/2-it}$, where $(X_n)_{n}$ are i.i.d. Gaussian random variables with mean $0$ and variance $1$. We prove that the expected number of roots of $S_T(t)$ in the dyadic interval $[T,2T]$, say $\mathbb{E} N(T)$, is approximately $2/\sqrt{3}$ times the number of zeros of the Riemann $\zeta$ function in the critical strip up to height $T$. Moreover, we also compute the expected number of zeros in the same dyadic interval of the $k$-th derivative of $S_T(t)$. Our proof requires the best upper bounds for the Riemann $\zeta$ function known up to date, and also estimates for the $L^2$ averages of certain Dirichlet polynomials.</description>

      <title>Drift Control with Discretionary Stopping for a Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic control with discretionary stopping for the drift of a diffusion process over an infinite time horizon. The objective is to choose a control process and a stopping time to minimize the expectation of a convex terminal cost in the presence of a fixed operating cost and a control-dependent running cost per unit of elapsed time. Under appropriate conditions on the coefficients of the controlled diffusion, an optimal pair of control and stopping rules is shown to exist. Moreover, under the same assumptions, it is shown that the optimal control is a constant which can be computed fairly explicitly; and that it is optimal to stop the first time an appropriate interval is visited. We consider also a constrained version of the above problem, in which an upper bound on the expectation of available stopping times is imposed; we show that this constrained problem can be reduced to an unconstrained problem with some appropriate change of parameters and, as a result, solved by similar arguments.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Treatment of Open Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open stochastic system \`a la Jan Willems is a system affected by two qualitatively different kinds of uncertainty: one is probabilistic fluctuation, and the other one is nondeterminism caused by a fundamental lack of information. We present a formalization of open stochastic systems in the language of category theory. Central to this is the notion of copartiality which models how the lack of information propagates through a system (corresponding to the coarseness of sigma-algebras in Willems' work). As a concrete example, we study extended Gaussian distributions, which combine Gaussian probability with nondeterminism and correspond precisely to Willems' notion of Gaussian linear systems. We describe them both as measure-theoretic and abstract categorical entities, which enables us to rigorously describe a variety of phenomena like noisy physical laws and uninformative priors in Bayesian statistics. The category of extended Gaussian maps can be seen as a mutual generalization of Gaussian probability and linear relations, which connects the literature on categorical probability with ideas from control theory like signal-flow diagrams.</description>

      <title>Mean-field and fluctuations for hub dynamics in heterogeneous random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a class of heterogeneous random networks, where each node dynamics is a random dynamical system, interacting with neighbor nodes via a random coupling function, we characterize the hub behavior as the mean-field, subject to statistically controlled fluctuations. In particular, we prove that the fluctuations are small over exponentially long time scales and obtain Berry-Esseen estimates for the fluctuation statistics at any fixed time. Our results provide a mathematical explanation for several numerical observations, including the scaling relation between system size and frequency of large fluctuations, as well as system size induced desynchronization. To our best knowledge, these are the first characterizations of mean-field fluctuations on networks with a degree distribution that follows a power-law, a common feature for many realistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate how quantum expanders (i.e. quantum channels with few Kraus operators but a large spectral gap) can be constructed from unitary designs. Concretely, we prove that a random quantum channel whose Kraus operators are independent unitaries sampled from a $2$-design measure is with high probability an optimal expander (in the sense that its spectral gap is as large as possible). More generally, we show that, if these Kraus operators are independent unitaries of the form $U^{\otimes k}$, with $U$ sampled from a $2k$-design measure, then the corresponding random quantum channel is typically an optimal $k$-copy tensor product expander, a concept introduced by Harrow and Hastings (Quant. Inf. Comput. 2009).</description>

      <title>Fast Mixing of Data Augmentation Algorithms: Bayesian Probit, Logit, and Lasso Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of the data augmentation (DA) algorithm, the theoretical understanding of its convergence behavior remains incomplete. We prove the first non-asymptotic polynomial upper bounds on mixing times of three important DA algorithms: DA algorithm for Bayesian Probit regression (Albert and Chib, 1993, ProbitDA), Bayesian Logit regression (Polson, Scott, and Windle, 2013, LogitDA), and Bayesian Lasso regression (Park and Casella, 2008, Rajaratnam et al., 2015, LassoDA). Concretely, we demonstrate that with $\eta$-warm start, parameter dimension $d$, and sample size $n$, the ProbitDA and LogitDA require $\mathcal{O}\left(nd\log \left(\frac{\log \eta}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ steps to obtain samples with at most $\epsilon$ TV error, whereas the LassoDA requires $\mathcal{O}\left(d^2(d\log d +n \log n)^2 \log \left(\frac{\eta}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ steps. The results are generally applicable to settings with large $n$ and large $d$, including settings with highly imbalanced response data in the Probit and Logit regression. The proofs are based on the Markov chain conductance and isoperimetric inequalities. Assuming that data are independently generated from either a bounded, sub-Gaussian, or log-concave distribution, we improve the guarantees for ProbitDA and LogitDA to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n+d)$ with high probability, and compare it with the best known guarantees of Langevin Monte Carlo and Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm. We also discuss the mixing times of the three algorithms under feasible initialization.</description>

      <title>Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.</description>
