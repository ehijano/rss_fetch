      <title>Pulsar timing arrays within rotating and expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00383v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the four pulsar timing arrays were interpreted as a signal of the low frequency stochastic gravitational wave background. We show that the amplitude and angular correlations of pulsar timing residuals can be interpreted as a consequence of the vortical geodetic motions of pulsar's photons within rotating and expanding Universe. The resulting angular correlation curves are similar to the Hellings-Downs curve and the observed amplitude allows the estimate of the vorticity of the Universe. We show that the estimated vorticity is compatible with the observed rotation of the CMB polarization vector.</description>

      <title>A Model of Realistic Flavor Symmetry: Origin of Fermion Mass, Flavor Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I proposed a unified model of particle physic and cosmology in \cite {1}, which can simultaneously account for these origin of the inflation, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino mass and baryon asymmetry. I here focus on the fermion flavor issues in the unified model, which were not addressed previously. I introduce a realistic flavor symmetry to generate the fermion mass and mixing, from which we naturally derive the relationship between the quark mixing and the lepton mixing, and reveal the source of the difference between them. In particular, I derive a neutrino mass matrix which has a special structure form and only contains four parameters, but its numerical solutions are exactly accurately fitting to all the measured data of the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton mixing, and finely predict $m_{\nu_{2}}=0.01037$ eV. In addition, I discuss a new scenario of the leptogenesis in the model, which arises from two CP-asymmetric decays of a super-heavy neutral Dirac fermion, its CP asymmetry is closely related to the neutrino mass and mixing, via which we can correctly predict the baryon asymmetry. Lastly, I give several approaches to test the model. In short, the model can simply and elegantly account for the fermion flavor issues and the baryon asymmetry, and it has realistic and testable significance, therefore we expect the ongoing and future experiments to test the model.</description>
