      <title>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared protection against drugs. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile environments and spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability thus have significant impacts on AMR, whose maintenance in static environments is generally promoted by migration. Here, we demonstrate that this picture changes dramatically in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. To this end, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation model consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment in the presence of a toxin against which protection can be shared. Cells migrate between neighbouring demes and hence connect them. When the environment varies neither too quickly nor too slowly, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks causing fluctuation-driven local extinctions, a mechanism countered by migration that rescues AMR. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we investigate how migration and environmental variability influence the probability of resistance eradication. We determine the near-optimal conditions for the fluctuation-driven AMR eradication, and show that slow but non-zero migration speeds up the clearance of resistance and can enhance its eradication probability. We discuss our study's impact on laboratory-controlled experiments.</description>

      <title>Symbolic dynamics of joint brain states during dyadic coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13360</link>

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to investigate the brain mechanisms that support coordination of behavior between individuals. Brain states in single individuals defined by the patterns of functional connectivity between brain regions are used to create joint symbolic representations of the evolution of brain states in two or more individuals performing a task together. These symbolic dynamics can be analyzed to reveal aspects of the dynamics of joint brain states that are related to coordination or other interactive behaviors. We apply this approach to simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) data from pairs of subjects engaged in two different modes of finger-tapping coordination tasks (synchronization and syncopation) under different interaction conditions (Uncoupled, Leader-Follower, and Mutual) to explore the neural mechanisms of multi-person motor coordination. Our results reveal that the dyads exhibit mostly the same joint symbols in different interaction conditions - the most important differences are reflected in the symbolic dynamics. Recurrence analysis shows that interaction influences the dwell time in specific joint symbols and the structure of joint symbol sequences (motif length). In synchronization, increasing feedback promotes stability with longer dwell times and motif length. In syncopation, Leader-Follower interactions enhance stability (increase dwell time and motif length), but Mutual feedback dramatically reduces stability. Network analysis reveals distinct topological changes with task and feedback. In synchronization, stronger coupling stabilizes a few states restricting the pattern of flow between states, preserving a core-periphery structure of the joint brain states. In syncopation, a more distributed flow amongst a larger set of joint brain states reduces the dominance of core joint brain states.</description>

      <title>Urban Scaling is hardwired in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of the Science of Cities has unveiled previously undiscovered facets of urban life. Contrary to the expectation of chaotic behaviour influenced solely by cultural and geographic factors, cities globally exhibit universal power-law trends in urban scaling. Leveraging recent advances in mathematical descriptions of urban dynamics, this study investigates the interplay among fundamental allometry, fractal dimension, and the number of close contacts within cities. Through a dynamic exploration of these factors, a causal relationship is established, shedding light on the intricate dynamics that shape urban environments. Remarkably, our analysis suggests that the Big Five personality traits play a pivotal role in determining the fractal aspects of urban life. This research contributes to the understanding of urban scaling and proposes a novel connection between human personality traits and the structural patterns observed in cities, opening avenues for further interdisciplinary exploration.</description>
