      <title>The Magnificent Seven Challenges and Opportunities in Domain-Specific Accelerator Design for Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The end of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling has combined with advances in agile hardware design to foster a golden age of domain-specific acceleration. However, this new frontier of computing opportunities is not without pitfalls. As computer architects approach unfamiliar domains, we have seen common themes emerge in the challenges that can hinder progress in the development of useful acceleration. In this work, we present the Magnificent Seven Challenges in domain-specific accelerator design that can guide adventurous architects to contribute meaningfully to novel application domains. Although these challenges appear across domains ranging from ML to genomics, we examine them through the lens of autonomous systems as a motivating example in this work. To that end, we identify opportunities for the path forward in a successful domain-specific accelerator design from these challenges.</description>

      <title>An FPGA-Based Open-Source Hardware-Software Framework for Side-Channel Security Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attacks based on side-channel analysis (SCA) pose a severe security threat to modern computing platforms, further exacerbated on IoT devices by their pervasiveness and handling of private and critical data. Designing SCA-resistant computing platforms requires a significant additional effort in the early stages of the IoT devices' life cycle, which is severely constrained by strict time-to-market deadlines and tight budgets. This manuscript introduces a hardware-software framework meant for SCA research on FPGA targets. It delivers an IoT-class system-on-chip (SoC) that includes a RISC-V CPU, provides observability and controllability through an ad-hoc debug infrastructure to facilitate SCA attacks and evaluate the platform's security, and streamlines the deployment of SCA countermeasures through dedicated hardware and software features such as a DFS actuator and FreeRTOS support. The open-source release of the framework includes the SoC, the scripts to configure the computing platform, compile a target application, and assess the SCA security, as well as a suite of state-of-the-art SCA attacks and countermeasures. The goal is to foster its adoption and novel developments in the field, empowering designers and researchers to focus on studying SCA countermeasures and attacks while relying on a sound and stable hardware-software platform as the foundation for their research.</description>
