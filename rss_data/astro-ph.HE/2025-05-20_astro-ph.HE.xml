      <title>Flavor Equilibration of Supernova Neutrinos: Exploring the Dynamics of Slow Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos experience collective flavor conversion in extreme astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). One manifestation of collective conversion is slow flavor conversion (SFC), which has recently attracted renewed interest owing to its ubiquity across different regions of the supernova environment. In this study, we systematically examine the evolution of kinematic decoherence in a dense neutrino gas undergoing SFC, considering lepton number asymmetries as large as $30\%$. Our findings show that the neutrino gas asymptotically evolves toward a generic state of coarse-grained flavor equilibration which is constrained by approximate lepton number conservation. The equilibration occurs within a few factors of the inverse vacuum oscillation frequency, $\omega^{-1}$, which corresponds to (anti)neutrinos reaching near flavor equipartition after a few kilometers for typical supernova neutrino energies. Notably, the quasi-steady state of the neutrino number densities can be quantitatively described by the neutrino-antineutrino number density ratio $n_{\bar{\nu}_e}/n_{\nu_e}$ alone. Such a simple estimation opens new opportunities for incorporating SFC into CCSN simulations, particularly in regions where SFC develops on scales much shorter than those of collisions.</description>

      <title>A luminous and hot infrared through X-ray transient at a 5 kpc offset from a dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are searching for hot, constant-color, offset optical flares in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream that are ${&gt;}10''$ from any galaxy in public imaging data from the PanSTARRS survey. Here, we present the first discovery from this search: AT 2024puz, a luminous multiwavelength transient offset by $5\,$kpc from a ${\sim}10^8\,M_\odot$ galaxy at $z=0.356$ with a low-moderate star formation rate. It produced luminous $10^{44.79 \pm 0.04}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ optical/UV emission that evolved on a ${\sim}20\,$day timescale, as well as $10^{44.12\pm0.03}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ X-ray emission with a photon-index $\Gamma=1.7$. No associated radio or millimeter emission was detected. We show that the early-time optical emission is likely powered by reprocessing of high-energy, accretion-powered radiation, with a possible contribution from a shock in a dense circum-transient medium. If the shock is dominant at early-times, the circum-transient medium has a mass ${\sim}0.1-1\,M_\odot$, radius $10^{15}\,$cm, and a density profile shallower than ${\sim}r^{-1}$. A near-infrared excess appears at late-times and is suggestive of reprocessing within a wind or other circum-transient medium. The X-rays are most consistent with a central engine. We suggest that AT 2024puz may be associated with an accretion event onto a $50-10^5\,M_\odot$ BH, where the lower masses are preferred based on the large projected offset from the host galaxy. AT2024puz exhibits properties similar to both luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs), but is intermediate between them in its energetics and evolution timescale. This highlights the need for broader exploration of the landscape of hot optical transients to trace their origins.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxies of PTA Sources: Converting Supermassive BH Binary Parameters into EM Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are approaching the sensitivity required to resolve for the first time gravitational wave (GW) signals from individual supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, the large uncertainty in the localisation of the source will make the identification of its host environment challenging. We show how the posterior probability function of binary parameters inferred by the standard GW analysis can be converted into distributions of apparent magnitudes of the host galaxy in the infrared (IR) and optical bands. We do so for two different scenarios: one in which the host is a regular early-type galaxy (ETG), and one in which the binary resides in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate the binary parameter space PTAs can cover in the near and intermediate future and estimate whether their hosts will be detectable in all-sky electromagnetic surveys. A PTA with a baseline of 20 years and 116 pulsars, resembling the upcoming data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)can detect binaries out to a luminosity distance of 2Gpc (which corresponds to a redshift of $z \approx 0.36$) under the most optimistic scenario for detection, while a PTA with a baseline of 30 years and 200 pulsars can reach out to a maximum distance slightly greater than 3Gpc ($z \approx 0.53$). We find that the host galaxies of all binaries that are detectable by a PTA with a baseline of 20 years are above the threshold for the WISE and SuperCOSMOS, and therefore they are expected to be present in those surveys, if they lie outside the Milky Way plane. 2MASS becomes incomplete for hosts of binary systems more massive than $10^{9.8}$ solar masses located at a luminosity distance from Earth greater than 1 Gpc. The EM surveys become slightly more incomplete when we consider the sensitivity of PTAs with baselines of 25 and 30 years, as PTAs can detect binaries to larger distances.</description>

      <title>SpiderCat: A Catalog of Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SpiderCat, a multi-wavelength catalog of all publicly known compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic field. These systems, colloquially known as "spiders", consist of neutron stars in tight orbits with low-mass companions, which are gradually ablated by the pulsar wind. SpiderCat includes both primary subclasses - redbacks and black widows - distinguished by companion mass, as well as candidates and peculiar systems such as transitional, huntsman and tidarren MSPs. As of this initial release, SpiderCat contains 109 entries: 32 redbacks, 49 black widows, 23 redback candidates, and 5 black widow candidates.
  In this paper, we compile and summarize key parameters for each system, including spin and orbital properties, and multi-wavelength data from radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations. An interactive, publicly accessible web interface (https://astro.phys.ntnu.no/SpiderCAT) enables exploration and visualization of the data.
  The rapid growth of the number of known spiders, accelerated by the Fermi-LAT survey and its ability to identify MSPs in gamma-rays, has opened the door to population-level studies. Utilizing SpiderCat, we analyze trends in spin period, orbital period, companion mass, emission properties, and spatial distribution. SpiderCat serves as a dynamic, multi-wavelength repository for this unique class of binary pulsars, facilitating new discoveries and constraints on pulsar evolution, particle acceleration, and the neutron star equation of state.</description>

      <title>EP241021a: A catastrophic collapse/merger of compact star binary leading to the formation of a remnant millisecond magnetar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) with the Einstein Probe have successfully led to the discovery of some unusual extragalactic optical transients. EP241021a is a newly discovered FXRT that was featured by a significant bump around ten days in both optical and X-ray bands. This timescale and the exceptionally high peak bolometric luminosity up to $\sim \rm 10^{44}erg~s^{-1}$ of the optical bump make it somewhat similar to fast blue optical transients, but still distinctive from them by its relatively red color. We then suggest that the multi-wavelength bump of EP241021a could represent an explosion-type transient, while the underlying power-law decaying component of the optical and X-ray emission as well as the total radio emission are produced by a moderately relativistic jet. By fitting the observed multi-wavelength light curves, it is found that the explosion ejecta that produce the thermal optical emission can have a mass of $\sim0.03~M_{\odot}$, an expanding velocity of $\sim0.25~c$, and an optical opacity of $\sim12~\rm cm^2g^{-1}$, which was continuously powered by a rapidly rotating and highly magnetized neutron star (NS; i.e., a magnetar). In addition to heating the explosion ejecta, the magnetar also provided the dominant contribution to the observed X-ray rebrightening through the non-thermal emission of its wind. These properties suggest that the explosion may result from a catastrophic collapse/merger of a compact star system, which led to the formation of a millisecond magnetar, and the possible progenitor could be an accreting white dwarf (WD) or a binary consisting of double WDs, double NSs, or a WD and an NS.</description>

      <title>Idealized Global Models of Accretion Disks with Strong Toroidal Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of accretion disks with a strong toroidal magnetic field using an equation of state that fixes the gas thermal scale height. The disk forms from the inflow of a rotating magnetized gas cloud with a toroidal magnetic field. We find that the system maintains a moderately strong mean azimuthal field in the midplane, with plasma-$\beta\sim1$, trans-Alfv\'enic fluctuations, and large accretion stresses $\alpha\sim0.1$. The azimuthal field in the disk is continuously escaping along the vertical direction but is also replenished via a local dynamo. The inflowing gas initially forms a strongly magnetized Keplerian disk with $\beta\ll1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. The disk gradually collapses from the inside out over $\sim 50-80$ orbits to form a moderately magnetized disk with $\beta\sim1$ and $\alpha\sim0.1$. Radial advection of azimuthal magnetic field can maintain $\beta\lesssim1$ exterior to the circularization radius but not inside of it. Inclusion of a net initial vertical magnetic field can lead to an even more strongly magnetized disk midplane, consistent with previous work. When the gas thermal scale is not resolved ($\lesssim 4$ cells per thermal scale height), however, the disk remains highly magnetized with $\beta \ll 1 $. We discuss our results in the context of related shearing box simulations and other global disk simulations. The level of angular momentum transport found here is consistent with that inferred observationally in dwarf novae and X-ray transient outbursts, unlike simulations of weakly magnetized accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Formation of a Possible Black-hole Ultracompact X-ray Binary with the Shortest Orbital Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the bulge of M31, the Chandra observations discovered a possible black hole (BH) ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) Seq.1 with an orbital period of 7.7 minutes and a maximum X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}=1.09^{+0.02}_{-0.01}\times10^{38}~ \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ in the $0.5-8$ keV band. The minimum orbital period of the BH UCXBs predicted by the standard magnetic braking (MB) model is longer than 8.3 minutes. In this work, we investigate whether the convection- and rotation-boosted (CARB) MB prescription can account for the formation of a BH UCXB like Seq.1. Our detailed stellar evolution models indicate that the CARB MB law can drive isolated BH-main sequence (MS) binaries to evolve toward BH UCXBs with an orbital period of $7.7~ \rm minutes$, in which a low-mass white dwarf transfers the material onto a BH in a short-term mass transfer episode, producing an X-ray luminosity of $10^{38}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. We also obtain an initial parameter space of BH-MS binaries as the progenitors of Seq.1 in the donor-star masses and orbital periods plane, which can be applied to future population synthesis simulations. If Seq.1 is indeed a BH UCXB, future spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detectors can detect the low-frequency GW signals from this source, and a tidal disruption event will be expected after 0.12 Myr.</description>

      <title>The Composite Spectrum of the Little Red Dots from an Inner Standard Disk and an Outer Gravitationally Unstable Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most mysterious results from observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the detection of numerous, high-redshift, very red, extremely compact, broad-line sources termed ``little red dots'' (LRDs). It is unclear whether the LRDs belong to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or simply a collection of very compact star clusters. We build spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 29 LRDs at $z \approx 3-8.5$ based on JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations. We find that the V-shaped SEDs of these LRDs exhibit a roughly similar break frequency at $\nu_{\rm b}=10^{14.96\pm0.06}$ Hz, which corresponds to $\lambda_{\rm b}=3287_{-424}^{+487} \text{\AA}$ in the rest frame. We propose that this unique SED can be explained by the combination of an inner standard disk and an outer gravitationally unstable accretion disk with Toomre parameter $Q\sim1$. The outer disk has a temperature of $\sim2000-4000$ K for typical AGN parameters, which can well reproduce the near-infrared to optical bump as observed in LRDs. This model can naturally explain the strong infrared to optical emission and the V-shaped SED with a similar break frequency $\simeq 10^{15}$ Hz for LRDs without invoking strong dust extinction or unusual stellar contribution from a host galaxy. Most LRDs stay in sub-Eddington state based on the SED modeling, which are intrinsically weak in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes: WISPs in gamma-ray astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes provide an overview of high-energy astrophysical processes involving axions, axion-like particles (ALPs), and other weakly interacting slim particles (WISPs) focusing on their potential observational signatures in astrophysical environments. After introducing key concepts in high-energy astrophysics, we present the fundamental properties of WISPs, emphasizing their phenomenological implications. Particular attention is given to ALP-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields and the possible decay signatures of ALPs in sources such as active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters, and cosmic-ray accelerators. These effects can lead to distinctive modifications in astrophysical spectra, spatial distributions, and polarization patterns, providing unique probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. We discuss their role in dark matter scenarios and their potential impact on high-energy observations. The lecture series is supplemented by hands-on tutorials, including exercises on axion electrodynamics and an analysis of gamma-ray data from NGC 1275 to search for ALP-photon conversion signatures.</description>

      <title>A rapid black hole spin or emission from the plunging region?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission from within the plunging region of black hole accretion flows has recently been detected in two X-ray binary systems. There is, furthermore, a possible discrepancy between the inferred spins of gravitational wave and electromagnetically detected black holes. Motivated by these two results we demonstrate, using theoretical calculations, numerical simulations and observational data, that the inclusion of emission from within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) results in a black hole with a low spin producing a thermal continuum X-ray spectrum that mimics that produced by a much more rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by a disk with no emission from within the ISCO. We demonstrate this explicitly using the observed X-ray spectrum of a canonical soft-state high mass X-ray binary system M33 X-7. A vanishing ISCO temperature model requires a high spin $a_\bullet = 0.84\pm0.05$, as has been found previously in the literature. However, a disk around a Schwarzschild black hole can equally well (in fact slightly better) describe the data, provided that photons emitted from within the plunging region are included, and the ISCO stress is in line with that seen in numerical simulations of the accretion process. We then present an analysis of two further soft-state X-ray binaries (MAXI J1820+070 and MAXI J0637$-$430) which require the presence of intra-ISCO emission at high statistical significance. These two sources sit on the low-spin moderate-stress part of the degeneracy exhibited by M33 X-7, suggesting that when high quality data are available the high-spin low-stress region of parameter space is ruled out. We discuss how future advances in numerical simulations and data modelling will be essential to determining the spin of X-ray binary black holes which may well be systematically lower than current continuum fitting methods suggest.</description>

      <title>The CHIME/FRB Discovery of the Extremely Active Fast Radio Burst Source FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the thousands of observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), a few sources exhibit exceptionally high burst activity observable by many telescopes across a broad range of radio frequencies. Almost all of these highly active repeaters have been discovered by CHIME/FRB, due to its daily observations of the entire Northern sky as a transit radio telescope. FRB 20240114A is a source discovered and reported by CHIME/FRB to the community in January 2024; given its low declination, even the detection of a few bursts hints at a high burst rate. Following the community announcement of this source as a potentially active repeater, it was extensively followed up by other observatories and has emerged as one of the most prolific FRB repeaters ever observed. This paper presents the five bursts CHIME/FRB observed from FRB 20240114A, with channelized raw voltage data saved for two bursts. We do not observe changes in the DM of the source greater than ~1.3 pc cm$^{-3}$ in our observations over nearly a year baseline. We find an RM of ~ +320 rad m$^{-2}$. We do not find evidence for scattering at the level of &lt; 0.3 ms in the bursts, and we find no evidence for astrophysical scintillation. In our observations of FRB 20240114A, we see a burst rate ~49x higher than the median burst rate of apparent non-repeaters also discovered by CHIME/FRB. Each discovery of highly active FRBs provides a valuable opportunity to investigate whether there is a fundamental difference between repeating and apparently non-repeating sources.</description>

      <title>Polarization Properties of Energetic Pulsars at Meterwavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13359</link>

Abstract: Polarization behaviour shows a transition in the pulsar population, where energetic sources with higher spin-down energy loss, $\dot{E} &gt; 10^{34}$ erg~s$^{-1}$, often have fractional linear polarisation ($L/I$) close to 100\%, while below this range $L/I$ is usually lower than 50\%. The polarisation behaviour has been primarily studied at higher frequencies above 1 GHz, and in this work we explore the single pulse polarisation behaviour in pulsars with $\dot{E} &gt; 5\times10^{33}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ at a lower frequency range of 300-750 MHz. The polarisation behaviour can be divided into two categories, the first with $L/I&gt;$ 70\% where the polarisation position angle (PPA) follows a single track, and a second group with $L/I &lt;$ 70\% and scattered PPA behaviour with or without orthogonal modes. However, there are some single pulses in the first category that also have lower $L/I$ and exhibit the presence of two polarisation modes along orthogonal tracks. The radio emission in pulsars arises due to coherent curvature radiation (CCR) from charge bunches, which develops due to non-linear instabilities in the pulsar plasma forming charge separated envelope solitons. The CCR excites orthogonally polarised X and O modes oriented perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field line planes, that detach in the plasma and propagate independently. The O-mode is seven times stronger than the X-mode but gets damped in the medium. We show that incoherent mixing of the X and O modes with different levels of damping can reproduce the observed polarisation features in the energetic pulsar population.</description>

      <title>The Prospect from the Upcoming CMB Experiment LiteBIRD to Discover Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>On the symmetry energy expansion and the peak value of the bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion is a useful way to parameterize the properties of dense matter near nuclear saturation density, and much work has been done to connect physical quantities like the neutron star radius and the core-crust transition density to the symmetry energy parameters. In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism.</description>

      <title>A magnetic tertiary in the most massive compact triple-star system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The system TIC 470710327 is comprised of three main-sequence OB stars, with an inner compact 1.10 d eclipsing binary and a non-eclipsing tertiary on a 52.04 d orbit. With the tertiary mass of 14.5-16 $M_{\odot}$ and both components in the inner eclipsing binary with individual masses of 6--7 and 5.5-6.3 $M_{\odot}$, it is currently the most massive compact system known. The formation scenario of such a compact triple is uncertain. It has been suggested that `2 + 2' quadruple dynamics can lead to a stellar merger in the initially more massive binary and finally result in a highly magnetised tertiary. Our study confirms the presence of a kG-order magnetic field in the tertiary and the slow rotation typical for massive magnetic stars. We conclude that finding massive merger candidates by studies of dynamics in compact, multiple-star systems is an efficient way to understand the evolution of massive stellar multiplicity and the generation of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Linear analysis of I-C-Love universal relations for neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are excellent laboratories for testing gravity theories as they are strongly self-gravitating bodies and have rich observational phenomena. However, strong-gravity effects in NS could be degenerate with their equation of state (EOS) which is largely unknown. Fortunately, there exist the so-called universal relations among the NS macroscopic quantities that are found to be insensitive to the underlying EOS. Studying the origin of these relations can lead to a better understanding of NSs and the gravitational interaction. We develop a new perspective of view to analyze the I-C and I-Love universal relations for NSs. At the linear order, we separate the deviation of the universal relations into two parts, where one is the EOS perturbation while the other only depends on the background star structures. The smallness of the second part fully determines the universality of the relation irrespective of the form of the first part. We discuss the validity of our linear approximation when considering the difference among realistic EOSs. Our study can be regarded as a new frame for quantitative representation of the universality and may provide new insights to the universal relations of NSs.</description>

      <title>ALMA observation of evolving magnetized corona in the radio-quiet changing-state AGN NGC 1566</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of compact millimeter (mm) continuum emission from radio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs) is still not fully understood. Changing-state AGNs (CSAGNs) display rapid and strong variability, which can allow us to investigate the origin of the mm emission. We present here the results of the first study of the mm continuum variability of a CSAGN using archival ALMA band 6 ($\sim 230$ GHz) observations of NGC 1566 obtained in 2014-2023. We find a positive correlation between the mm and X-ray flux with an intrinsic scatter of 0.05 dex ($1\sigma$), suggesting a common origin. The mm spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm mm}$) is found in the range of $0.13\pm0.38$ to $-0.26\pm0.53$, consistent with a compact optically thick synchrotron source. No significant correlation was found between the $\alpha_{\rm mm}$ and the mm flux. The mm/X-ray ratio also shows no clear link to the Eddington ratio but is higher in the low-accretion state. We discuss several scenarios about the origin of the mm emission in NGC 1566. We find that synchrotron emission in the magnetized X-ray corona appears to be the most probable origin of mm emission, confirming that mm emission can be used as a tracer of AGN activity in RQAGNs.</description>

      <title>Inflight calibration of SRG/ART-XC point spread function at large off-axis angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) of the Mikhail Pavlinsky Astronomical Roentgen Telescope - X-ray Concentrator (ART-XC) telescope aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory plays an especially crucial role in the detection of point X-ray sources in the all-sky survey and the studies of extended X-ray objects with low surface brightness. In this work, we calibrate the far off-axis shape of the ART-XC PSF using in-flight data of Sco X-1 and the Crab Nebula, in all-sky survey or scan mode, respectively. We demonstrate that the so-called "slewing" ART-XC PSF (in contrast to the on-axis PSF), in convolution with the detector pixels, is consistent with ground calibration performed at the Marshall Space Flight Center, and can be used to model the PSF up to large off-axis distances in all-sky survey or scan modes. The radial profile of the Crab Nebula in the 4-12 keV band shows an extended structure out to ~150" and is consistent with Sco X-1 at larger off-axis angles. Finally, we performed an analytic parametrization of the slewing ART-XC PSF as a function of energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Mahakala, a Python-based, modular, radiative ray-tracing code for curved space-times. We employ Google's JAX framework for accelerated automatic differentiation, which can efficiently compute Christoffel symbols directly from the metric, allowing the user to easily and quickly simulate photon trajectories through non-Kerr spacetimes. JAX also enables Mahakala to run in parallel on both CPUs and GPUs. Mahakala natively uses the Cartesian Kerr-Schild coordinate system, which avoids numerical issues caused by the pole in spherical coordinate systems. We demonstrate Mahakala's capabilities by simulating 1.3 mm wavelength images (the wavelength of Event Horizon Telescope observations) of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low-accretion rate supermassive black holes. The modular nature of Mahakala allows us to quantitatively explore how different regions of the flow influence different image features. We show that most of the emission seen in 1.3 mm images originates close to the black hole and peaks near the photon orbit. We also quantify the relative contribution of the disk, forward jet, and counter jet to 1.3 mm images.</description>

      <title>Search for eccentric NSBH and BNS mergers in the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible formation histories of neutron star binaries remain unresolved by current gravitational-wave catalogs. The detection of an eccentric binary system could be vital in constraining compact binary formation models. We present the first search for aligned spin eccentric neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH) and the most sensitive search for aligned-spin eccentric binary neutron star (BNS) systems using data from the third observing run of the advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo detectors. No new statistically significant candidates are found; we constrain the local merger rate for specific astrophysical models to be less than 150 $\text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars in the field, and, 50, 100, and 70 $\text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$ for neutron star-black hole binaries in globular clusters, hierarchical triples and nuclear clusters, respectively, at the 90$\%$ confidence level if we assume that no sources have been observed from these populations. We predict the capabilities of upcoming and next-generation observatory networks; we investigate the ability of three LIGO ($\text{A}^{\#}$) detectors and Cosmic Explorer CE (20km) + CE (40km) to use eccentric binary observations for determining the formation history of neutron star binaries. We find that 2 -- 100 years of observation with three $\text{A}^{\#}$ observatories are required before we observe clearly eccentric NSBH binaries; this reduces to only 10 days -- 1 year with the CE detector network. CE will observe tens to hundreds of measurably eccentric binaries from each of the formation models we consider.</description>

      <title>Back from the dead: AT2019aalc as a candidate repeating TDE in an AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. To date, three nuclear transients have been associated with high-energy neutrino events. These transients are generally thought to be powered by tidal disruptions of stars (TDEs) by massive black holes. However, AT2019aalc, hosted in a Seyfert-1 galaxy, was not yet classified due to a lack of multiwavelength observations. Interestingly, the source has re-brightened 4 years after its discovery. Aims. We aim to classify the transient and explain the mechanism responsible for its second optical flare. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023/2024. Results. The observations revealed a uniquely bright UV counterpart and multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conclusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. The multi-wavelength properties of these transients suggest a possible connection between ECLEs, BFFs and TDEs in AGN.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration in Collisionless Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first collisionless realization of two-dimensional axisymmetric black hole accretion consistent with a persistent magnetically arrested disk state. The accretion flow, consisting of an ion-electron disk plasma combined with magnetospheric pair creation effects, is simulated using first-principles general-relativistic particle-in-cell methods. The simulation is evolved over significant dynamical timescales during which a quasi-steady accretion state is reached with several magnetic flux eruption cycles. We include a realistic treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production, which allows for studying the interaction between the collisionless accretion flow and pair-loaded jet. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux eruptions associated with equatorial magnetic reconnection within the black hole magnetosphere and the formation of spark gaps are locations of maximal particle acceleration. Flux eruptions, starting near the central black hole, can trigger Kelvin-Helmholtz-like vortices at the jet-disk interface that facilitate efficient mixing between disk and jet plasma in this region. Transient periods of increased pair production following magnetic flux eruptions and reconnection events are responsible for most of the highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarization measurement of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary and Z-source, GX 340$+$0, in the normal branch (NB) using a 200 ks observation with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetric Explorer (IXPE). This observation was performed in 2024 August. Along with IXPE, we also conducted simultaneous observations with NICER, AstroSat, Insight-HXMT, ATCA, and GMRT to investigate the broadband spectral and timing properties in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. During the campaign, the source traced a complete Z-track during the IXPE observation but spent most of the time in the NB. We measure X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $1.22\pm0.25\%$ in the 2-8 keV energy band with a polarization angle (PA) of $38\pm6^\circ$. The PD in the NB is observed to be weaker than in the horizontal branch (HB) but aligned in the same direction. The PD of the source exhibits a marginal increase with energy while the PA shows no energy dependence. The joint spectro-polarimetric modeling is consistent with the observed X-ray polarization originating from a single spectral component from the blackbody or the Comptonized emission while the disk emission does not contribute towards the X-ray polarization. GMRT observations at 1.26 GHz during HB had a tentative detection at 4.5$\pm$0.7 mJy while ATCA observations a day later during the NB detected the source at 0.70$\pm$0.05 mJy and 0.59$\pm$0.05 mJy in the 5.5 &amp; 9 GHz bands, respectively, suggesting an evolving jet structure depending on the Z-track position.</description>

      <title>A neutrino flare potentially associated with X-ray emission from tidal disruption event ATLAS17jrp</title>

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs), in which stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes, have been proposed as potential sources of high-energy neutrinos via particle acceleration. Follow-up observations and analyses of IceCube alert events have revealed spatial and temporal associations with several TDEs, exhibiting high X-ray luminosities. We analyzed ten years of IceCube muon-track data (2008-2018) and selected TDEs with X-ray observations during the neutrino dataset period. A time-dependent unbinned likelihood analysis was employed to search for temporally correlated neutrino emission. The statistical significance of potential flares was assessed through randomized simulations. Among the ten X-ray TDEs observed during the analysis period, we identified a potential neutrino flare that is both spatially and temporally coincident with the TDE ATLAS17jrp. The flare exhibited a delay of 19 days relative to the X-ray onset and lasted for 56 days. Its origin may be attributed to hadronic interactions, with X-ray photons serving as target fields. After accounting for the observed temporal correlation with the X-ray emission and the trial factor from the search of ten sources, we obtained a post\text{-}trial $p$\text{-}value of 0.01, suggesting a possible association.</description>

      <title>Pulse Profiles of Accreting Neutron Stars from GRMHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pulsed X-ray emission from the neutron star surface acts as a window to study the state of matter in the neutron star interior. For accreting millisecond pulsars, the surface X-ray emission is generated from the `hotspots' formed due to the magnetically channeled accretion flow hitting the stellar surface. The emission from these hotspots is modulated by stellar rotation giving rise to pulsations. Using global three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of the star-disk system, we investigate the accretion hotspots and the corresponding X-ray pulse properties of accreting millisecond pulsars with dipolar magnetic fields. The accretion spot morphologies in our simulations are entirely determined by the accretion columns and vary as a function of the stellar magnetic inclination. For lower magnetic inclinations, the hotspots are shaped like crescents around the magnetic axis and are transformed into elongated bars for higher inclinations. We model the X-ray pulses resulting from the simulated hotspots using general-relativistic ray tracing calculations and quantify the variability of the pulsed signal. The pulse amplitudes in our simulations usually range between $1 - 12 \%$ rms and are consistent with the observed values. We find that the turbulent accretion flow in the GRMHD simulations introduces significant broadband variability on a timescale similar to the stellar rotational period. We also explore the impact of electron scattering absorption and show that along with being a key factor in determining the pulse characteristics, this also introduces significant additional variability and higher harmonics in the bolometric light curve of the accreting sources.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Luminosity Function and Delay-Time Distribution of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts for Multimessenger Gravitational-Wave Detection Rate Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the most recent short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) sample detected by the \emph{Fermi} satellite to reassess the sGRB luminosity function and formation rate. Using the empirical redshift-luminosity correlation, we first determine the pseudo redshifts of 478 sGRBs. Then, we use the maximum likelihood method to constrain the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs under various delay-time distribution models, finding the Gaussian delay model statistically preferred over the power-law and lognormal delay models based on theDeviance Information Criterion. The local formation rate of sGRBs is $R_{\mathrm{sGRB}}(0)=1.37_{-0.27}^{+0.30}$ $\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, largely independent of the adopted delay-time distribution model. Additionally, we investigate the potential for joint detection of sGRBs and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts from binary neutron star mergers using both current and future GRB and GW facilities. For sGRB detection, we consider three existing satellites: \emph{Fermi}, the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}), and the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}). For GW detection, we examine two International GW Networks (IGWN): a four-detector network consisting of LIGO Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA (IGWN4) and an upcoming five-detector network that includes these four detectors plus LIGO India (IGWN5). Incorporating the angular dependence of sGRB jet emission energy, our results show that for different delay-time distribution models, the joint sGRB and GW detection rates for \emph{Fermi}, \emph{SVOM}, and \emph{EP} with IGWN4 (IGWN5) lie within 0.19--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.93--1.35 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), 0.07--0.10 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.51--0.79 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), and 0.01--0.03 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.15--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), respectively.</description>

      <title>Secondary spins of extreme mass ratio inspirals: A probe to the formation channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a secondary (stellar mass) black hole (BH) orbiting around a supermassive BH, are one of the primary targets for future spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The spin of the secondary BH encodes the formation history of the stellar mass BH and the formation process of the EMRI. In this work, we construct a kludge EMRI waveform model taking the secondary spin into account and preliminarily forecast the measurement precision of the secondary spin by future spaceborne GW detectors with the Fisher information matrix. We find the secondary spin might be measured with reasonably good precision for generic eccentric and inclined EMRIs, with the caveat that the predictive precision may be constrained by the model's inherent simplifications. As an example of its astrophysical applications, we propose that the secondary spin can be used for distinguishing dry (loss cone) EMRIs (where the secondary BHs were born in the collapse of individual massive stars and are of low spin) and Hills EMRIs (where the secondary BHs are remnants of massive star binaries and the secondary spins follow a bimodal distribution).</description>

      <title>Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) I: Survey description, discovery and timing of the first pulsar in NGC 6093 (M80)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes the new Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) survey. This survey aims to find MSPs in the globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way using uGMRT. The observations use the uGMRT's Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) and Band-3 (300$-$500 MHz) receivers, which are well suited for steep-spectral-index radio sources like MSPs; the survey will eventually cover the GCs accessible to the uGMRT sky (i.e. $\delta\:&gt;\:\sim\:-\:53^\circ$), and that is South of $\delta = -17^\circ$ (FAST sky limit) and have not been targeted with the sensitivity of this survey. The observations started in May 2023, having so far resulted in seven new discoveries. In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up study of the first pulsar from this survey, J1617$-$2258A, a 4.32 ms binary MSP that is also the first to be discovered in the globular cluster NGC 6093. We localised this MSP with arc-sec precision from imaging and obtained the unique timing solution from more than one year of timing observations with the Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) receivers of the uGMRT. This revealed an unusual binary MSP, with a $\sim$ 19-hour, highly eccentric (e $\sim$ 0.54) orbit having a low-mass companion. This orbital eccentricity allowed the measurement of the rate of advance of periastron for this system, which led to the derivation of its total mass, $1.67 \, \pm \, 0.06 \, \rm M_{\odot}$; this together with the system's mass function implies, for the pulsar and the companion, $M_\mathrm{p} &lt; 1.60 \, \rm M_{\odot}$ and $M_\mathrm{c} &gt; 0.072 \, \rm M_{\odot}$. The system is likely a perturbed MSP-Helium WD system seen at a low orbital inclination.</description>

      <title>A strike of luck: could the KM3-230213A event be caused by an evaporating primordial black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the "memory burden", may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT's current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.</description>

      <title>An Unusual Change in the Radio Jets of GRS 1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare Very Large Array observations of GRS 1915+105 made in 1994 and 2023, with nearly three decades of difference. The source has experienced intriguing major changes. The position angle of the bipolar ejecta in the plane of the sky has increased counterclockwise by 24$^\circ$. The inclination angle of the flow with respect to the line of sight has increased by 17$^\circ$. Both sets of observations show the temporal quasi-sinusoidal radio oscillations previously reported for other epochs. However, the 2023 oscillations are faster than ever before, with a period of about 8 minutes as opposed to the periods in the range of 20 to 40 minutes observed in previous epochs. Analysis of GRS 1915+105 images over the years suggest that the observed changes took place within a year or less. Our analysis indicates that during 2023 the plane of the accretion disk was aligned with the line of sight, which may explain the deep X-ray obscured state and the high mid-infrared luminosity observed with JWST in that epoch. More recent 2024 observations show that the position angle of the ejecta has returned to its historic values. Future monitoring of the time evolution of the source may clarify the cause of these remarkable changes.</description>

      <title>A discussion on the origin of the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment and the total Galactic gamma-ray flux measured by Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) are found to be consistent, within the statistical and systematic uncertainties, for the inner Galactic Plane region in the sub-PeV energy range (E &gt; $10^{14}$ eV). The result suggests that the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray flux is dominated by the diffuse emission. On the other hand, the LHAASO observations suggest that the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources presented in the first LHAASO catalog possibly give a significant contribution to the total sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission ($\approx$ 60%). However, the estimate must be regarded as a conservative upper limit in the sub-PeV energy range. In fact, current gamma-ray observations imply that many of the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources detected by LHAASO have a cutoff or significant softening in their energy spectra in the several tens of TeV energy range, and the resolved-source contribution to the total sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission should be much lower than the above estimate. More sophisticated discussion about the origin of the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission requires detailed spectral studies of the individual gamma-ray sources and an accurate estimate of the contamination of the source fluxes from the diffuse emission.</description>

      <title>Repeated Tidal Interactions between Stars and Supermassive Black Holes: Mass Transfer, Stability, and Implications for Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars orbiting supermassive black holes can generate recurring accretion flares in repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we develop an efficient formalism for analyzing the time-dependent response of a star to the removal of a fraction ($\lesssim 10\%$) of its mass. This model predicts that mass loss results in a decrease in the average density of low-mass ($\lesssim 0.7 M_{\odot}$) stars. Contrarily, higher-mass stars exhibit an increase in their average density, such that the change is more pronounced for larger mass losses, and stars with masses $\sim 1.5-2 M_{\odot}$ experience the largest such increase. We predict that the final energy of the star post-mass-loss (i.e., the ``surviving core'') is effectively given by the binding energy of the original star interior to the radius from which mass is removed, i.e., the final core energy is agnostic to the process that removes the mass and -- as a corollary -- tidal heating is comparatively insignificant. We find excellent agreement between our predictions and one-dimensional Eulerian simulations of a star undergoing mass loss, and three-dimensional Lagrangian simulations of partial TDEs. We conclude that 1) partially disrupted stars are not significantly heated via tidal dissipation, 2) evolved and moderately massive ($\gtrsim 1.5 M_{\odot}$) stars can most readily survive many repeated stripping events, and 3) progressively dimmer flares -- observed in some repeating partial TDE candidates -- could be explained by the increase in the density of the star post-mass-loss.</description>

Abstract: We report the first X-ray polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Z-source GX 349+2 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We discovered that the X-ray source was polarized at PD = 1.1 +/- 0.3% (1-sigma errors) with a polarization angle of PA = 32 +/- 6 degree (1-sigma errors). Simultaneous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations show that the source transitioned through the normal branch (NB), flaring branch (FB), and soft apex (SA) of the Z-track during our IXPE observations. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component, a blackbody representing the emission from the NS surface, and a Comptonized component. We discuss the accretion geometry of the Z source in light of the spectro-polarimetric results.</description>

      <title>Polarization Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Simulated Tilted, Truncated Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the Monte-Carlo radiation transport code, Pandurata, to create images, spectra, polarization maps, and light curves from a set of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted, truncated, black hole accretion disks. Truncation can have spectral and polarization signatures all its own; tilt introduces both inclination and azimuthal dependencies into the spectra and polarization; and precession and oscillations of the tilted accretion flow inside the truncation radius (what we posit to be the "corona") introduce time dependencies or periodicity to all of this. We use the ray-traced results from our simulations to evaluate the feasibility of measuring these effects, particularly in the context of current and future X-ray polarization observatories. Such detections could greatly improve our understanding of the geometry of accretion disks and coronae in the hard state, the physics of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), and how system properties evolve as sources approach the hard-to-soft state transition.</description>

      <title>Weighing The Options: The Unseen Companion in LAMOST J2354 is Likely a Massive White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LAMOST J235456.73+335625 (J2354) is a binary system hosting a $\sim 0.7~\rm M_\odot$ K dwarf and a $\sim 1.4~\rm M_\odot$ dark companion, supposedly a neutron star, in a 0.48d orbit. Here we present high- and low-resolution spectroscopy to better constrain the properties of the system. The low-resolution spectrum confirms that the luminous star is a slightly metal-poor K dwarf and strengthens the limits on any optical flux from the dimmer companion. We use the high-resolution spectra to measure atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_{\rm rot}\sin i$) and abundances for 8 elements for the K dwarf. We refine the mass of the compact object to $M_{\rm co} \sim 1.3~\rm M_\odot$ with a minimum mass of $M_{\rm co, min} = 1.23\pm0.04~\rm M_\odot$. The expected overabundance of intermediate-mass elements from the incident supernova ejecta is not detected in the K-dwarf atmosphere. This contrasts with known binaries hosting neutron stars where almost all companions show evidence for polluting material. Moving the neutron-star progenitor further from the K-dwarf at the time of explosion to minimize atmospheric pollution requires a finely-tuned kick to produce the current orbital separation of $\sim 3.3~\rm R_\odot$. Instead, we find that a massive white dwarf with a cooling age of $\gtrsim 3~$Gyr satisfies all observational constraints. The system likely experienced two common-envelope phases leading to its current state because the white dwarf progenitor was massive enough to ignite He-shell burning. The system will become a cataclysmic variable in the distant future when the K-dwarf evolves off of the main sequence. These short-period high-$q$ binaries represent an intriguing formation pathway for compact double white dwarf binaries and thermonuclear supernovae. An ultraviolet spectrum is the most promising avenue for directly detecting the white dwarf companion.</description>

      <title>Eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals: A gateway to probe quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a loop quantum gravity (LQG) inspired rotating black hole, treating it as a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, where an inspiralling object exhibits eccentric motion around the SMBH. With the orbital dynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital evolution, and subsequently generate the gravitational waveforms. To evaluate the difference between EMRI waveforms emitted from the Kerr black hole and a spinning black hole in LQG, we compute the dephasing and mismatch using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observation. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the modified effect of LQG with a parameter as small as $2\times10^{-6}$. The constraint on a parameter in LQG using the Fisher information matrix can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential Primordial Black Hole Production via Delayed Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly, delayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here we consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced black holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, using both numerical and analytical arguments and methods, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a double, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean action over temperature at its minimal value. We show that a modified expansion rate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy density component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model parameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that our findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Blinded Mock Data Challenge for Gravitational-Wave Cosmology-I: Assessing the Robustness of Methods Using Binary Black Holes Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources are standard sirens that provide an independent way to map the cosmic expansion history by combining with an independent redshift measurement either from an electromagnetic counterpart for a bright siren or using different statistical techniques for dark sirens. In this analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge (\texttt{Blinded-MDC}) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble constant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass distribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different analysis setups for the \texttt{Blinded-MDC} to test both statistical and systematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$ with detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs matches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline can recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution. However, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population depends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the data, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by about $1.5\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a limited number of events. In the future, elaborate studies will be required to mitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical complexities. This MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy of standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness of the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic particle acceleration in Alfv\'enic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic turbulence is an effective mechanism for particle acceleration in strongly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In this study, we investigate a scenario where turbulent plasma is influenced by a strong guide magnetic field, resulting in highly anisotropic turbulent fluctuations. In such cases, the magnetic moments of particles are conserved, which means that acceleration can only occur along the direction of the magnetic field. Consistent with previous analytic studies, we find through PIC simulations of magnetically dominated pair plasma that the momenta of accelerated particles are closely aligned with the magnetic field lines. Notably, the alignment angle decreases as particle energy increases, potentially limited only by the inherent curvature and gradients of the turbulent magnetic fluctuations. This finding has significant implications for interpreting the synchrotron radiation emitted by highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Parameter Estimate from Persistent Radio Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$) by combining fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their persistent radio sources (PRSs) through the observationally validated Yang relation, $ L_{\nu} \propto | \mathrm{RM} | $, which links PRS luminosity to the rotation measure (RM) of the associated FRB. Using a mock sample of PRSs, we demonstrate that the Yang relation can help to unravel the degeneracies among $H_0$, baryon density parameter $\Omega_b$, and baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ in the traditional approach of using dispersion measure only to perform cosmological analyses. Our method employs a two-stage Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain $H_0$. Using the available data of six observed PRS systems, we obtain a preliminary constraint of $H_0 = 75 \pm 30~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We briefly discuss possible refinements of the method by reducing residual degeneracies and systematic uncertainties using future data and physical modeling. Our results indicate that the Yang relation can potentially become a new probe for performing FRB cosmology.</description>
