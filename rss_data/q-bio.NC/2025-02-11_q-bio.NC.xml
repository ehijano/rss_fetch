      <title>A state-space framework for causal detection of hippocampal ripple-replay events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hippocampal ripple-replay events are typically identified using a two-step process that at each time point uses past and future data to determine whether an event is occurring. This prevents researchers from identifying these events in real time for closed-loop experiments. It also prevents the identification of periods of nonlocal representation that are not accompanied by large changes in the spectral content of the local field potentials (LFPs). In this work, we present a new state-space model framework that is able to detect concurrent changes in the rhythmic structure of LFPs with nonlocal activity in place cells to identify ripple-replay events in a causal manner. The model combines latent factors related to neural oscillations, represented space, and switches between coding properties to explain simultaneously the spiking activity from multiple units and the rhythmic content of LFPs recorded from multiple sources. The model is temporally causal, meaning that estimates of the switching state can be made at each instant using only past information from the spike and LFP signals, or can be combined with future data to refine those estimates. We applied this model framework to simulated and real hippocampal data to demonstrate its performance in identifying ripple-replay events.</description>

      <title>Multi-Site rs-fMRI Domain Alignment for Autism Spectrum Disorder Auxiliary Diagnosis Based on Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the medical field, most resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data are collected from multiple hospital sites. Multi-site rs-fMRI data can increase the volume of training data, enabling auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for brain diseases to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation algorithms, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract brain network representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, HMMD (Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to align the conditional distributions. This significantly improves the quality of brain representations and enhances diagnostic classification accuracy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust to multi-site heterogeneity and shows promising potential for brain network mechanism analysis.</description>

      <title>Spaces and sequences in the hippocampus: a homological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological techniques have become a popular tool for studying information flows in neural networks. In particular, simplicial homology theory is used to analyze how cognitive representations of space emerge from large conglomerates of independent neuronal contributions. Meanwhile, a growing number of studies suggest that many cognitive functions are sustained by serial patterns of activity. Here, we investigate stashes of such patterns using path homology theory--an impartial, universal approach that does not require a priori assumptions about the sequences' nature, functionality, underlying mechanisms, or other contexts. We focus on the hippocampus -- a key enabler of learning and memory in mammalian brains -- and quantify the ordinal arrangement of its activity similarly to how its topology has previously been studied in terms of simplicial homologies. The results reveal that the vast majority of sequences produced during spatial navigation are structurally equivalent to one another. Only a few classes of distinct sequences form an ordinal schema of serial activity that remains stable as the pool of sequences consolidates. Importantly, the structure of both maps is upheld by combinations of short sequences, suggesting that brief activity motifs dominate physiological computations. This ordinal organization emerges and stabilizes on timescales characteristic of spatial learning, displaying similar dynamics. Yet, the ordinal maps generally do not reflect topological affinities -- spatial and sequential analyses address qualitatively different aspects of spike flows, representing two complementary formats of information processing.</description>

      <title>Topological Time Frequency Analysis of Functional Brain Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel topological framework for analyzing functional brain signals using time-frequency analysis. By integrating persistent homology with time-frequency representations, we capture multi-scale topological features that characterize the dynamic behavior of brain activity. This approach identifies 0D (connected components) and 1D (loops) topological structures in the signal's time-frequency domain, enabling robust extraction of features invariant to noise and temporal misalignments. The proposed method is demonstrated on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, showcasing its ability to discern critical topological patterns and provide insights into functional connectivity. This topological approach opens new avenues for analyzing complex brain signals, offering potential applications in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Neurophysiological correlates to the human brain complexity through $q$-statistical analysis of electroencephalogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospects of assessing neural complexity (NC) by $q$-statistics of the systemic organization of different types and levels of brain activity were studied. In 70 adult subjects, NC was assessed via the parameter $q$ of $q$-statistics, applied to the ongoing and EEG and its spectral power of 20 scalp points (channels). The NC were estimated both globally for all channels (AllCh) and locally (for each single channel) in different Functional States (FSs). The values of $q$ was compared among FSs and single channels, as well they were correlated with the power of $\theta$ (4-8Hz), $\beta_1$ (15-25Hz) and others EEG bands, in each FS. The value of $q$ across all FSs was higher for AllCh than for the single channels FSs. Consistently with previous studies, we found a negative correlation between NC and age. The FSs did not influence the $q$ of the EEG in AllCh, although locally the FS modulated $q$ in a consistent manner (e.g., reducing $q$ in posterior sites with eyes closed). The $q$ was correlated positively with the power of the $\theta$ and negatively with that of the $\beta_1$ band in general. These findings support the idea that, as a first approach, $q$-statistics can describe the human NC. The relationship between $q$ and $\theta$ power aligns with greater NC during FSs such as listening music and resting with eyes open, which is consistent with high-order representations rather than low-informative attentional tasks (OddBall).</description>

      <title>KMT2B-related disorders: expansion of the phenotypic spectrum and long-term efficacy of deep brain stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterozygous mutations in KMT2B are associated with an early-onset, progressive, and often complex dystonia (DYT28). Key characteristics of typical disease include focal motor features at disease presentation, evolving through a caudocranial pattern into generalized dystonia, with prominent oromandibular, laryngeal, and cervical involvement. Although KMT2B-related disease is emerging as one of the most common causes of early-onset genetic dystonia, much remains to be understood about the full spectrum of the disease. We describe a cohort of 53 patients with KMT2B mutations, with detailed delineation of their clinical phenotype and molecular genetic features. We report new disease presentations, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and a subgroup of patients with a non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotype. In addition to the previously reported systemic features, our study has identified co-morbidities, including the risk of status dystonicus, intrauterine growth retardation, and endocrinopathies. Analysis of this study cohort (n = 53) in tandem with published cases (n = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein-truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5 to 37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years. Significant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D) was evident at 6 months, 1 year, and last follow-up (motor, P = 0.001, P = 0.004, and P = 0.012; disability, P = 0.009, P = 0.002, and P = 0.012).</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov theory demonstrating a fundamental limit on the speed of systems consolidation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nervous system reorganizes memories from an early site to a late site, a commonly observed feature of learning and memory systems known as systems consolidation. Previous work has suggested learning rules by which consolidation may occur. Here, we provide conditions under which such rules are guaranteed to lead to stable convergence of learning and consolidation. We use the theory of Lyapunov functions, which enforces stability by requiring learning rules to decrease an energy-like (Lyapunov) function. We present the theory in the context of a simple circuit architecture motivated by classic models of learning in systems consolidation mediated by the cerebellum. Stability is only guaranteed if the learning rate in the late stage is not faster than the learning rate in the early stage. Further, the slower the learning rate at the late stage, the larger the perturbation the system can tolerate with a guarantee of stability. We provide intuition for this result by mapping the consolidation model to a damped driven oscillator system, and showing that the ratio of early- to late-stage learning rates in the consolidation model can be directly identified with the (square of the) oscillator's damping ratio. This work suggests the power of the Lyapunov approach to provide constraints on nervous system function.</description>

      <title>FAST functional connectivity implicates P300 connectivity in working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We investigated the decision processes humans use in covert (single-fixation) search with briefly presented displays having well-separated potential target locations. Performance was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption that the information from the different potential target locations is statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea (foveal neglect), and the implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise can cause search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These findings have broad implications for understanding visual search tasks and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks can predict the surgery outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy surgery, particularly for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), remains a vital treatment option for patients with drug-resistant seizures. However, accurately predicting surgical outcomes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel biomarker derived from brain connectivity changes caused by TLE surgery, analyzed using hyperbolic graph embeddings, to predict surgical success. Using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 51 patients, we examined differences in structural connectivity networks associated to surgical outcomes. Our approach uniquely leveraged hyperbolic disk embeddings of pre- and post-surgery brain networks, successfully distinguishing patients with favorable outcomes from those with poor outcomes. Notably, the method identified regions in the contralateral hemisphere relative to the epileptogenic zone, whose connectivity patterns emerged as a potential biomarker for favorable surgical outcomes. To validate the model, we employed a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. These results underscore the predictive capability of our model and its effectiveness in individual outcome forecasting based on structural network changes. Our findings highlight the use of non-Euclidean hyperbolic graph embeddings to analyze brain networks, offering deeper insights into connectivity alterations in epilepsy, and advancing personalized prediction of surgical outcomes in TLE.</description>

Abstract: Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. We present concise, non-replica derivations of key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Using a cavity approach, we analyze high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points and manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric coupling of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons: fractal attractors, quasi-multistability, and final state sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although neuron models have been well-studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasi-multistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity, which results in a dynamical uncertainty that could have important applications in neurobiology.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs.
