      <title>CoBiTS: Single-detector discrimination of binary black hole signals from glitches using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Conformer neural network, called Conformer Binary neTwork Search, or CoBiTS, for distinguishing binary black hole (BBH) gravitational wave (GW) signals from non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise artifacts in the data from current generation LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors. A large subset of these transient noise artifacts, termed as ``glitches'' for short, trigger BBH search templates. Some of them go on to produce detection candidates and require human vetting, supported by data quality tools, to be correctly identified and vetoed. In its current version, CoBiTS takes as inputs single-detector strain timeseries snippets, claimed by other search pipelines to be containing GW candidates, and outputs the significance of each snippet to contain a BBH signal and a glitch. CoBiTS is shown to be particularly effective in discriminating high-mass BBH signals from blips and scattered light glitches, even when a signal is near concurrent or overlapping with a glitch. The performance of CoBiTS gains from employing Conformer, which is a specialized model that combines convolutional layers and Transformer architecture for sequence modeling tasks. Conformer is especially good at leveraging the strengths of both convolutional layers -- for local feature extraction -- and self-attention layers -- for capturing long-range dependencies.</description>

      <title>Bridging stellar evolution and planet formation: from birth, to survivors of the fittest, to the second generation of planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.</description>

      <title>Monitoring and Evaluating Astronomy-for-Development Initiatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper serves as a practical guide for individuals and organisations seeking to design, implement, and evaluate astronomy-for-development initiatives, as well as those preparing proposals for the International Astronomical Union's Office of Astronomy for Development (IAU OAD) annual Call for Proposals. The paper aims to outline how systematic evidence collection can strengthen project design, enhance accountability, and increase the likelihood of measurable impact. It explains the distinction between monitoring and evaluation, provides guidance on when and how evaluation should be undertaken, and summarises key evaluation types - process, feasibility, impact, outcome, economic, and summative, relevant to astronomy-based interventions. In addition to conceptual discussion, the paper presents a set of practical steps, reflective questions, and examples to help project teams develop a clear theory of change, define appropriate indicators, and anticipate risks and unintended consequences. By contextualising M&amp;E within the broader goals of the OAD and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this work aims to empower practitioners to create evidence-informed, community-driven, and sustainable astronomy-for-development projects that deliver both local and global benefit.</description>

      <title>Characterization of telecentric dual-etalon Fabry-P\'erot systems from observational data. Properties of the CRISP2 instrument at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging Fabry-P\'erot Interferometer (FPI) observations are commonly used in solar physics to infer physical parameters in the photosphere and chromosphere through modeling of the observations. Such techniques require detailed knowledge of the spectral instrumental profile in order to produce accurate results. We present a method to characterize the spatial variation of parameters of dual-etalon FPI instruments mounted in telecentric configuration: spatially-resolved cavity separation and reflectivities of both etalons, and the prefilter variation across the field-of-view. We aim at characterizing the field-of-view dependence of the parameters of the new CRISP2 FPI. We have implemented a forward model of the FPI instrumental degradation combined with a template average quiet-Sun spectra at disk center in order to model two sets of observational data. Our method does not require any change in the optical setup or the utilization of external sources of illumination. We assess the validity of several functional forms in the calculation of the FPI transmission profiles. Our results show that (generally) the inclusion of the secondary transmission peaks at 1 times the Free Spectral Range and a detailed estimate of the prefilter curve is necessary to obtain accurate values of both etalon reflectivities. For narrow prefilters (relative to the FSR), the former requirement can be relaxed. Our results show that the cavity separation of CRISP2 is very flat, showing an RMS variation below 1.9 nm over the entire field-of-view for both etalons. Reflectivity RMS variations are 0.4% and 0.3% for the primary and secondary etalons at 617.3 nm. We have assessed data and modeling requirements in order to derive accurate FPI parameters and minimize errors in the determination of etalon reflectivities.</description>

      <title>Designing the Community Infrastructure for ESO's Next Transformational Facility. Equitable Governance and Sustainable Teams for 2040s Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scientific ambitions of the 2040s will require large, interdisciplinary teams operating across continents, institutions, and increasingly heterogeneous political and funding landscapes. While significant effort is devoted to advancing the technical capabilities of future astronomical facilities, frameworks for coordinating and sustaining the associated community systems are often developed in parallel rather than embedded as coherent, long-term structures at the scale needed to fully realise this ambition. In this white paper, submitted as part of the ESO Expanding Horizons initiative, we draw on experience from established observatories and emerging collaborations to identify key community-level challenges. We argue that a central and transversal scientific challenge for the 2040s is to operate a flagship observatory in which access to telescope time, data, leadership, training, and career development is equitable across institutions, member states, and beyond. We propose that access and participation be treated as integral design parameters, embedded from the conceptual stage and sustained throughout the facility lifecycle, in order to ensure long-term scientific excellence, sustainability, and societal return.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the MAST Data Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) hosts science-ready data products from over twenty NASA missions, plus community-contributed data collections, and other select surveys. The data support forefront research in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelength bands. We have constructed bibliographies for each mission from publications in nearly 40 professional journals, and have identified more than 37,000 refereed articles where investigators made a science usage of data hosted in MAST. The publication rate over the last 50 years shows that most MAST missions have had very high productivity during their in-service lifetimes, and have remained so for years or decades afterward. Annual citations to these publications, a measure of impact on research, are robust for most missions, with citations that grow over more than a decade. Most of the citations come from about 10% of articles within each mission.
  We examined the bibliographies of the active missions HST and JWST in greater detail. For HST the rate of archival publications exceeded those authored by the original observing teams within a decade of launch, and is now more than 3 times higher. Early indications hint that JWST archival articles could dominate the publication rate even sooner. The production of articles resulting from any given observing program can extend for decades. Programs with small and very large allocations of observing time tend to be particularly productive per unit of observing time. For HST in general, a first publication appears within 1.5 yr for 50% of observing programs, and within 3.8 yr for 80% of programs. We discuss various external factors that affect publication metrics, their strengths and limitations for measuring scientific impact, and the challenges of making meaningful comparisons of publication metrics across missions.</description>

      <title>Continuous Wide-Field Optical Monitoring for Very Early-Phase Transient Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of transient phenomena in a multimessenger context is expected to remain a major pillar of astrophysical discovery in the decades ahead. Supernovae, Kilonovae, Black-Hole formation, Novae, GRBs, and tidal disruption events are prime examples, as their earliest phases link electromagnetic radiation to gravitational waves, neutrinos, and high-energy emission. Yet, the physics connecting these messengers unfolds within minutes to hours, while traditional surveys revisit the same region of the sky on the scale of days/weeks, missing when the event begins. Current survey facilities excel at answering what happened and how often, but essentially fail in addressing how it happened and how it couples to gravitational waves, neutrinos, or high-energy emission. Continuous wide-area optical monitoring, as proposed here, removes this limitation. The traditional approach, where a GW or neutrino alert triggers electromagnetic follow-up, is now complemented, and sometimes reversed: early electromagnetic discoveries can prompt searches for weaker gravitational waves or neutrino signals that would otherwise be missed. In the Einstein Telescope era, wide-field optical monitoring will allow us to find the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave events and understand their physics. At the same time, a telescope capable of continuous monitoring provides immediate scientific value for planetary defense, space-debris tracking, stellar variability, exoplanets transit monitoring, accretion-driven activity, and when we step into a new observational territory, the true discoveries are often the ones we did not expect. In this vision, continuous time-domain astronomy does not replace classical surveys: it completes them by supplying the missing temporal dimension. Follow-up observations remain essential, but they now begin at the physical onset of the event rather than after its evolution is underway.</description>

      <title>Red noise-based false alarm thresholds for astrophysical periodograms via Whittle's approximation to the likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomers who search for periodic signals using Lomb-Scargle periodograms rely on false alarm level (FAL) estimates to identify statistically significant peaks. Although FALs are often calculated from white noise models, many astronomical time series suffer from red noise. Prewhitening is a statistical technique in which a continuum model is subtracted from log power spectrum estimate, after which the observer can proceed with a white-noise treatment. Here we present a prewhitening-based method of calculating frequency-dependent FALs. We fit power laws and autoregressive models of order 1 to each Lomb-Scargle periodogram by minimizing the Whittle approximation to the negative log-likelihood (NLL), then calculate FALs based on the best-fit model power spectrum. Our technique is a novel extension of the Whittle NLL to datasets with uneven time sampling. We demonstrate FAL calculations using observations of $\alpha$~Cen~B, GJ~581, HD 192310, synthetic data from the radial velocity (RV) Fitting Challenge, and {\it Kepler} observations of a differential rotator. The {\it Kepler} data analysis shows that only true rotation signals are detected by red-noise FALs, while white-noise FALs suggest all spurious peaks in the low-frequency range are significant. A high-frequency sinusoid injected into $\alpha$~Cen~B $\log R^{\prime}_{HK}$ observations exceeds the 1\% red-noise FAL despite having only 8.9\% of the power of the dominant rotation signal. In a periodogram of HD 192310 RVs, peaks associated with differential rotation and planets are detected against the 5\% red-noise FAL without iterative model fitting or subtraction. Software for calculating red noise-based FALs is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the physics of dwarf galaxies in the 2040s: The case for a next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility with fibres and IFUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies ($M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$) are the most numerous galaxies in the Universe and critical probes of dark matter, baryonic feedback, and galaxy formation. Despite significant progress from wide-field imaging surveys, the majority of dwarf candidates beyond the Local Group will lack spectroscopic follow-up, leaving fundamental questions about their internal kinematics, stellar populations, chemical enrichment, and dark matter content unresolved. Existing and planned facilities cannot efficiently provide the necessary spectroscopy for low-surface-brightness dwarfs over wide areas. We advocate for a dedicated large-aperture ($\geq 20$ m), wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility with deployable or monolithic IFUs, capable of high signal-to-noise observations down to $I_{\rm E} \gtrsim 22-23$ mag. Such a facility would enable transformative studies of dark matter cores, baryonic feedback, tidal interactions, environmental effects, and stellar populations, extending the spectroscopic exploration of low-mass galaxies to $z \sim 1.5$, and providing decisive tests of $\Lambda$CDM and alternative dark matter models. Beyond dwarfs, this capability would impact galaxy evolution, strong and weak lensing studies, and cosmology, ensuring that imaging data from the 2030s and 2040s can be fully exploited.</description>

      <title>Robust and scalable simulation-based inference for gravitational wave signals with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations. We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.</description>

      <title>Standard Sirens in 2040s: Probing the Cosmic Expansion History with Gravitational Waves and Spectroscopic Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences have matured into a robust cosmological probe, providing self-calibrated luminosity distance measurements independent of any cosmic distance ladder, hence the term "standard sirens". The binary neutron star merger GW170817 delivered the first such measurement of the Hubble constant, demonstrating that GWs offer a path to precision cosmology with systematics orthogonal to standard cosmological probes. To convert GW distances into cosmological parameters, redshift information is essential. To maximize the scientific potential, the redshift must be obtained from individual galaxies, either by identifying electromagnetic counterparts of GW events (bright sirens) or by statistically associating potential hosts within the GW localization volume (dark sirens). The precision of these redshifts sets the achievable accuracy. Forecasts show that photometric uncertainties degrade cosmological constraints by up to an order of magnitude compared to spectroscopic ones. Wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities will therefore be an essential infrastructure for GW cosmology in the 2040s.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Performance Computing (HPC) based simulations are crucial in Astrophysics and Cosmology (A&amp;C), helping scientists investigate and understand complex astrophysical phenomena. Taking advantage of exascale computing capabilities is essential for these efforts. However, the unprecedented architectural complexity of exascale systems impacts legacy codes. The SPACE Centre of Excellence (CoE) aims to re-engineer key astrophysical codes to tackle new computational challenges by adopting innovative programming paradigms and software (SW) solutions. SPACE brings together scientists, code developers, HPC experts, hardware (HW) manufacturers, and SW developers. This collaboration enhances exascale A&amp;C applications, promoting the use of exascale and post-exascale computing capabilities. Additionally, SPACE addresses high-performance data analysis for the massive data outputs from exascale simulations and modern observations, using machine learning (ML) and visualisation tools. The project facilitates application deployment across platforms by focusing on code repositories and data sharing, integrating European astrophysical communities around exascale computing with standardised SW and data protocols.</description>

      <title>Optical SETI at ESO in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The searches for other life and for intelligence are fundamental problems that science faces today. Most searches so far have been focused on radio, but optical laser communication is an alternative, well suited for a ground-based observatory. A project to search for artificial laser communications with the current and future extreme multiplexity spectroscopic facilities that ESO may develop by the 2040s is outlined. The monochromatic light is a clearly identifiable technosignature. The enormous corollary outreach potential of this initiative is underlined.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Detector Polarization Angle Calibration using Sparse Wire Grid with Initial Data Sets of the Small Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved measurements of $B$-modes in the cosmic microwave background can be obtained through accurate calibration of the orientation of detector antennas as projected onto the sky. Miscalibration of the detector polarization angle leads to a leakage of $E$-modes into $B$-modes, which can bias the detection of the latter. To achieve a $\sigma(r)$ of 0.003, the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes are required to calibrate the global polarization angle on the sky with an accuracy ${\lesssim}0.1^\circ$. We demonstrate a fully remote-controllable calibration system using a ``sparse wire grid," which injects a rotatable linear polarized signal across the telescope's focal plane. This calibration system is installed and operational on a Small Aperture Telescope at its observing site at the Parque Astron\'omico in the Atacama desert in Chile. We developed a pipeline for the detector polarization angle calibration, and demonstrate it using initial data for 93~GHz and 145~GHz frequency bands. The observed distribution of detector polarization angles is in agreement with the instrument design. Statistical uncertainties for the relatively calibrated polarization angles are $0.02^\circ$ and $0.03^\circ$ at 93~GHz and 145~GHz, respectively. Systematic uncertainty was evaluated to be $0.08^\circ$ at the hardware development and fabrication stage. Their sum in quadrature is less than $0.1^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Towards DM-free search for Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning -- I. An implementation on multibeam data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for fleeting radio transients like fast radio bursts (FRBs) with wide-field radio telescopes has become a common challenge in data-intensive science. Conventional algorithms normally cost enormous time to seek candidates by finding the correct dispersion measures, of which the process is so-called dedispersion. Here we present a novel scheme to identify FRB signals from raw data without dedispersion using Machine Learning (ML). Under the data environment for multibeam receivers, we train the EfficientNet model and achieve both exceeding 92% accuracy and precision in FRB recognition. We find that the searching efficiency can be significantly enhanced without the procedure of dedispersion compared with conventional softwares like TransientX and presto. Specifically, the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) for single-beam and multibeam data has been investigated, and we find ML can naturally mitigate RFI under the multibeam environment. Finally, we validate the trained model on actual data from the current FRB surveys carried out by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, which provides considerable potential for real implementation in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and operation of a pyramidal horn radio telescope built for detecting the Galactic 21 cm neutral hydrogen line emission. The system employs an SDR-based pipeline to obtain drift-scan observations, which were calibrated and processed to generate HI sky maps, a Galactic rotation curve and spiral arm features. This demonstrates that this low-cost system is effective both for educational purposes and scientific exploration of Galactic structure at radio frequencies.</description>

      <title>GALATEA: The 15-m Galactic Archaeology Spectroscopic Surveyor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textsc{GALATEA} (the \emph{Galactic Archaeology and Local-group Astrophysics Telescope for Extended Areas}) is a concept for a dedicated 15-m, wide-field, 10,000-fibre spectroscopic survey facility in the northern hemisphere, optimized for degree-scale, multi-object spectroscopy. With a $\sim 1~\mathrm{deg}^2$ corrected field-of-view and both medium- ($R \simeq 5{,}000$--$10{,}000$) and high-resolution ($R \simeq 20{,}000$--$25{,}000$) modes, \textsc{GALATEA} would open a new regime in Galactic and Local Group astronomy: deep, chemically detailed spectroscopy of vast samples of individual stars in the outer disc, warp, flare, halo substructures, M31, M33 and their dwarf satellites, far beyond the reach of current surveys. By delivering precise radial velocities and detailed chemical abundances for stars with exquisite astrometry and photometry from \emph{Gaia} and its proposed near-infrared successor \emph{GaiaNIR}, \textsc{GALATEA} will complete and fully exploit the 6D phase-space and chemodynamical information for these populations. Compared to existing northern multi-object spectroscopic facilities (BOSS, APOGEE, DESI, LAMOST, WEAVE, PFS), \textsc{GALATEA} delivers an order-of-magnitude jump in survey power ($\propto D^{2} \times N_{\mathrm{fibres}}$) by combining a 15-m aperture, $\sim 1~\mathrm{deg}^2$ field, and 10{,}000 fibres in a single dedicated facility. It is also strongly complementary to 30--40\,m ELTs: GALATEA provides the wide-field, high-multiplex discovery and chemodynamical mapping, while ELTs deliver deep, high-resolution follow-up of the faintest or most complex targets.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved X-ray spectra of Proxima Centauri as seen by XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar soft X-ray ([1, 100] Angstrom) and Extreme Ultraviolet (also EUV, [100, 920] Angstrom; jointly, XUV) radiation affects the evolution and chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. It is however uncertain to what extent the radiation's short-term variability contributes to these effects. We are interested in what this variability might imply for planets around M dwarf stars, and focus on Proxima Centauri (Prox Cen) for three reasons: it is an active M dwarf with high levels of variability; it hosts a likely terrestrial exoplanet within its habitable zone (HZ) that will be a prime target for future direct imaging; its proximity has led to extensive observations. We set out to produce time-resolved XUV spectra of Prox Cen that will serve as input to atmospheric models, and to characterize the intrinsic variability of the star. We analyzed the entire dataset of archival XMM-Newton observations for Prox Cen. To derive the time-resolved X-ray spectra, we implemented a new pile-up correction, a new adaptive time-binning algorithm, and a time-dependent plasma model selection. The estimated EUV spectrum is based on a published template, that we scale with proposed relationships between X-ray and EUV fluxes. We produced spectra of Prox Cen from 1 to 920 Angstrom over ~260 ks of observations with unprecedented time resolution. The instantaneous X-ray flux of Prox Cen varies between about 20 times and one-fifth of the average value over the available baseline, with significant differences between wavelengths. We further quantify how variability affects the estimated average flux when a limited number of snapshots (each typically of 30 ks exposure) are available, as is common in X-ray surveys. Future investigations of the atmospheres of Prox Cen b should fold in the time variability and uncertainties described here.</description>

      <title>A Search for Radio Technosignatures from Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS with the Allen Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2025 July, the third-ever interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, was discovered on its ingress into the Solar System. Similar to the NASA Voyager missions sent in 1977, science probes by extraterrestrial life (artifact ``technosignatures'') could be sent to explore other stellar systems like our own. In this campaign, we used the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to observe 3I/ATLAS from 1--9~GHz. We detected nearly 74 million narrowband hits in 7.25~hr of data using the newly-developed search pipeline \texttt{bliss}. We then applied blanking in frequency and drift rate to mitigate Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in our dataset, narrowing the dataset down to $\sim$2 million hits. These hits were further filtered by the localization code \texttt{NBeamAnalysis}, and the remaining 211 hits were visually inspected in the time-frequency domain. We did not find any signals worthy of additional follow-up. Accounting for the Doppler drift correction and given the non-detection, we are able to set an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limit of $10-110$~W on radio technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS across the frequency and drift rate ranges covered by our survey.</description>

      <title>The size of 3I/ATLAS from non-gravitational acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third macroscopic interstellar object detected in the solar system recently passed through perihelion, with the best-fitting models of its trajectory now featuring non-gravitational accelerations. We assess how much mass loss is required to produce plausible non-gravitational acceleration solutions and compare with estimates of the mass loss. We find that they are consistent when the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is around 1 km in diameter. For a recent solution with a time lag in the acceleration from Eubanks et al, we find diameters between 820 meters and 1050 meters, assuming an outgassing asymmetry factor $\zeta=0.5$ and a density of the comet nucleus $\rho=0.5$ g cm$^{-3}$. The limits on the diameter scale as $(\zeta/\rho)^{1/3}$. Substantial extrapolation is required in general to compare non-gravitational accelerations to mass loss rates, so reliable estimates of the mass loss rate at other stages of the comet's trajectory will substantially reduce the systematic uncertainty in this estimate.</description>

      <title>Imaging the LkCa 15 system in polarimetry and total intensity without self-subtraction artefacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying young protoplanetary disks is essential for understanding planet formation, but traditional angular differential imaging can introduce self-subtraction artefacts that hinder interpretation of small-scale structures. We present high-resolution total- and polarized-intensity Ks-band images of the LkCa~15 system obtained with SPHERE using near-simultaneous reference-star differential imaging (star-hopping), yielding self-subtraction-free images beyond 0.1 arcsec. LkCa~15 hosts a ~160 au protoplanetary disk and has previously been reported to harbour candidate protoplanets at separations of 15--18 au. We analyse the disk morphology and dust properties and search for super-Jupiter planets beyond 20 au. We first model the near-infrared scattered-light images together with ALMA submillimetre continuum data using RADMC-3D and a two grain-size (micron and millimetre) compact olivine model. While this model broadly reproduces the disk geometry, it overpredicts the degree of forward scattering in the near-infrared. To investigate this discrepancy, we extract the scattering phase function S(theta) and polarized fraction P(theta) from the SPHERE data and compare them with aggregate-scattering models. The observed phase functions disfavour compact Mie spheres and are better matched by porous aggregates (CAHP). Recomputing the scattered-light models with porous CAHP grains in the disk surface layer significantly improves agreement with the observed Ks-band morphology and polarization, while retaining compact millimetre grains to reproduce the ALMA continuum. No new planetary companions are detected; we place upper mass limits of ~1.5 MJ beyond 200 au and ~3.6 MJ in the inner disk. Our results demonstrate that combining star-hopping imaging with phase-function diagnostics provides strong constraints on dust grain properties in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Detecting false positives with PLATO using double-aperture photometry and centroid shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PLATO will discover exoplanets around Sun-like stars through transit photometry and characterize their host stars using asteroseismology. Since photometry for most PLATO targets will be extracted on board, an efficient strategy to detect false positives (FPs), defined as transit-like signals not caused by planets, is required. Centroid shifts are a standard FP diagnostic, but only 5% to 20% of PLATO's largest stellar sample (P5) will have centroids computed on board, motivating the need for an alternative strategy. We propose a double-aperture photometry approach to detect FPs, testing two mask types: extended masks, which enlarge the nominal aperture, and secondary masks, centered on the main contaminant. For each mask type, we derive flux and centroid-shift metrics and evaluate their ability to discriminate FPs. Using Gaia DR3, we define P5 targets and their background stars, which are assumed to be eclipsing binaries with transit depths and durations drawn from observed distributions. From simulated photometry and centroid shifts, we compute extended and secondary fluxes as well as extended, secondary, and nominal centroids, and compare their FP detection efficiency. Under these assumptions, approximately 35% of P5 targets have a single FP-producing contaminant and about 22% have two or more. Secondary flux achieves the highest detection efficiency (92%), followed by extended centroid shifts (87%) and nominal centroids (84%). Owing to its lower computational and telemetry cost, double-aperture photometry provides an efficient solution for rejecting a large fraction of FP signals caused by eclipsing binaries.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the hemispheres of Teegarden's Star b with LIFE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teegarden's Star is one of the most promising targets for the first observations of LIFE, as a non-transiting rocky planet with similar bulk properties to the Earth, and a relatively quiescent M-dwarf host star. We use LIFEsim, a software developed by the ETH LIFE team, along with thermal emission maps obtained from a suite of three-dimensional global climate model (GCM) simulations, to explore the sensitivity of LIFE to the observation geometry. We find that 3 days of observation in broadband would be enough to disentangle the hemispheres of the planet with a 1{\sigma} or 3{\sigma} confidence level with a baseline or optimistic scenario respectively. Doing the same for a fast-rotator in the habitable zone of a G-class star would be prohibitively challenging. Given enough observation time, the sensitivity of LIFE may allow some spatial resolution of Teegarden's Star b to be achieved, which may directly link to the presence of water clouds and therefore an active hydrology.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Differential Radial Velocities of C3PO Wide Binaries: A Test of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-binary stars, separated by thousands of AU, reside in low-acceleration regimes where Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predicts deviation from Newtonian gravity. However, Gaia radial velocities (RVs) lack the precision to resolve the small velocity differences expected in these systems, limiting previous MOND analyses to two-dimensional kinematics. In this paper, we introduce a technique to measure differential RVs of wide binary stars using high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra. We apply this method to measure differential RVs of 100 wide-binaries from the C3PO survey and achieved precisions of $8-15$ m/s per binary pair, a $\sim 10-100 \times$ improvement (median $\sim 24 \times$) over Gaia DR3. Combining these measurements with Gaia astrometry, we construct a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer the orbital elements of all wide-binary pairs and the global MOND acceleration scale ($a_0$). We test two commonly used interpolating functions in MOND formulation: the simple form ($b=1, \mu = x/(1+x)$) and the standard form ($b=2, \mu = x/\sqrt{1+x^2}$). Our results indicate tension with MOND at the presently accepted $a_0$ value: for $b=1$, the canonical value is excluded at $3.1\sigma$, while for $b=2$, the exclusion is at $1.9\sigma$.</description>

      <title>ContEvol formalism: numerical methods based on Hermite spline optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the ContEvol (continuous evolution) formalism, a family of implicit numerical methods which only need to solve linear equations and are almost symplectic. Combining values and derivatives of functions, ContEvol outputs allow users to recover full history and render full distributions. Using the classic harmonic oscillator as a prototype case, we show that ContEvol methods lead to lower-order errors than two commonly used Runge--Kutta methods. Applying first-order ContEvol to simple celestial mechanics problems, we demonstrate that deviation from equation(s) of motion of ContEvol tracks is still $\mathcal{O}(h^5)$ ($h$ is the step length) by our definition. Numerical experiments with an eccentric elliptical orbit indicate that first-order ContEvol is a viable alternative to classic Runge--Kutta or the symplectic leapfrog integrator. Solving the stationary Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics, we manifest ability of ContEvol to handle boundary value or eigenvalue problems. Important directions for future work, including mathematical foundations, higher dimensions, and technical improvements, are discussed at the end of this article.</description>

      <title>The Ultraviolet Type Ia Supernova CubeSat (UVIa): Science Motivation &amp; Mission Concept</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ultraviolet (UV) Type Ia Supernova Mission (UVIa) is a CubeSat/SmallSat concept that stands to test critical space-borne UV technology for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) while elucidating long-standing questions about the explosion mechanisms of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). UVIa will observe whether any SNe Ia emit excess UV light shortly after explosion to test progenitor/explosion models and provide follow-up over many days to characterize their UV and optical flux variations over time, assembling a comprehensive multi-band UV and optical low-redshift anchor sample for upcoming high-redshift SNe Ia surveys (e.g., Euclid, Vera Rubin Observatory, Nancy Roman Space Telescope). UVIa's mission profile requires it to perform rapid and frequent visits to newly discovered SNe Ia, simultaneously observing each SNe Ia in two UV bands (FUV: 1500-1800A and NUV: 1800-2400A) and one optical band (u-band: 3000-4200A). In this study, we describe the UVIa mission concept science motivation and basic mission design. The UVIa mission concept has been submitted to the CubeSats category of the NASA ROSES Astrophysics Research &amp; Analysis (APRA) program (\$10M cost cap) and NASA Astrophysics Pioneers program (\$20M cost cap).</description>

      <title>SPAN: A cross-platform Python GUI software for optical and near-infrared spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing availability of high-quality optical and near-infrared spectroscopic data, as well as advances in modelling techniques, have greatly expanded the scientific potential of spectroscopic studies. However, the software tools needed to fully exploit this potential often remain fragmented across multiple specialised packages, requiring scripting skills and manual integration to handle complex workflows. In this paper we present SPAN (SPectral ANalysis), a cross-platform, Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) software that unifies the essential tools for modern spectral analysis within a single, user-friendly environment. While SPAN can be used with a variety of spectroscopic targets, its primary focus is the analysis of unresolved galaxy spectra. SPAN allows users to extract 1D spectra from FITS images and datacubes, perform spectral processing (e.g. Doppler correction, continuum modelling, denoising), and carry out detailed analyses, including line-strength measurements, stellar and gas kinematics, and stellar population studies, using both built-in routines and the widely adopted pPXF algorithm for full spectral fitting. It runs natively on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, and is fully task-driven, requiring no prior coding experience. We validate SPAN by comparing its output with existing pipelines and literature studies. By offering a flexible, accessible, and well integrated environment, SPAN simplifies and accelerates the spectral analysis workflow, while maintaining scientific accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and initial testing of a low-frequency radio telescope prototype developed for the CANTAR (Colombian Antarctic Telescope for 21-cm Absorption during Reionization) experiment. Operating from 100 to 200 MHz, the system integrates a blade dipole antenna inspired by the EDGES high-band design with a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver. We report simulations of antenna impedance and beam chromaticity, along with SDR performance tests (Limenet Mini, Ettus E310, USRP2920). A dual-stage low-noise amplifier reduces system temperature, enabling foreground-sensitive observations. Radiometric estimates suggest sub-mK sensitivity is achievable with 1000 h of integration. This prototype forms part of Colombia's emerging infrastructure for 21-cm cosmology, with deployments planned in low-RFI sites in the Colombian Andes and Antarctica.</description>

      <title>Modeling spectral filtering effects on color-matching functions: Implications for observer variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of spectral filtering on color-matching functions (CMFs) and its implications for observer variability modeling. We conducted color matching experiments with two observers, both with and without a spectral filter in front of a bipartite field. Using a novel computational approach, we estimated the filter transmittance and transformation matrix necessary to convert unfiltered CMFs to filtered CMFs. Statistical analysis revealed good agreement between estimated and measured filter characteristics, particularly in central wavelength regions. Applying this methodology to compare between Stiles and Burch 1955 (SB1955) mean observer CMFs and our previously published "ICVIO" mean observer CMFs, we identified a "yellow" (short-wavelength suppressing) filter that effectively transforms between these datasets. This finding aligns with our hypothesis that observed differences between the CMF sets are attributable to age-related lens yellowing (average observer age: 49 years in ICVIO versus 30 years in SB1955). Our approach enables efficient representation of observer variability through a single filter rather than three separate functions, offering potentially reduced experimental overhead while maintaining accuracy in characterizing individual color vision differences.</description>

      <title>MCI: Multi-Channel Imager on the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) is a powerful near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible imager onboard the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The MCI provides three imaging channels, which are the NUV channel, the Blue channel and the Red channel, with the wavelength range of 255-430 nm, 430-700 nm, and 700-1000 nm, respectively. MCI's three channels can target the same field simultaneously, which is unique compared to other imagers onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Each channel employs a CCD focal plane of 9216 x 9232 pixels and $\sim$7\arcmin.5 x 7\arcmin.5 field of view (FOV), which are about $\gtrsim 4$ times greater than the FOVs of HST imagers. The MCI's three channels feature unprecedented sensitivities and field of views complement the NUV and visible capabilities of the CSST for high-precision photometry and weak-signal detection, which would help build a new standard-star system and the deepest UV-Optical exposures for CSST. Rich filter sets of MCI would help explore other sciences such as local emission line mapping, high-z Ly$\alpha$ emitters searching, etc. Here we present key design features, results of current ground tests, and suggested observing strategies of the MCI.</description>

      <title>Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky.
  Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper, we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the detected RFI.</description>

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observatory is a future L3 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) to detect gravitational waves, set to launch in 2035. The detector constellation will conduct interferometry to picometer stability over an unprecedented arm length of 2.5 million km. In this paper, we present the development and testing results for the Zerodur interferometer (ZIFO), an optical demonstrator built to validate critical technology for the test setup of the interferometric core of LISA. Optical path length stability measurements on the ZIFO demonstrate successful reduction of bench noise to maintain the 10 pm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ specification across the 1 mHz to 1 Hz frequency band. We also identify and characterize dominant noise sources from phasemeters and correlations of beam tilt into the path length that were observed during the test campaign.</description>

      <title>Periodicities in radio emissions from the Jupiter's magnetosphere and consequences for radio emissions from star-exoplanet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for radio signals from exoplanets or star-planet interactions is a topic of major scientific interest, as it is likely the best way to detect and measure a planetary magnetic field and, therefore, to probe the inner structure of exoplanets. However, detecting these radio emissions is challenging, since they are anisotropic by nature, sporadic, and of low intensity because of their great distances, and because the sky cannot be monitored continuously. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations, and identify the implications of the measured period. The identification of periodic radio signals is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle analysis. We first apply the technique to simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows us to characterize the origin of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as to identify peaks corresponding to real periods in the studied system, and to harmonic or beat periods. We then validate this method with a real signal, using approximately 1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years, to detect the periodicities of Jovian radio emissions (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the LombScargle periodogram allows us to correctly identify periodic radio signals, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the beat period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, ...</description>

      <title>A Detailed Investigation of HD 209458 b HST &amp; JWST Transmission Spectra with SANSAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HD 209458 b is the first exoplanet on which an atmosphere was detected. Since then, its atmosphere has been investigated using multiple telescopes and instruments. However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable. While HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST NIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity with highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD 209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a newly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model with free retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and C/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar values using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam observations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and C/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model choice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry retrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar constraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone can lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and, therefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared observations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity. In particular, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we cannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline.</description>

      <title>On the statistical convergence of N-body simulations of the Solar System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most direct N-body integrations of planetary systems use a symplectic integrator with a fixed timestep. A large timestep is desirable in order to speed up the numerical simulations. However, simulations yield unphysical results if the timestep is too large. Surprisingly, no systematic convergence study has been performed on long (Gyr) timescales. In this paper we present numerical experiments to determine the minimum timestep one has to use in long-term integrations of the Solar System in order to recover the system's fundamental secular frequencies and instability rate. We find that timesteps of up to 32 days, i.e. a third of Mercury's orbital period, yield physical results in an ensemble of 5 Gyr integrations. We argue that the chaotic diffusion that drives the Solar System's long-term evolution dominates over numerical diffusion and timestep resonances. Our results bolster confidence that the statistical results of most simulations in the literature are indeed physical and provide guidance on how to run time and energy efficient simulations while making sure results can be trusted.</description>

      <title>Mitigating incoherent excess variance in high-redshift 21 cm observations with multi-output cross-Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systematic effects that limit the achievable sensitivity of current low-frequency radio telescopes to the 21 cm signal are among the foremost challenges in observational 21 cm cosmology. The standard approach to retrieving the 21 cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from bright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature, in contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21 cm signal. Contaminants exhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to separate from the 21 cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from these contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our ability to detect the 21 cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are incoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent excess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this paper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process regression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them from the 21 cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of observation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic signals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric visibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes containing foregrounds, 21 cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The simulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over standard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the contaminants resembles that of the 21 cm signal. Simulations performed on a variety of 21 cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing the 21 cm signal.</description>

Abstract: We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.</description>

      <title>Observing Double White Dwarfs with the Lunar GW Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07849</link>

Abstract: The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector that will observe in the decihertz (dHz) frequency region. In this band, binary white dwarf systems are expected to merge, emitting gravitational waves. Detecting this emission opens new perspectives for understanding the Type Ia supernova progenitors and for investigating dense matter physics. In this paper, we present the capabilities of LGWA to detect and localize short-period double white dwarfs in terms of sky locations and distances. The analysis employs realistic spatial distributions and merger rates, as well as binary-mass distributions informed by population-synthesis models. The simulated population of double white dwarfs is generated using the SeBa stellar-evolution code, coupled with dedicated sampling algorithms. The performance of the LGWA detector, both in terms of signal detectability and parameter estimation, is assessed using standard gravitational-wave data analysis techniques, including Fisher matrix methods, as implemented in the GWFish and Legwork codes. The analysis indicates that, over 10 years of observation, LGWA could detect approximately 30 monochromatic Galactic sources and 10 extragalactic mergers, demonstrating the unique potential of decihertz gravitational-wave detectors to access and characterize extragalactic DWD populations. This will open new avenues for understanding Type Ia supernova progenitors and the physics of DWDs.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Neutron Star Population with the SKAO telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The known population of non-accreting neutron stars is ever growing and currently consists of more than 3500 sources. Pulsar surveys with the SKAO telescopes will greatly increase the known population, adding radio pulsars to every subgroup in the radio-loud neutron star family. These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of neutron stars and discuss how the SKAO telescopes will aid in our understanding of the neutron star population.</description>
