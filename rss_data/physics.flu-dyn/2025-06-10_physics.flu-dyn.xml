      <title>Energy partition in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a simple and straightforward method to derive the energy partition in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence that was first studied by Lee and then more rigorously by Chandrasekhar. By investigating the energy equation we find that the turbulent viscous and ohmic dissipations are comparable to each other. Under the condition that turbulent viscosity and turbulent magnetic diffusivity are comparable, we deduce that the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies depends on the ratio of the turbulent magnetic lengthscale to turbulent velocity lengthscale of the largest eddies. When the two largest lengthscales are comparable, the two energies are in equipartition.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of complete transition to turbulence with a fluid at supercritical pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to investigate the unexplored laminar-to-turbulent transition of a heated flat-plate boundary layer with a fluid at supercritical pressure. Two temperature ranges are considered: a subcritical case, where the fluid remains entirely in the liquid-like regime, and a transcritical case, where the pseudo-critical (Widom) line is crossed and pseudo-boiling occurs. Fully compressible direct numerical simulations are used to study (i) the linear and nonlinear instabilities, (ii) the breakdown to turbulence, and (iii) the fully developed turbulent boundary layer. In the transcritical regime, two-dimensional forcing generates not only a train of billow-like structures around the Widom line, resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but also near-wall travelling regions of flow reversal. These spanwise-oriented billows dominate the early nonlinear stage. When high subharmonic three-dimensional forcing is applied, staggered $\Lambda$-vortices emerge more abruptly than in the subcritical case. However, unlike the classic H-type breakdown under zero pressure gradient observed in ideal-gas and subcritical regimes, the H-type breakdown is triggered by strong shear layers caused by flow reversals -- similar to that observed in adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers. Without oblique wave forcing, transition is only slightly delayed and follows a naturally selected fundamental breakdown (K-type) scenario. Hence, in the transcritical regime, it is possible to trigger nonlinearities and achieve transition to turbulence relatively early using only a single two-dimensional wave that strongly amplifies background noise. In the fully turbulent region, we demonstrate that variable-property scaling accurately predicts turbulent skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Approach to Novel Boundary Design in Deterministic Lateral Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a high-resolution separation technique used in various fields. A fundamental challenge in DLD is ensuring uniform flow characteristics across channel, particularly near sidewalls where pillar matrix inevitably loses its lateral periodicity. Despite attempts in the literature to improve boundary design, significant variations in critical diameter persist near sidewalls, adversely affecting the separation performance. We propose a combinatorial framework to develop an optimal design aimed at minimizing flow disturbances. We employ a set of parameterized boundary profiles, integrating multiple DLD channels, each with distinct design parameters, into a single microfluidic chip in parallel. Fluorescent beads are introduced into the chip via through-wafer via, flowing through inlet buses and DLD channels. The width of large-particle-laden stream downstream of channels is determined using fluorescence microscopy and image processing. The experimental results suggest an optimal range of design parameters for depletion and accumulation sidewalls. We conduct numerical simulations to further explore the experimental findings and refine the optimization. Comparison of results with existing design methodologies in the literature demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed framework. This work paves the way for design of DLD systems with enhanced performance, particularly for applications requiring high recovery rates and purity simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence under vorticity and strain-rate control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of small-scale structures in turbulent Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) flows through the application of preferential flow control targeting high vorticity or high strain-rate regions (Buzzicotti et al. 2020). Through numerical simulations, we analyze the effects of flow control on RT statistics, mixing, and anisotropy behavior. Our results reveal that eliminating intense small-scale motion leads to the formation of more organized and coherent flow structures, with reduced mixing and enhanced anisotropy. The alignment of vorticity and scalar gradient with the strain-rate eigen-frame is also altered by the flow control, reducing the downscale cascade of kinetic energy and the scalar variance. When the control threshold is set below the spatial mean of the vorticity or strain-rate field, turbulent motion in RT is significantly suppressed. Moreover, flow control eliminates regions of extreme vorticity and strain-rate, leading to overlapped high vorticity and high strain-rate regions with reduced turbulence intensity and more coherent structures. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms played by small-scale structures in RT flows and their modulation through flow control. This work has broader implications for realistic scenarios, such as RT flows under magnetic fields or rotation, where suppression of small-scale motions plays a critical role.</description>

      <title>Spatial dynamics of flexible nano-swimmers under a rotating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-nano-robotic swimmers have promising potential for future biomedical tasks such as targeted drug delivery and minimally-invasive diagnosis. An efficient method for controlled actuation of such nano-swimmers is applying a rotating external magnetic field, resulting in helical corkscrew-like locomotion. In previous joint work, we presented fabrication and actuation of a simple magnetic nano-swimmer composed of two nano-rods connected by a short elastic hinge. Experiments under different actuation frequencies result in different motion regimes. At low frequencies, in-plane tumbling; at higher frequencies, moving forward in a spatial helical path in synchrony with the rotating magnetic field; in further frequency increase, asynchronous swimming is obtained. In this work, we present mathematical analysis of this nano-swimmer motion. We consider a simple two-link model and explicitly formulate and analyze its nonlinear dynamic equations, and reduce them to a simpler time-invariant system. For the first time, we obtain explicit analytic solutions of synchronous motion under simplifying assumptions, for both solutions of in-plane tumbling and spatial helical swimming. We conduct stability analysis of the solutions, presenting stability transitions and bifurcations for the different solution branches. Furthermore, we present analysis of the influence of additional effects, as well as parametric optimization of the swimmer's speed. The results of our theoretical study are essential for understanding the nonlinear dynamics of experimental magnetic nano-swimmers for biomedical applications, and conducting practical optimization of their performance.</description>

      <title>Scale-by-scale energy transfers in bubbly flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable density buoyancy-driven bubbly flows allow for multiple definitions of scale-dependent (or filtered) energy. A priori, it is not obvious which of these provide the most physically apt scale-by-scale budget. In the present study, we compare two such definitions, based on (a) filtered momentum and filtered velocity (Pandey et al., 2020), and (b) Favre filtered energy (Aluie 2013, Pandey et al., 2023). We also derive a K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin (KHM) relation using the momentum-velocity correlation function and contrast it with the scale-by-scale energy budget obtained in (a). We find that irrespective of the definition, the mechanism of energy transfer is identical for the advective nonlinearity and surface tension. However, a careful investigation reveals that depending on the definition, either buoyancy or pressure can lead to transfer of energy from a scale corresponding to the bubble diameter to larger scales.</description>

      <title>Interface Fragmentation via Horizontal Vibration: A Pathway to Scalable Monodisperse Emulsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for producing monodisperse microscale emulsions in a container holding two stably stratified layers of immiscible liquids by applying horizontal vibration. Our experiments and theoretical modelling show that the critical non-dimensional acceleration for regular droplet formation is governed by a shear-dominated breakup mechanism, which scales as $N^{-1/2} \omega^{*3/2}$, where $N$ is the viscosity ratio and $\omega^{*}$ is the frequency of forcing on the viscous-capillary scale. The droplet diameter can be easily controlled by varying the forcing parameters, thus demonstrating this vibrational configuration as a scalable alternative to microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation Exchange between Nanoparticles Heated by Arc Discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heating of particles by plasma radiation plays a critical role in space science involving dusty plasma as well as in industrial processes such as plasma vapor deposition, microchip production, etching and plasma fusion. Numerical modeling of radiation heat transfer from plasma to nano-scale particles includes exchange of scattered thermal radiation between particles-an effect that was neglected in prior studies in which temperature of particles was estimated. Thermal modeling of gas loaded with nanoparticles differs from a typical multiphase flow, where particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas. In contrast, the temperature of nanoparticles heated by radiation is significantly higher than the local gas temperature. The nanoparticles volume heating by radiation is markedly different from conventional surface heating experience by macroscale particles. The larger particles are heated to higher temperatures than smaller ones. The study includes numerical modeling of thermal radiation scattered by particles in the Rayleigh regime in where particles radii are much smaller compared to the radiation wavelength and the distance between particles is larger than the dominant radiation wavelength. The study investigates the effects of reduction in convection heat flux by reducing the gas pressure and using alternating noble gases. Additionally, it investigates the role of enhancement of radiation heat flux from the arc. The computational results show that the re-radiation by larger, heated nanoparticles is important to obtain the accurate temperature of particles. This inter-particle thermal interaction leads to higher temperatures in smaller particles than models assuming thermally isolated particles would predict.</description>

      <title>A Two-Phase Deep Learning Framework for Adaptive Time-Stepping in High-Speed Flow Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of modeling high-speed flows using machine learning methods. While most prior studies focus on low-speed fluid flows in which uniform time-stepping is practical, flows approaching and exceeding the speed of sound exhibit sudden changes such as shock waves. In such cases, it is essential to use adaptive time-stepping methods to allow a temporal resolution sufficient to resolve these phenomena while simultaneously balancing computational costs. Here, we propose a two-phase machine learning method, known as ShockCast, to model high-speed flows with adaptive time-stepping. In the first phase, we propose to employ a machine learning model to predict the timestep size. In the second phase, the predicted timestep is used as an input along with the current fluid fields to advance the system state by the predicted timestep. We explore several physically-motivated components for timestep prediction and introduce timestep conditioning strategies inspired by neural ODE and Mixture of Experts. As ShockCast is the first framework for learning high-speed flows, we evaluate our methods by generating two supersonic flow datasets, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/divelab. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).</description>

      <title>Review of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics And Statistical Mechanics of Vortex Gases in Tornado Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work puts into mathematical, statistical mechanical, and thermodynamical context the initial stages of the genesis of tornado-like vortices with the aim to be consistent with the current state of knowledge of the process of tornadogenesis. In particular, it discusses a mathematical foundation of the formation of coherent structures such as ``cusps'' and ``hairpins'' using variants of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that arise via the Hasimoto transform of a vortex filament model. The behavior of such structures is then analyzed within a quasi-two-dimensional boundary layer model using the statistical mechanics of vortex gases to explain the rearrangement of cusps and other vertical vortex filaments into patches and possibly supercritical vortices. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is used to obtain the entropic balance and the internal entropy production rate, and connect them to the turbulent heat flux. A formula for the non-equilibrium turbulent heat supply and formulas for the entropy supply and entropy production in the boundary layer are also provided. A relationship between the vorticity and the entropy gradient based on macroscopic fluctuations is given with implications to stretching and tilting of vorticity in the vertical direction. We conclude with some remarks on equivalence of Schr\"odinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations in describing vortex filaments.</description>

      <title>Turbulence modeling over riblets via domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing potential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering skin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface corrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the governing equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of rough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to effectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify the influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce established drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility and computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a domain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation analysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain transformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate boundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes at high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the dimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully predicts drag reduction trends for triangular and scalloped riblets, consistent with existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow mechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with friction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of K-H rollers over large and sharp scalloped riblets, contributing to the degradation of drag reduction in these geometries. Additionally, we examine the impact of riblets on near-wall flow structures, focusing on their suppression of streamwise-elongated structures in flows over large riblets.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of discrete Boltzmann simulation for supersonic flows: Influencing factors, coupling mechanisms and optimization strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersonic flow simulations face challenges in trans-scale modeling, numerical stability, and complex field analysis due to inherent nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and multiscale characteristics. The discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) provides a multiscale kinetic modeling framework and analysis tool to capture complex discrete/nonequilibrium effects. While the numerical scheme plays a fundamental role in DBM simulations, a comprehensive stability analysis remains lacking. Similar to LBM, complexity mainly lies in the intrinsic coupling between velocity and spatiotemporal discretizations, compared with CFD. This study conducts von Neumann stability analysis to investigate key factors influencing DBM simulation stability, including phase-space discretization, thermodynamic nonequilibrium (TNE) levels, spatiotemporal schemes, initial conditions, and model parameters. Key findings include: (i) the moment-matching approach outperforms the expansion- and weighting-based methods in the test simulations; (ii) increased TNE enhances system nonlinearity and the intrinsic nonlinearity embedded in the model equations, amplifying instabilities; (iii) additional viscous dissipation based on distribution functions improves stability but distorts flow fields and alters constitutive relations; (iv) larger CFL numbers and relative time steps degrade stability, necessitating appropriate time-stepping strategies. To assess the stability regulation capability of DBMs across TNE levels, stability-phase diagrams and probability curves are constructed via morphological analysis within the moment-matching framework. These diagrams identify common stable parameter regions across model orders. This study reveals key factors and coupling mechanisms affecting DBM stability and proposes strategies for optimizing equilibrium distribution discretization, velocity design, and parameter selection in supersonic regimes.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Metastable Turbulence in Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The onset of turbulence in pipe flow has been a fundamental challenge in physics, applied mathematics, and engineering for over 140 years. To date, the precursor of this laminar-turbulent transition is recognized as transient turbulent spots or puffs, but their defining characteristics - longevity, abrupt relaminarization, and super-exponential lifetime scaling - have been lack of first-principles explanations. By combining extensive computer simulations, theory, and verifications with experimental data, we identify distinct puff relaminarizations separated by a critical Reynolds number, which are defined by a noisy saddle-node bifurcation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Below the critical number, the mean lifetime of puff follows a square-root scaling law, representing an intrinsically deterministic decay dominated by the critical slowing down. Above the critical value, the bifurcation's node branch creates a potential well stabilizing the turbulence, while the saddle branch mediates stochastic barrier-crossing events that drive memoryless decay - a hallmark of metastable states. Accordingly, the mean lifetimes are solved theoretically and can be fitted super-exponentially. By quantifying the deterministic and stochastic components in the kinetic energy equation, the lifetime statistics of puff are analyzed in a unified framework across low-to-moderate Reynolds number regimes, uncovering the mechanisms governing the transition to metastable turbulence in pipe flows.</description>

      <title>A unified quaternion-complex framework for Navier-Stokes equations: new insights and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel, unified quaternion-complex framework for formulating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that reveals the geometric structure underlying viscous fluid motion and resolves the Clay Institute's Millennium Prize problem. By introducing complex coordinates $z = x + iy$ and expressing the velocity field as $F = u + iv$, we demonstrate that the nonlinear convection terms decompose as $(u \cdot \nabla)F = F \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} + F^* \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial \bar{z}}$, separating inviscid convection from viscous coupling effects. We extend this framework to three dimensions using quaternions and prove global regularity through geometric constraints inherent in quaternion algebra. The incompressibility constraint naturally emerges as a requirement that $\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}$ be purely imaginary, linking fluid mechanics to complex analysis fundamentally. Our main result establishes that quaternion orthogonality relations prevent finite-time singularities by ensuring turbulent energy cascade remains naturally bounded. The quaternion-complex formulation demonstrates that turbulence represents breakdown of quaternion-analyticity while maintaining geometric stability, providing rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding why real fluids exhibit finite turbulent behavior rather than mathematical singularities. We prove that for any smooth initial data, there exists a unique global smooth solution to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, directly resolving the Clay Institute challenge. Applications to atmospheric boundary layer physics demonstrate immediate practical relevance for environmental modeling, weather prediction, and climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Improved adjoint lattice Boltzmann method for topology optimization of laminar convective heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving flow-related inverse problems such as topology optimization problems is intricate but significant in various engineering fields. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the related adjoint method are highly suitable to perform sensitivity analysis in flow-related inverse problems thanks to their strong capability to handle complex structures and excellent parallel scalability. However, the current continuous adjoint LBM shows theoretical inconsistency and poor numerical stability for open flow systems. To solve these issues, the present work develops the fully consistent adjoint boundary conditions from the discrete adjoint LBM. For the first time, the gap between the two adjoint LBMs is unveiled by rigorously deriving both the continuous and discrete adjoint LBMs and comprehensively evaluating their numerical performances in the 2D and 3D pipe bend optimization cases. It is revealed that theoretical inconsistency or singularity exists in the continuous adjoint boundary conditions for open flow systems, corresponding to a much inferior numerical stability of the adjoint solution and an obvious numerical error in sensitivity. Fully consistent adjoint boundary conditions in elegant local form are derived from the discrete adjoint LBM in this work, which can always acquire exact sensitivity results and the theoretically highest numerical stability, with a 10 times higher Reynolds number (Re) achieved while without any increase of computational cost. 3D microchannel heat sinks under various Re are designed, and the esthetic and physically reasonable optimized designs are obtained under various parameter settings, demonstrating the necessity and versatility of the presented discrete adjoint LBM.</description>

      <title>Energetically consistent localised APE budgets for local and regional studies of stratified flow energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because it allows a rigorous separation between reversible and irreversible processes, the concept of available potential energy (APE) has become central to the study of turbulent stratified fluids. In ocean modelling, it is fundamental to the parameterisation of meso-scale ocean eddies and of the turbulent mixing of heat and salt. However, how to apply APE theory consistently to local or regional subdomains has been a longstanding source of confusion due to the globally defined Lorenz reference state entering the definition of APE and of buoyancy forces being generally thought to be meaningless in those cases. In practice, this is often remedied by introducing heuristic `localised' forms of APE density depending uniquely on region-specific reference states, possibly diverging significantly from the global Lorenz reference state. In this paper, we argue that across-scale energy transfers can only be consistently described if localised forms of APE density are defined as the eddy APE component of an exact mean/eddy decomposition of the APE density, for which a new physically more intuitive and mathematically simpler framework is proposed. The eddy APE density thus defined exhibits a much weaker dependency on the global Lorenz reference state than the mean APE, in agreement with physical intuition, but with a different structure than that of existing heuristic localised APE forms. Our framework establishes a rigorous physical basis for linking parameterised energy transfers to molecular viscous and diffusive dissipation rates. We illustrate its potential usefulness by discussing the energetics implications of standard advective and diffusive parameterisations of the turbulent density flux, which reveals potential new sources of numerical instability in ocean models.</description>

      <title>Elastic displacements and viscous flows in wedge-shaped geometries with a straight edge: Green's functions for perpendicular forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edges are abundant when elastic solids glide in guiding rails or fluids are contained in vessels. We here address induced displacements in elastic solids or small-scale flows in viscous fluids in the vicinity of one such edge. For this purpose, we solve the governing elasticity equations for linearly elastic, potentially compressible solids, as well as the low-Reynolds-number flow equations for incompressible fluids. Technically speaking, we derive the associated Green's functions under confinement by two planar boundaries that meet at a straight edge. The two boundaries both feature no-slip or free-slip conditions, or one of these two conditions per boundary. Previously, we solved the simpler case of the force being oriented parallel to the straight edge. Here, we complement this solution by the more challenging case of the force pointing into a direction perpendicular to the edge. Together, these two cases provide the general solution. Specific situations in which our analysis may find application in terms of quantitative theoretical descriptions are particle motion in confined colloidal suspensions, dynamics of active microswimmers near edges, or actuated distortions of elastic materials due to activated contained functionalized particles.</description>

      <title>Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction Dynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Immersed Boundary Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce neural network architectures that combine physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the immersed boundary method (IBM) to solve fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. Our approach features two distinct architectures: a Single-FSI network with a unified parameter space, and an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian network that maintains separate parameter spaces for fluid and structure domains. We study each architecture using standard Tanh and adaptive B-spline activation functions. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that the Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture performs significantly better. The adaptive B-spline activation further enhances accuracy by providing locality-aware representation near boundaries. While our methodology shows promising results in predicting the velocity field, pressure recovery remains challenging due to the absence of explicit force-coupling constraints in the current formulation. Our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific architectural design and adaptive activation functions for modeling FSI problems within the PINN framework.</description>

      <title>Turb-L1: Achieving Long-term Turbulence Tracing By Tackling Spectral Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications. However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle. Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$ compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity. (II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions, thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in other methods.</description>

      <title>Resonance-Driven Intermittency and Extreme Events in Turbulent Scalar Transport with a Mean Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>
