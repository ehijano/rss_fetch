      <title>Extending Adams' theorem from singly generated to periodic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960, J.F. Adams introduced secondary cohomology operations that are defined on cohomology elements on which sufficiently many Steenrod algebra elements vanish. This led to his theorem on singly generated cohomology rings, which in turn led to his celebrated resolution of the Hopf invariant one problem. Here we advertise a conjecture that would extend Adams' result and prove it in a special case.</description>

      <title>On the Bauer--Furuta construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the six-functor formalism for sheaves of spectra on topological spaces, we provide a novel construction of the Bauer--Furuta invariant, as well as its family version. This approach avoids the conventional arguments based on approximations by finite-dimensional subspaces, and we instead employ the Borel--Moore homology spectra relative to Fredholm maps between Banach spaces. A key observation here is that $C^1$-differentiable Fredholm maps between Banach manifolds are locally proper, thereby defining the shriek functors, whose dualizing objects may be described as the Thom spectra of the Atiyah--Singer families index.
  We also outline a possible candidate for the stable homotopy theory of genuine equivariant sheaves on topological spaces with Lie group actions. In this context, we investigate the proper pushforward functor, which accommodates the genuine equivariant Bauer--Furuta invariant.</description>

      <title>The $S_\bullet$-construction as an equivalence between 2-Segal spaces and stable augmented double Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is a contribution for a proceedings volume of the workshop "Higher Segal Spaces and their Applications to Algebraic K-Theory, Hall Algebras, and Combinatorics". The content is a streamlined exposition based on a talk about a result by Bergner-Osorno-Ozornova-Rovelli-Scheimbauer from WITII. We discuss how a generalized version of Waldhausen's S-construction describes a correspondence between 2-Segal spaces and certain double Segal spaces, which satisfy further conditions of stability and augmentation.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Lifting relations in right orderable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the following problem: given a chain complex $A_*$ of free $\mathbb{Z}G$-modules, when is $A_*$ isomorphic to the cellular chain complex of some simply connected $G$-CW-complex? Such a chain complex is called realisable. Wall studied this problem in the 60's and reduced it to a problem involving only the second differential $d_2$, now known as the relation lifting problem. We show that if $G$ is right orderable and $d_2$ is given by a matrix of a certain form, then $A_*$ is realisable. As a special case, we solve the relation lifting problem for right orderable groups with cyclic relation module.</description>

      <title>Deformations and homotopy theory of Nijenhuis associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of works devoted to an operadic study of Nijenhuis structures, focusing on Nijenhuis associative algebras. We introduce the concept of homotopy Nijenhuis associative algebras and demonstrate that the differential graded (=dg) operad $\NjAoperad_{\infty}$ governing these structures serves as the minimal model of the operad $\NjAoperad$ for Nijenhuis associative algebras. Additionally, we determine the Koszul dual homotopy cooperad of $\NjAoperad$. We construct an $L_\infty$-algebra that controls the simultaneous deformations of associative products and Nijenhuis operators. The Maurer-Cartan elements of this $L_\infty$-algebra correspond bijectively to Nijenhuis associative algebra structures. From this, we derive a cochain complex (deformation complex) and an associated cohomology theory of Nijenhuis associative algebras. Finally, we explore the connection between homotopy relative Rota-Baxter associative algebras of weight $0$ and homotopy Nijenhuis associative algebras. A sequel to this work will extend the study to Nijenhuis Lie algebras, with applications to Nijenhuis geometry.</description>

      <title>Line Graph Vietoris-Rips Persistence Diagram for Topological Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While message passing graph neural networks result in informative node embeddings, they may suffer from describing the topological properties of graphs. To this end, node filtration has been widely used as an attempt to obtain the topological information of a graph using persistence diagrams. However, these attempts have faced the problem of losing node embedding information, which in turn prevents them from providing a more expressive graph representation. To tackle this issue, we shift our focus to edge filtration and introduce a novel edge filtration-based persistence diagram, named Topological Edge Diagram (TED), which is mathematically proven to preserve node embedding information as well as contain additional topological information. To implement TED, we propose a neural network based algorithm, named Line Graph Vietoris-Rips (LGVR) Persistence Diagram, that extracts edge information by transforming a graph into its line graph. Through LGVR, we propose two model frameworks that can be applied to any message passing GNNs, and prove that they are strictly more powerful than Weisfeiler-Lehman type colorings. Finally we empirically validate superior performance of our models on several graph classification and regression benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Projective model structures on diffeological spaces and smooth sets and the smooth Oka principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we prove that the category of diffeological spaces does not admit a model structure transferred via the smooth singular complex functor from simplicial sets, resolving in the negative a conjecture of Christensen and Wu, in contrast to Kihara's model structure on diffeological spaces constructed using a different singular complex functor. Next, motivated by applications in quantum field theory and topology, we embed diffeological spaces into sheaves of sets (not necessarily concrete) on the site of smooth manifolds and study the proper combinatorial model structure on such sheaves transferred via the smooth singular complex functor from simplicial sets. We show the resulting model category to be Quillen equivalent to the model category of simplicial sets. We then show that this model structure is cartesian, all smooth manifolds are cofibrant, and establish the existence of model structures on categories of algebras over operads. Finally, we use these results to establish analogous properties for model structures on simplicial presheaves on smooth manifolds, as well as presheaves valued in left proper combinatorial model categories, and prove a generalization of the smooth Oka principle established in arXiv:1912.10544. We apply these results to establish classification theorems for differential-geometric objects like closed differential forms, principal bundles with connection, and higher bundle gerbes with connection on arbitrary cofibrant diffeological spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a structure on a commutative ring (pre)cyclotomic spectrum $R$ that gives rise to a (pre)cyclotomic structure on topological Hochschild homology ($THH$) relative to its underlying commutative ring spectrum. This lets us construct $TC$ relative to $R$, denoted $TC^{R}$, and we prove some descent results relating $TC^{R}$ and $TC$. We explore several examples of this structure on familiar $\mathbb{T}$-equivariant commutative ring spectra including the periodic $\mathbb{T}$-equivariant complex cobordism spectrum $MUP_{\mathbb{T}}$ and a new (connective) equivariant version of the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology Without Open Sets: A Net Approach to Homotopy Theory in Limit Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergence spaces are a generalization of topological spaces. The category of convergence spaces is well-suited for Algebraic Topology, one of the reasons is the existence of exponential objects provided by continuous convergence. In this work, we use a net-theoretic approach to convergence spaces. The goal is to simplify the description of continuous convergence and apply it to problems related to homotopy theory. We present methods to develop the basis of homotopy theory in limit spaces, define the fundamental groupoid, and prove the groupoid version of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for limit spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a project aimed at formalizing Rozansky-Witten models in the functorial field theory framework. Motivated by work of Calaque-Haugseng-Scheimbauer, we construct a family of symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-categories parametrized by an $\infty$-category with finite limits and a functor into symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories, such that the functor admits pushforwards. This $(\infty,3)$-category contains correspondences in the base $\infty$-category equipped with local systems, which compose via a push-pull formula. We apply this general construction to provide an approximation to the $3$-category of Rozansky-Witten models whose existence was conjectured by Kapustin-Rozansky-Saulina; this approximation behaves like a "commutative" version of the conjectured $3$-category and is related to work of Stefanich on higher quasicoherent sheaves.</description>
