      <title>On Translating Epistemic Operators in a Logic of Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Awareness-Based Indistinguishability Logic (henceforth, AIL) is an extension of Epistemic Logic by introducing the notion of awareness, distinguishing explicit knowledge from implicit knowledge. In this framework, each of these notions is represented by a modal operator. On the other hand, HMS models, developed in the economics literature, also provide a formalization of those notions. Nevertheless, the behavior of the epistemic operators in AIL within HMS models has yet to be explored. In this paper, we define a transformation of an AIL model into an HMS model and then prove that a translation between the fragments of the language of AIL preserves truth under this transformation. As a result, we clarify the semantic role of an epistemic operator in AIL, which is induced by awareness and is essential to defining explicit knowledge, within HMS models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the differences in the implicit knowledge captured by AIL and HMS models. This work lays the groundwork for a comparative analysis between the model classes.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy Theorem for Automatic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) studies homomorphism problems between relational structures where the target structure is fixed. Classifying the complexity of these problems has been a central quest of the field, notably when both sides are finite structures. In this paper, we study the generalization where the input is an automatic structure -- potentially infinite, but describable by finite automata. We prove a striking dichotomy: homomorphism problems over automatic structures are either decidable in non-deterministic logarithmic space (NL), or undecidable. We show that structures for which the problem is decidable are exactly those with finite duality, which is a classical property of target structures asserting that the existence of a homomorphism into them can be characterized by the absence of a finite set of obstructions in the source structure. Notably, this property precisely characterizes target structures whose homomorphism problem is definable in first-order logic, which is well-known to be decidable over automatic structures. We also consider a natural variant of the problem. While automatic structures are finitely describable, homomorphisms from them into finite structures need not be. This leads to the notion of regular homomorphism, where the homomorphism itself must be describable by finite automata. Remarkably, we prove that this variant exhibits the same dichotomy, with the same characterization for decidability.</description>

      <title>On the Category-Theoretic Independence of Meaning, Object, Name and Existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a category-theoretic independence theorem for four fundamental notions: meaning, object, name, and existence. Working in a Lawvere-style categorical semantics and in particular in toposes, we show that these notions occupy distinct structural levels (object, morphism, element, and internal logical level) and are not uniformly recoverable from one another.
  The key separation arises between internal existence and global naming. Using a concrete example in the topos $\mathbf{Sh}(S^1)$-the sheaf of local sections of a nontrivial covering-we exhibit an object that is internally inhabited but admits no global element.
  These results provide a precise structural basis for treating geometric universes as foundational frameworks for information networks.</description>

      <title>Complexity lower bounds for succinct binary structures of bounded clique-width with restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Rice-like complexity lower bound for any MSO-definable problem on binary structures succinctly encoded by circuits. This work extends the framework recently developed as a counterpoint to Courcelle's theorem for graphs encoded by circuits, in two interplaying directions: (1) by allowing multiple binary relations, and (2) by restricting the interpretation of new symbols. Depending on the pair of an MSO problem $\psi$ and an MSO restriction $\chi$, the problem is proven to be NP-hard or coNP-hard or P-hard, as long as $\psi$ is non-trivial on structures satisfying $\chi$ with bounded clique-width. Indeed, there are P-complete problems (for logspace reductions) in our extended context. Finally, we strengthen a previous result on the necessity to parameterize the notion of non-triviality, hence supporting the choice of clique-width.</description>

      <title>Towards a Higher-Order Bialgebraic Denotational Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bialgebraic abstract GSOS framework by Turi and Plotkin provides an elegant categorical approach to modelling the operational and denotational semantics of programming and process languages. In abstract GSOS, bisimilarity is always a congruence, and it coincides with denotational equivalence. This saves the language designer from intricate, ad-hoc reasoning to establish these properties. The bialgebraic perspective on operational semantics in the style of abstract GSOS has recently been extended to higher-order languages, preserving compositionality of bisimilarity. However, a categorical understanding of bialgebraic denotational semantics according to Turi and Plotkin's original vision has so far been missing in the higher-order setting. In the present paper, we develop a theory of adequate denotational semantics in higher-order abstract GSOS. The denotational models are parametric in an appropriately chosen semantic domain in the form of a locally final coalgebra for a behaviour bifunctor, whose construction is fully decoupled from the syntax of the language. Our approach captures existing accounts of denotational semantics such as semantic domains built via general step-indexing, previously introduced on a per-language basis, and is shown to be applicable to a wide range of different higher-order languages, e.g. simply typed and untyped languages, or languages with computational effects such as probabilistic or non-deterministic branching.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy for Axiomatising Inclusion Dependencies on K-Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relation consisting of tuples annotated by an element of a monoid K is called a K-relation. A K-database is a collection of K-relations. In this paper, we study entailment of inclusion dependencies over K-databases, where K is a positive commutative monoid. We establish a dichotomy regarding the axiomatisation of the entailment of inclusion dependencies over K-databases, based on whether the monoid K is weakly absorptive or weakly cancellative. We establish that, if the monoid is weakly cancellative then the standard axioms of inclusion dependencies are sound and complete for the implication problem. If the monoid is not weakly cancellative, it is weakly absorptive and the standard axioms of inclusion dependencies together with the weak symmetry axiom are sound and complete for the implication problem. In addition, we establish that the so-called balance axiom is further required, if one stipulates that the joint weights of each K-relation of a K-database need to be the same; this generalises the notion of a K-relation being a distribution. In conjunction with the balance axiom, weak symmetry axiom boils down to symmetry.</description>

      <title>Unifying approach to uniform expressivity of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often analysed via correspondence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and fragments of first-order logic. Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.</description>

      <title>The Sup Connective in IMALL: A Categorical Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02142v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a proof language for intuitionistic multiplicative additive linear logic, incorporating the sup connective that introduces additive pairs with a probabilistic elimination, and sum and scalar products within the proof-terms. We provide an abstract characterisation of the language, revealing that any symmetric monoidal closed category with biproducts and a monomorphism from the semiring of scalars to the semiring Hom(I,I) is suitable for the job. Leveraging the binary biproducts, we define a weighted codiagonal map which is at the core of the sup connective.</description>

      <title>Groups and Inverse Semigroups in Lambda Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study invertibility of $\lambda$-terms modulo $\lambda$-theories. Here a fundamental role is played by a class of $\lambda$-terms called finite hereditary permutations (FHP) and by their infinite generalisations (HP). More precisely, FHPs are the invertible elements in the least extensional $\lambda$-theory $\lambda \eta$ and HPs are those in the greatest sensible $\lambda$-theory $H^*$. Our approach is based on inverse semigroups, algebraic structures that generalise groups and semilattices. We show that FHP modulo a $\lambda$-theory $T$ is always an inverse semigroup and that HP modulo $T$ is an inverse semigroup whenever $T$ contains the theory of B\"ohm trees. An inverse semigroup comes equipped with a natural order. We prove that the natural order corresponds to $\eta$-expansion in $\mathrm{FHP} /T$, and to infinite $\eta$-expansion in $\mathrm{HP}/T$. Building on these correspondences we obtain the two main contributions of this work: firstly, we recast in a broader framework the results cited at the beginning; secondly, we prove that the FHPs are the invertible $\lambda$-terms in all the $\lambda$-theories lying between $\lambda \eta$ and $H^+$. The latter is Morris' observational $\lambda$-theory, defined by using the $\beta$-normal forms as observables.</description>

      <title>Verifying DNN-based Semantic Communication Against Generative Adversarial Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT are adopting semantic communication (SemCom) systems using deep neural networks to reduce bandwidth and increase transmission speed by transmitting only task-relevant semantic features.
  However, adversarial attacks against these DNN-based SemCom systems can cause catastrophic failures by manipulating transmitted semantic features.
  Existing defense mechanisms rely on empirical approaches provide no formal guarantees against the full spectrum of adversarial perturbations.
  We present VSCAN, a neural network verification framework that provides mathematical robustness guarantees by formulating adversarial noise generation as mixed integer programming and verifying end-to-end properties across multiple interconnected networks (encoder, decoder, and task model).
  Our key insight is that realistic adversarial constraints (power limitations and statistical undetectability) can be encoded as logical formulae to enable efficient verification using state-of-the-art DNN verifiers.
  Our evaluation on 600 verification properties characterizing various attacker's capabilities shows VSCAN matches attack methods in finding vulnerabilities while providing formal robustness guarantees for 44% of properties -- a significant achievement given the complexity of multi-network verification.
  Moreover, we reveal a fundamental security-efficiency tradeoff: compact 16-dimensional latent spaces achieve 50% verified robustness compared to 64-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Machine Space I: Weak exponentials and quantification over compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11339v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology may be interpreted as the study of verifiability, where opens correspond to semi-decidable properties. In this paper we make a distinction between verifiable properties themselves and processes which carry out the verification procedure. The former are simply opens, while we call the latter machines. Given a frame presentation $\mathcal{O} X = \langle G \mid R\rangle$ we construct a space of machines $\Sigma^{\Sigma^G}$ whose points are given by formal combinations of basic machines corresponding to generators in $G$. This comes equipped with an `evaluation' map making it a weak exponential with base $\Sigma$ and exponent $X$.
  When it exists, the true exponential $\Sigma^X$ occurs as a retract of machine space. We argue this helps explain why some spaces are exponentiable and others not. We then use machine space to study compactness by giving a purely topological version of Escard\'o's algorithm for universal quantification over compact spaces in finite time. Finally, we relate our study of machine space to domain theory and domain embeddings.</description>

      <title>FATE: A Formal Benchmark Series for Frontier Algebra of Multiple Difficulty Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</description>
