      <title>Predicting Forecast Error for the HRRR Using LSTM Neural Networks: A Comparative Study Using New York and Oklahoma State Mesonets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are trained to predict forecast error for the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model using the New York State Mesonet and Oklahoma State Mesonet near-surface weather observations as ground truth. Physical and dynamical mechanisms tied to LSTM performance are evaluated by comparing the New York domain to the Oklahoma domain. The contrasting geography and atmospheric dynamics of the two domains provide a compelling scientific foil. Evaluating them side by side highlights variations in LSTM prediction of forecast error that are closely linked to region-specific phenomena driven by both dynamics and geography. Using mean-absolute-error and percent improvement relative to HRRR, LSTMs predict precipitation error most accurately, followed by wind error and then temperature error. Precipitation errors exhibit an asymmetry, with overforecast precipitation detected more accurately than underforecast, while wind error predictions are consistent across over- and underforecast predictions. Temperature error predictions are relatively accurate but smoother, with respect to variance, than true observations. This paper describes an overview of LSTM performance with the expressed intent of providing forecasters with real-time predictions of forecast error at the point of use within the New York State and Oklahoma State Mesonets. This research demonstrates the potential of LSTM-based machine learning models to provide actionable, location-specific predictions of forecast error for high-resolution operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of Climate Change on Moroccan Coastal Upwelling: Relationships between the NAO, Upwelling Index, and Sea Surface Temperature (1978-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates climate change impacts on Moroccan Atlantic coastal upwelling (21$^{\circ}$--35$^{\circ}$N), analyzing interrelationships among the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Coastal Upwelling Index (CUI), and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from 1978--2024 using ERA5 reanalysis data. Methods include index calculations, seasonal correlations, Granger causality tests, linear trends, and breakpoint detection to evaluate spatio-temporal dynamics and causality. Results reveal seasonal variability: strong NAO--CUI coupling in winter (DJF; $r = +0.65$), local upwelling dominance in summer (JJA; $r = -0.46$ CUI--SST), and a north--south gradient with intense southern upwelling (mean Ekman transport $37.1 \pm 34.5$ m$^3$/s/100m). Trends show significant SST warming ($+0.0736$ units/decade; $+0.149^{\circ}$C/decade spatially), summer upwelling decline ($-0.0635$ units/decade in JJA), and weak NAO shifts. Granger causality indicates rapid local forcing (CUI $\to$ SST, lag 1--3 months), delayed teleconnections (NAO $\to$ SST, lag 2--4 months), and ocean feedback (SST $\to$ NAO, lag 7--11 months). Breakpoints (1992--1997) signal warming acceleration, highlighting a paradox of global SST rise amid localized upwelling-induced cooling per Bakun's hypothesis. Findings underscore implications for fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism, advocating adaptive management via seasonal forecasting. Keywords: Coastal upwelling, NAO, SST, climate change, Granger causality, Moroccan Atlantic, Ekman transport, spatio-temporal variability.</description>

      <title>Huayu: Advanced Real-Time Precipitation Estimation from Geostationary Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As climate change drives increased frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation and flooding worldwide, posing escalating threats to public safety and economic assets, accurate and real-time satellite-based precipitation estimation is essential for operational large-scale hydrometeorological analysis and disaster monitoring. NASA's Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG Final Run) combines information from "all" satellite microwave observations with gauge correction and climatological adjustment to produce precipitation estimates at 0.1{\deg} spatial and 30-min temporal resolution. However, its latency of approximately 3.5 months restricts its utility for real-time applications, despite outperforming mainstream satellite precipitation datasets in representing rainfall patterns and variability. We present Huayu, a novel machine learning-based real-time satellite precipitation retrieval system that relies solely on infrared observations from the FengYun-4B geostationary satellite to provide a more accurate precipitation estimate at a finer spatiotemporal resolution (15 min, 0.05{\deg}) over a 120{\deg} by 120{\deg} domain. Performance evaluations demonstrate that Huayu achieves strong consistency with rain gauge observations, yielding a critical success index (CSI) of 0.693 - representing a 3.43% improvement over IMERG Final Run (CSI: 0.670). Experimental results confirm that infrared satellite observations can deliver more accurate precipitation estimates than conventional multi-source algorithms.</description>

      <title>The spatial organization of wind turbine wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind turbine wakes play a central role in determining wind farm performance, yet their spatial organization remains only partially understood. Here, we apply a spatially localized multifractal analysis to quantify the strength of dependencies (local roughness) and extreme velocity fluctuations (local intermittency) in turbine wakes, and relate these properties to established metrics in wind energy research. Using two-dimensional nacelle-mounted LiDAR plan-position-indicator scans, we extract scale-invariant features that enable systematic comparisons across the wake without requiring time-resolved data. Designed to robustly handle irregular sampling, our analysis yields four main findings: i.) Four distinct wake zones are identified, each exhibiting unique patterns of roughness and intermittency. ii.) Coherent, strongly correlated patches emerge 2 to 5 rotor diameters D downstream, with intermittency strengthening periodically at multiple D positions and along the wake-free-flow interface. iii.) The classical "intermittency ring" is consequently redefined as a set of localized "intermittency bubbles", iv.) which interact dynamically with the ambient atmosphere through an inverse energy cascade, transferring energy from small to large scales. These findings, supported by concurrent cup anemometer observations under free-inflow conditions, demonstrate that local multifractal analysis provides a robust and cost-effective diagnostic framework for wake characterization and wake-model validation, with direct relevance for wind-farm design and control.</description>

      <title>Setting the Standard: Recommended Practices for Data Preprocessing in Data-Driven Climate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) - and specifically machine learning (ML) - applications for climate prediction across timescales are proliferating quickly. The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data preprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional statistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill and confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly influenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model development, thus yielding the colloquialism, "garbage in, garbage out." As such, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input data for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to decadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers, developers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate predictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such applications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are using are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in this article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with non-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data, and handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex distributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing techniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can create confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately, implementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies.</description>
