      <title>Multi-Loss Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition with Energy-Adaptive Mixup and Frame-Level Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important technology in human-computer interaction. However, achieving high performance is challenging due to emotional complexity and scarce annotated data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-loss learning (MLL) framework integrating an energy-adaptive mixup (EAM) method and a frame-level attention module (FLAM). The EAM method leverages SNR-based augmentation to generate diverse speech samples capturing subtle emotional variations. FLAM enhances frame-level feature extraction for multi-frame emotional cues. Our MLL strategy combines Kullback-Leibler divergence, focal, center, and supervised contrastive loss to optimize learning, address class imbalance, and improve feature separability. We evaluate our method on four widely used SER datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, RAVDESS, and SAVEE. The results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting its effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>RRPO: Robust Reward Policy Optimization for LLM-based Emotional TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks like DiffRO offer a powerful approach for controllable text-to-speech (TTS), but are vulnerable to reward hacking, particularly for nuanced tasks like emotion control. The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

      <title>Standard audiogram classification from loudness scaling data using unsupervised, supervised, and explainable machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the calibration and procedural challenges inherent in remote audiogram assessment for rehabilitative audiology, this study investigated whether calibration-independent adaptive categorical loudness scaling (ACALOS) data can be used to approximate individual audiograms by classifying listeners into standard Bisgaard audiogram types using machine learning. Three classes of machine learning approaches - unsupervised, supervised, and explainable - were evaluated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to extract the first two principal components, which together explained more than 50 percent of the variance. Seven supervised multi-class classifiers were trained and compared, alongside unsupervised and explainable methods. Model development and evaluation used a large auditory reference database containing ACALOS data (N = 847). The PCA factor map showed substantial overlap between listeners, indicating that cleanly separating participants into six Bisgaard classes based solely on their loudness patterns is challenging. Nevertheless, the models demonstrated reasonable classification performance, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy among supervised approaches. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can predict standard Bisgaard audiogram types, within certain limits, from calibration-independent loudness perception data, supporting potential applications in remote or resource-limited settings without requiring a traditional audiogram.</description>

      <title>Large Speech Model Enabled Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing speech semantic communication systems mainly based on Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) architectures have demonstrated impressive performance, but their effectiveness remains limited by model structures specifically designed for particular tasks and datasets. Recent advances indicate that generative large models pre-trained on massive datasets, can achieve outstanding performance arexhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large models and enable adaptive transmission over lossy channels, we propose a Large Speech Model enabled Semantic Communication (LargeSC) system. Simultaneously achieving adaptive compression and robust transmission over lossy channels remains challenging, requiring trade-offs among compression efficiency, speech quality, and latency. In this work, we employ the Mimi as a speech codec, converting speech into discrete tokens compatible with existing network architectures. We propose an adaptive controller module that enables adaptive transmission and in-band Unequal Error Protection (UEP), dynamically adjusting to both speech content and packet loss probability under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the Moshi foundation model for generative recovery of lost speech tokens. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports bandwidths ranging from 550 bps to 2.06 kbps, outperforms conventional baselines in speech quality under high packet loss rates and achieves an end-to-end latency of approximately 460 ms, thereby demonstrating its potential for real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>M3-TTS: Multi-modal DiT Alignment &amp; Mel-latent for Zero-shot High-fidelity Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-autoregressive (NAR) text-to-speech synthesis relies on length alignment between text sequences and audio representations, constraining naturalness and expressiveness. Existing methods depend on duration modeling or pseudo-alignment strategies that severely limit naturalness and computational efficiency. We propose M3-TTS, a concise and efficient NAR TTS paradigm based on multi-modal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT) architecture. M3-TTS employs joint diffusion transformer layers for cross-modal alignment, achieving stable monotonic alignment between variable-length text-speech sequences without pseudo-alignment requirements. Single diffusion transformer layers further enhance acoustic detail modeling. The framework integrates a mel-vae codec that provides 3* training acceleration. Experimental results on Seed-TTS and AISHELL-3 benchmarks demonstrate that M3-TTS achieves state-of-the-art NAR performance with the lowest word error rates (1.36\% English, 1.31\% Chinese) while maintaining competitive naturalness scores. Code and demos will be available at https://wwwwxp.github.io/M3-TTS.</description>

      <title>YingMusic-Singer: Zero-shot Singing Voice Synthesis and Editing with Annotation-free Melody Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) remains constrained in practical deployment due to its strong dependence on accurate phoneme-level alignment and manually annotated melody contours, requirements that are resource-intensive and hinder scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a melody-driven SVS framework capable of synthesizing arbitrary lyrics following any reference melody, without relying on phoneme-level alignment. Our method builds on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, enhanced with a dedicated melody extraction module that derives melody representations directly from reference audio. To ensure robust melody encoding, we employ a teacher model to guide the optimization of the melody extractor, alongside an implicit alignment mechanism that enforces similarity distribution constraints for improved melodic stability and coherence. Additionally, we refine duration modeling using weakly annotated song data and introduce a Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning strategy with a multi-objective reward function to jointly enhance pronunciation clarity and melodic fidelity. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both objective measures and subjective listening tests, especially in zero-shot and lyric adaptation settings, while maintaining high audio quality without manual annotation. This work offers a practical and scalable solution for advancing data-efficient singing voice synthesis. To support reproducibility, we release our inference code and model checkpoints.</description>

      <title>YingMusic-SVC: Real-World Robust Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion with Flow-GRPO and Singing-Specific Inductive Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to render the target singer's timbre while preserving melody and lyrics. However, existing zero-shot SVC systems remain fragile in real songs due to harmony interference, F0 errors, and the lack of inductive biases for singing. We propose YingMusic-SVC, a robust zero-shot framework that unifies continuous pre-training, robust supervised fine-tuning, and Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning. Our model introduces a singing-trained RVC timbre shifter for timbre-content disentanglement, an F0-aware timbre adaptor for dynamic vocal expression, and an energy-balanced rectified flow matching loss to enhance high-frequency fidelity. Experiments on a graded multi-track benchmark show that YingMusic-SVC achieves consistent improvements over strong open-source baselines in timbre similarity, intelligibility, and perceptual naturalness, especially under accompanied and harmony-contaminated conditions, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world SVC deployment.</description>

      <title>Shared Multi-modal Embedding Space for Face-Voice Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FAME 2026 challenge comprises two demanding tasks: training face-voice associations combined with a multilingual setting that includes testing on languages on which the model was not trained. Our approach consists of separate uni-modal processing pipelines with general face and voice feature extraction, complemented by additional age-gender feature extraction to support prediction. The resulting single-modal features are projected into a shared embedding space and trained with an Adaptive Angular Margin (AAM) loss. Our approach achieved first place in the FAME 2026 challenge, with an average Equal-Error Rate (EER) of 23.99%.</description>

      <title>Contract-Driven QoE Auditing for Speech and Singing Services: From MOS Regression to Service Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subjective mean opinion scores (MOS) remain the de-facto target for non-intrusive speech and singing quality assessment. However, MOS is a scalar that collapses heterogeneous user expectations, ignores service-level objectives, and is difficult to compare across deployment graphs. We propose a contract-driven QoE auditing framework: each service graph G is evaluated under a set of human-interpretable experience contracts C, yielding a contract-level satisfaction vector Q(G, C). We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C. We instantiate the framework on URGENT2024 MOS (6.9k speech utterances with raw rating vectors) and SingMOS v1 (7,981 singing clips; 80 systems). On URGENT, we train a contract-aware neural auditor on self-supervised WavLM embeddings; on SingMOS, we perform contract-driven graph auditing using released rating vectors and metadata without decoding audio. Empirically, our auditor matches strong MOS predictors in MOS accuracy while providing calibrated contract probabilities; on SingMOS, Q(G, C) exhibits substantially smaller cross-view drift than raw MOS and graph-only baselines; on URGENT, difficulty curves reveal that mis-specified "simple" contracts can be harder to learn than richer but better aligned contract sets.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Semantic Teachers: Post-Training Alignment for Medical Audio Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained audio models excel at detecting acoustic patterns in auscultation sounds but often fail to grasp their clinical significance, limiting their use and performance in diagnostic tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AcuLa (Audio-Clinical Understanding via Language Alignment), a lightweight post-training framework that instills semantic understanding into any audio encoder by aligning it with a medical language model, which acts as a "semantic teacher." To enable alignment at scale, we construct a large-scale dataset by leveraging off-the-shelf large language models to translate the rich, structured metadata accompanying existing audio recordings into coherent clinical reports. Our alignment strategy combines a representation-level contrastive objective with a self-supervised modeling, ensuring that the model learns clinical semantics while preserving fine-grained temporal cues. AcuLa achieves state-of-the-art results across 18 diverse cardio-respiratory tasks from 10 different datasets, improving the mean AUROC on classification benchmarks from 0.68 to 0.79 and, on the most challenging COVID-19 cough detection task, boosting the AUROC from 0.55 to 0.89. Our work demonstrates that this audio-language alignment transforms purely acoustic models into clinically-aware diagnostic tools, establishing a novel paradigm for enhancing physiological understanding in audio-based health monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Architecture for Multi-instrument Transcription with Practical Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing multi-timbre transcription models struggle with generalization beyond pre-trained instruments, rigid source-count constraints, and high computational demands that hinder deployment on low-resource devices. We address these limitations with a lightweight model that extends a timbre-agnostic transcription backbone with a dedicated timbre encoder and performs deep clustering at the note level, enabling joint transcription and dynamic separation of arbitrary instruments. Practical optimizations including spectral normalization, dilated convolutions, and contrastive clustering further improve efficiency and robustness. Despite its small size and fast inference, the model achieves competitive performance with heavier baselines in transcription accuracy and separation quality, and shows promising generalization ability, making it highly suitable for real-world deployment in practical and resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>MelTok: 2D Tokenization for Single-Codebook Audio Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have emerged with strong performance across diverse audio understanding tasks and can be further enhanced by neural audio codecs. Transitioning from multi-layer residual vector quantizers to a single-layer quantizer has been shown to facilitate more efficient downstream language models decoding. However, the ability of a single codebook to capture fine-grained acoustic details remains limited, as the frequency-variant nature of 1D tokenizers leads to redundancy. To address this issue, we propose MelTok, a two-dimensional (2D) tokenizer that effectively compresses acoustic details of 44.1 KHz audio into a single codebook. The tokenizer encodes audio into a more compact representation than one-dimensional tokenizers. Furthermore, to recover audio from mel-spectrogram tokens, we propose a token-based vocoder. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that MelTok achieves quality comparable to multi-codebook codecs and outperforms existing state-of-the-art neural codecs with a single codebook on high-fidelity audio reconstruction. By preserving acoustic details, MelTok offers a strong representation for downstream understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>Head, posture, and full-body gestures in dyadic conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When face-to-face communication becomes effortful due to background noise and interfering talkers, the role of visual cues becomes increasingly important for communication success. While previous research has selectively investigated head or hand movements, here we explore the combination of movements of head, hand and the whole body in acoustically adverse conditions. We hypothesize that with increasing background noise level, the frequency of typical conversational movements of hand, head, trunk, and legs increases to support the speakers role while the listeners support their role by increased use of confirmative head gestures and head and trunk movements to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We conducted a dyadic conversation experiment in which (n=8) normal hearing participants stood freely in an audiovisual virtual environment. The conversational movements were described by a newly developed labeling system for typical conversational movements, and the frequency of individual types was analyzed. Increased levels of background noise led to increased hand-gesture complexity and modulation of head movements without a clear pattern. People leaned forward slightly more and used less head movements during listening than during speaking. Additional analysis of hand-speech synchrony with hypothesized loss of synchrony due to the background noise showed a modest decrease of synchrony in terms of increased standard deviation at moderate sound levels. The results support previous findings in terms of the gesturing frequency, and we found a limited support for the changes in speech-gesture synchrony. The work reveals communication patterns of the whole body and exemplifies interactive communication in context of multimodal adaptation to communication needs.</description>

      <title>Omni-AutoThink: Adaptive Multimodal Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Omni models have enabled unified multimodal perception and generation. However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.</description>
