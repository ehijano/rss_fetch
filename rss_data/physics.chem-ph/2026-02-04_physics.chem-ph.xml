      <title>Single-run determination of the saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization/sublimation of a substance undergoing successive solid-solid and solid-liquid phase transitions: the case of $N$-methyl acetamide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the dynamical measurement of the saturation vapor pressure of $N$-methyl acetamide in the temperature range $-30^\circ$C to $34^\circ$C. This is achieved by monitoring the pressure inside a vacuum chamber in which a precooled sample of the substance slowly thermalizes to the chamber temperature, undergoing first a phase transition between two crystalline structures around $1^\circ$C and then a solid-liquid phase transition around $30^\circ$C. Such a measurement provides in a single run accurate data for the saturation vapor pressure and the enthalpies of sublimation and vaporization of the different phases of the investigated substance.</description>

      <title>Impact of Local Descriptors Derived from Machine Learning Potentials in Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a framework aimed at enhancing molecular property prediction through the integration of local descriptors obtained from large-scale pretrained machine learning potentials into three-dimensional graph neural networks (3D GNNs). As an illustration, we developed an EGNN-PFP model by integrating descriptors derived from the preferred potential (PFP) features, acquired through Matlantis, into an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN), and evaluated its effectiveness. When tested on the QM9 dataset, comprising small organic molecules, the proposed model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to both the original EGNN models and the baseline models without PFP-derived descriptors for 11 out of the 12 molecular properties. Furthermore, when evaluated on the tmQM dataset, which encompasses transition metal complexes, notable enhancements in performance were observed across all five target properties, indicating the significance of the local atomic environment surrounding transition metals. In essence, the proposed methodology is adaptable to any 3D GNN architecture, and further enhancements in prediction accuracy are anticipated when integrated with continually evolving GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Experimental Quantification of Spin-Phonon Coupling in Molecular Qubits using Inelastic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic spin superposition states enable nanoscale sensing through their sensitivity to the local environment, yet their sensitivity to vibrational motion also limits their coherence times. In molecular spin systems, chemical tunability and atomic-scale resolution are accompanied by a dense, thermally accessible phonon spectrum that introduces efficient spin relaxation pathways. Despite extensive theoretical work, there is little experimental consensus on which vibrational energies dominate spin relaxation or how molecular structure controls spin-phonon coupling (SPC). We present a fully experimental method to quantify SPC coefficients by combining temperature-dependent vibrational spectra from inelastic neutron scattering with spin relaxation rates measured by electron paramagnetic resonance. We apply this framework to two model S = 1/2 systems, copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and copper(II) octaethylporphyrin (CuOEP). Two distinct relaxation regimes emerge: below 40 K, weakly coupled lattice modes below $50~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ dominate, whereas above 40 K, optical phonons above ~$185~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ become thermally populated and drive relaxation with SPC coefficients nearly three orders of magnitude larger. Structural distortions in CuOEP that break planar symmetry soften the crystal lattice and enhance anharmonic scattering, but also raise the energy of stretching modes at the molecular core where the spins reside. This redistributes vibrational energy toward the molecular periphery and out of plane, ultimately reducing SPC relative to CuPc and enabling room-temperature spin coherence in CuOEP. Although our method does not provide mode-specific SPC coefficients, it quantifies contributions from distinct spectral regions and establishes a broadly applicable, fully experimental link between crystal structure, lattice dynamics, and spin relaxation.</description>

      <title>A third law of thermodynamics is an unnecessary complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper elaborates on the implications of the relationship between the Second and Third Laws and provides a comprehensive formal and historical justification for the logical redundancy of the Nernst heat theorem. By revisiting the Nernst-Einstein debate, the underlying hypotheses that lead to the traditional view of the Third Law as an independent postulate are examined. It is argued that the historical rejection of Nernst's proof -- motivated by Einstein's insistence on the practical non-performability of cycles at absolute zero -- overlooks the fact that a universal Second Law already precludes such cycles, rendering an independent Third Law an unnecessary complexity. Ultimately, the Nernst theorem is shown to be an essential consistency regulator rather than an independent physical discovery.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Complex Materials Discovery with Universal Machine-Learning Potential-Driven Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have become powerful tools for accelerating computational materials discovery by replacing expensive first-principles calculations in crystal structure prediction (CSP). However, their effectiveness in identifying new, complex materials remains uncertain. Here, we systematically assess the capability of a uMLIP (i.e.,M3GNet) to accelerate CSP in quaternary oxides. Through extensive exploration of the Sr-Li-Al-O and Ba-Y-Al-O systems, we show that uMLIP can rediscover experimentally known materials absent from its training set and identify seven new thermodynamically and dynamically stable compounds. These include a new polymorph of Sr2LiAlO4 (P3221) and a new disordered phase, Sr2Li4Al2O7 (P1_bar). Furthermore, our results show stability predictions based on the semilocal PBE functional require cross-validation with higher-level methods, such as SCAN and RPA, to ensure reliability. While uMLIPs substantially reduce the computational cost of CSP, the primary bottleneck has shifted to the efficiency of search algorithms in navigating complex structural spaces. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of uMLIP-driven CSP in the discovery of new materials.</description>

      <title>Tensorized orbitals for computational chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choosing a basis set is the first step of a quantum chemistry calculation and it sets its maximum accuracy. This choice of orbitals is limited by strong technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of six dimensional Coulomb integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into ``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, Slater orbitals, linear combination thereof as well as new orbitals beyond the above. Our method provides a path for building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been accessible with previous technology. As an illustration, we construct optimized tensorized orbitals and obtain a 85% reduction of the error on the energy of the $H_2$ molecules with respect to a reference double zeta calculation (cc-pvDz) of the same size.</description>

      <title>Parallelized Givens Ansatz for Molecular ground-states: Bridging Accuracy and Efficiency on NISQ Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as one of the most popular algorithms for solving the electronic structure problem on near-term quantum computers. The utility of VQE is often hindered by the limitations of current quantum hardware, including short qubit coherence times and low gate fidelities. These limitations become particularly pronounced when VQE is used along with deep quantum circuits, such as those required by the "Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles" (UCCSD) ansatz, often resulting in significant errors. To address these issues, we propose a low-depth ansatz based on parallelized Givens rotations, which can recover substantial correlation energy while drastically reducing circuit depth and two-qubit gate counts for an arbitrary active space (AS). Also, considering the current hardware architectures with low qubit counts, we introduce a systematic way to select molecular orbitals to define active spaces (ASs) that retain significant electron correlation. We validate our approach by computing bond dissociation profiles of water and strongly correlated systems, such as molecular nitrogen and oxygen, across various ASs. Noiseless simulations using the new ansatz yield ground-state energies comparable to those from the UCCSD ansatz while reducing circuit depth by 50-70%. Moreover, in noisy simulations, our approach achieves energy error rates an order of magnitude lower than that of UCCSD. Considering the efficiency and practical usage of our ansatz, we hope that it becomes a potential choice for performing quantum chemistry calculations on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Sympathetic rotational cooling of large trapped molecular ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a protocol for the sympathetic cooling of a molecular asymmetric top rotor co-trapped with laser-cooled atomic ions, based on resonant coupling between the molecular ion's electric dipole moment and a common normal mode of the trapped particles. By combining sympathetic sideband laser cooling with coherent microwave excitation, we demonstrate the efficient depopulation of arbitrary rotational subspaces and the ability to cool an incoherent distribution of rotational states into a single, well-defined quantum state. This capability opens the door to exploiting the rotational Hilbert space for applications in quantum information processing and high-precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the development of a new instrument for cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy of the fundamental rovibrational transitions of molecules in the long-wave mid-infrared (LWIR) region from 6500 to 10000 nm. Our setup combines a LWIR frequency comb, a high-finesse optical enhancement cavity, a cryogenic buffer gas cooling cell, and a Fourier transform interferometer to obtain broadband, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity molecular absorption spectra. Here, we showcase the capabilities of this setup by presenting the gas-phase LWIR spectra of the $\nu_6$ band of ethane and the $\nu_{10}$ band of the gauche conformer of ethanol near 7200 nm under both room temperature and cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the first-reaction time and the acquired boundary local time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical correlation between the first-reaction time of a diffusing particle and its boundary local time accumulated until the reaction event. Since the reaction event occurs after multiple encounters of the particle with a partially reactive boundary, the boundary local time as a proxy for the number of such encounters is not independent of, but intrinsically linked to, the first-reaction time. We propose a universal theoretical framework to derive their joint probability density and, in particular, the correlation coefficient. To illustrate the dependence of these correlations on the boundary reactivity and shape, we obtain explicit analytical solutions for several basic domains. The analytical results are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, which we employ to examine the role of interior obstacles on correlations in disordered media. Applications of these statistical results in chemical physics are discussed</description>
