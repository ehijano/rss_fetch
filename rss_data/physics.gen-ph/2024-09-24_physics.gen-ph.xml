      <title>Tsallis-Cirto entropy of black hole and black hole atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta$-entropy with $\delta=2$ to the black hole suggests that the mass spectrum of the black hole is equidistant, $M=NM_0$. Here $N$ is an integer number and $M_0=\sqrt{2}m_{\rm P}$ is the mass quantum expressed via the reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}$. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole with mass $M=NM_0$ is $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N^2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum determinism and completeness restored by indistinguishability and long-time particle detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that measurement data in quantum physics can be rigorously interpreted only as a result of a statistical, macroscopic process, taking into account the indistinguishable character of identical particles. Quantum determinism is in principle possible on the condition that a fully-fledged quantum model is used to describe the measurement device in interaction with the studied object as one system. In contrast, any approach that relies on Born's rule discriminates the dynamics of a quantum system from that of the detector with which it interacts during measurement. In this work, we critically analyze the validity of this measurement postulate applied to single-event signals. In fact, the concept of ``individual'' particle becomes inadequate once both indistinguishability and a scattering approach allowing an unlimited interaction time for an effective detection, are considered as they should be, hence preventing the separability of two successive measurement events. In this context, measurement data should therefore be understood only as a result of statistics over many events. Accounting for the intrinsic noise of the sources and the detectors, we also show with the illustrative cases of the Schr\"odinger cat and the Bell experiment that once the Born rule is abandoned on the level of a single particle, realism, locality and causality are restored. We conclude that indiscernibility and long-time detection process make quantum physics not fundamentally probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Testing stimulated emission photon direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While naively laser only allow to excite external target, for example STED microscopy demonstrates it can also cause its deexitation, however, under uncommon condition of being prepared as excited. These two causations are governed by stimulated emission-absorption pair of equations, and there are presented many arguments that they are switched in perspective of CPT symmetry, however, it would mean photon direction opposite to usually assumed. This article discusses these arguments and proposes simple STED-like tests to experimentally determine this direction once for all, to be performed in a near future. Depending on its result: it should lead to new applications like 2WQC more symmetric quantum computers, or macroscopic violation of CPT symmetry, so far tested only in microscopic settings. Also forward/backward/bidirectional photon sources are discussed.</description>

      <title>A conjecture to prove Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view of the relations between Riemann hypothesis and quantum theory according to the Hilbert-Polya conjecture and further related investigations its proof is important also for the quantum physics. I conjecture to prove Riemann hypothesis according to Riemann's saddle point method which is used by Riemann to derive the integral representation of zeta function.</description>
