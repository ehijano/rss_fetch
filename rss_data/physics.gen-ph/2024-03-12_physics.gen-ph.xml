      <title>The new concepts of ether and calculation of the cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the general theory of relativity (GR) meets some difficulties, it seems that new considerations on the ether theories of gravitation in the history are needed. A theory of gravity based on some new concepts of ether and particles is briefly reviewed. In this theory, the universe is filled with a kind of fluid which may be called the $\Omega(0)$ substratum, or we say the gravitational ether. Particles are modeled as sink flows in the $\Omega(0)$ substratum. Newton's law of gravitation is derived by methods of fluid mechanics. Thus, gravity is interpreted as attractive force between sinks in the $\Omega(0)$ substratum. The theoretical calculation of the cosmological constant (CC) based on a mechanical model of vacuum is briefly reviewed. A proposed solution of the cosmological constant problem (CCP) is discussed. Inspired by the association of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) event GRB 170817A, we propose a theoretical calculation of the mass density of the electromagnetic ether.</description>

      <title>Unitary quantum gravitational physics and the CMB parity asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposal of Direct-Sum Quantum Field Theory (DQFT) offers a new perspective for quantum fields by combining parity and time reversal operations, blurring the distinction between quantum past and future while preserving causality. This approach provides a unitary QFT in curved spacetime, resolving the information-loss paradox. When applied to inflationary quantum fluctuations, DQFT predicts variations in CMB measurements, explaining longstanding anomalies as a result of parity asymmetry. The data strongly supports the unitary treatment of quantum fluctuations, with a probability over 650 times greater than the standard prediction. This significant discrepancy underscores the validity and importance of the DQFT approach in understanding the intricate relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics.</description>
