      <title>Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport is essential for cellular function, presenting a canonical example of rapid molecular sorting inside cells. It consists of a coordinated interplay between import/export of molecules in/out the cell nucleus. Here, we investigate the role of spatio-temporal dynamics of the nucleocytoplasmic transport and its regulation. We develop a biophysical model that captures the main features of the nucleocytoplasmic transport, in particular, its regulation through the Ran cycle. Our model yields steady-state profiles for the molecular components of the Ran cycle, their relaxation times, as well as the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic molecule ratio. We show that these quantities are affected by their spatial dynamics and heterogeneity within the nucleus. Specifically, we find that the spatial nonuniformity of Ran Guanine Exchange Factor (RanGEF) -- particularly its proximity to the nuclear envelope -- enhances the Ran cycle's efficiency. We further show that RanGEF's accumulation near the nuclear envelope results from its intrinsic dynamics as a nuclear cargo, transported by the Ran cycle itself. Overall, our work highlights the critical role of molecular spatial dynamics in cellular processes, and proposes new avenues for theoretical and experimental inquiries into the nucleocytoplasmic transport.</description>

      <title>Emergence of large-scale mechanical spiral waves in bacterial living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagating spiral waves have been discovered in various chemical, biological and physical systems. Spiral waves in multicellular organisms are often associated with essential living functions. Although certain eukaryotic microorganisms have long been known to generate spiral waves, evidence of spiral wave pattern has not been lacking in the bacterial world. Here we report the discovery of a unique form of propagating spiral waves in dense bacterial populations where cells engage in cyclic force-generating processes driven by type-IV pilus motility. Specifically, we discovered that synchronization of pilus activity in the bacterial living matter leads to large-scale spatiotemporal regulation of tension force in the form of propagating spiral waves. Theoretical modelling reveals that the spiral tension waves result from nonreciprocity in cell-cell interactions. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of large-scale force regulation in bacterial world and may shed light on the emergent mechanics of biofilms and microbiomes. Pilus-driven bacterial living matter also provides a mechanical active medium for studying electrical or chemical spiral waves in living systems.</description>

      <title>Uncovering quantum characteristics of incipient evolutions at the photosynthetic oxygen evolving complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water oxidation of photosynthesis at the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) is driven by the polarization field induced by the photoelectric hole. By highlighting the role of the polarization field in reshaping the spin-orbit coupling deduced from the Dirac quantum mechanics, we reveal in this work the characteristics and underlying mechanism in the relatively simpler OEC evolutions within the states S0 - S2 prior to the water oxidation. The characteristic shifts of the density of states (DOS) of the electron donor Mn atom are observed in the vicinity of the Fermi surface to occur with the spin flips of Mn atoms and the change of the Mn oxidation states during the electron transfer. Notably, the spin flips of Mn atoms point to the resulting spin configuration of the next states. It is found that the electron transfer tend to stabilize the catalyst OEC itself, whereas the proton transfer pushes the evolution forward by preparing a new electron donor. Meanwhile, it shows that the Mn-O bonds around the candidate Mn atom of the electron donor undergo characteristic changes in the bond lengths during the electron transfer. These concomitant phenomena uncovered in first-principle calculations characterize the essential equilibrium of the OEC between the state evolution and stability that forms a ground of the dynamic OEC cycles.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on protein kinases and their inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>

      <title>Microbial iron reduction under oxic conditions: implications for subsurface biogeochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron (Fe) reduction is one of Earth's most ancient microbial metabolisms, but after atmosphere-ocean oxygenation, this anaerobic process was relegated to niche anoxic environments below the water and soil surface. However, new technologies to monitor redox processes at the microscale relevant to microbial cells have recently revealed that the oxygen (O2) concentrations controlling the distribution of aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms are more heterogeneous than previously believed. To explore how O2 levels regulate microbial Fe reduction, we cultivated a facultative Fe-reducing bacterium using a cutting-edge microfluidic reactor integrated with transparent planar O2 sensors. Contrary to expectations, microbial growth induced Fe(III)-oxide (ferrihydrite) reduction under fully oxygenated conditions without forming O2-depleted microsites. Batch incubations highlighted the importance of the process at a larger scale, fundamentally changing our understanding of Fe cycling from the conceptualization of metal and nutrient mobility in the subsurface to our interpretation of Fe mineralogy in the rock record.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quasiconformal morphodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal imaging of biological epithelial structures yields shape data at discrete time points, leading to a natural question: how can we reconstruct the most likely path of growth patterns consistent with these discrete observations? We present a physically plausible framework to solve this inverse problem by creating a framework that generalizes quasiconformal maps to quasiconformal flows. By allowing for the spatio-temporal variation of the shear and dilatation fields during the growth process, subject to regulatory mechanisms, we are led to a type of generalized Ricci flow. When guided by observational data associated with surface shape as a function of time, this leads to a constrained optimization problem. Deploying our data-driven algorithmic approach to the shape of insect wings, leaves and even sculpted faces, we show how optimal quasiconformal flows allow us to characterize the morphogenesis of a range of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Rapid, antibiotic incubation-free determination of tuberculosis drug resistance using machine learning and Raman spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's deadliest infectious disease, with over 1.5 million deaths annually and 10 million new cases reported each year. The causative organism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can take nearly 40 days to culture, a required step to determine the pathogen's antibiotic susceptibility. Both rapid identification of Mtb and rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) are essential for effective patient treatment and combating antimicrobial resistance. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, culture-free, and antibiotic incubation-free drug susceptibility test for TB using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning. We collect few-to-single-cell Raman spectra from over 25,000 cells of the MtB complex strain Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) resistant to one of the four mainstay anti-TB drugs, isoniazid, rifampicin, moxifloxacin and amikacin, as well as a pan susceptible wildtype strain. By training a neural network on this data, we classify the antibiotic resistance profile of each strain, both on dried samples and in patient sputum samples. On dried samples, we achieve &gt;98% resistant versus susceptible classification accuracy across all 5 BCG strains. In patient sputum samples, we achieve ~79% average classification accuracy. We develop a feature recognition algorithm in order to verify that our machine learning model is using biologically relevant spectral features to assess the resistance profiles of our mycobacterial strains. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be deployed in resource-limited settings by developing a low-cost, portable Raman microscope that costs &lt;$5000. We show how this instrument and our machine learning model enables combined microscopy and spectroscopy for accurate few-to-single-cell drug susceptibility testing of BCG.</description>

      <title>Field theory for mechanical criticality in disordered fiber networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strain-controlled criticality governs the elasticity of jamming and fiber networks. While the upper critical dimension of jamming is believed to be $d_u$=2, non mean-field exponents are observed in numerical studies of 2D and 3D fiber networks. The origins of this remains unclear. In this study we propose a minimal mean-field model for strain-controlled criticality of fiber networks. We then extend this to a phenomenological field theory, in which non mean-field behavior emerges as a result of the disorder in the network structure. We predict that the upper critical dimension for such systems is $d_u$=4 using a Gaussian approximation. Moreover, we identify an order parameter for the phase transition, which has been lacking for fiber networks to date.</description>

      <title>Is the Emergence of Life an Expected Phase Transition in the Evolving Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel definition of life in terms of which its emergence in the universe is expected, and its ever-creative open-ended evolution is entailed by no law. Living organisms are Kantian Wholes that achieve Catalytic Closure, Constraint Closure, and Spatial Closure. We here unite for the first time two established mathematical theories, namely Collectively Autocatalytic Sets and the Theory of the Adjacent Possible. The former establishes that a first-order phase transition to molecular reproduction is expected in the chemical evolution of the universe where the diversity and complexity of molecules increases; the latter posits that, under loose hypotheses, if the system starts with a small number of beginning molecules, each of which can combine with copies of itself or other molecules to make new molecules, over time the number of kinds of molecules increases slowly but then explodes upward hyperbolically. Together these theories imply that life is expected as a phase transition in the evolving universe. The familiar distinction between software and hardware loses its meaning in living cells. We propose new ways to study the phylogeny of metabolisms, new astronomical ways to search for life on exoplanets, new experiments to seek the emergence of the most rudimentary life, and the hint of a coherent testable pathway to prokaryotes with template replication and coding.</description>

      <title>Mechanics and wrinkling patterns of pressurized bent tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Take a drinking straw and bend it from its ends. After sufficient bending, the tube buckles forming a kink, where the curvature is localized in a very small area. This instability, known generally as the Brazier effect, is inherent to thin-walled cylindrical shells, which are particularly ubiquitous in living systems, such as rod-shaped bacteria. However, tubular biological structures are often pressurized, and the knowledge of the mechanical response upon bending in this scenario is limited. In this work, we use a computational model to study the mechanical response and the deformations as a result of bending pressurized tubes. In addition, we employ tension-field theory to describe the mechanical behaviour before and after the wrinkling transition. Furthermore, we investigate the development and evolution of wrinkle patterns beyond the instability, showing different wrinkled configurations. We discover the existence of a multi-wavelength mode following the purely sinusoidal wrinkles and anticipating the kinked configuration of the tube.</description>
