      <title>Rectifiability of the singular strata for harmonic maps to Euclidean buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a natural notion of the singular strata for harmonic maps into $F$-connected complexes (which include locally finite Euclidean buildings), and prove the rectifiability of these strata. We additionally establish bounds on the Minkowski content for certain quantitative strata, following the rectifiable Reifenberg program of [NV17]. This builds on a result of the second author [D], which showed that the full singular set is $(n-2)$-rectifiable.</description>

      <title>Interior control for surfaces with positive scalar curvature and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M^n$, $n\in\{3,4,5\}$, be a closed aspherical $n$-manifold and $S\subset M$ a subset consisting of disjoint incompressible embedded closed aspherical submanifolds (possibly with different dimensions). When $n =3,4$, we show that $M\setminus S$ cannot admit any complete metric with positive scalar curvature. When $n=5$, we obtain the same result either when $S$ contains a submanifold of codimension 1 or 2, or when $S$ itself is a connected submaifold of codimension $\ge 3.$ The key ingredient is a new interior control for the extrinsic diameter of surfaces with positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>On Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes and Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent papers on spacetimes with a signature-changing metric, the concept of a Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole and new elements for Lorentzian-Riemannian signature change have been introduced. A Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole is a signature-changing modification of the Schwarzschild spacetime satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations in a weak sense. Here the event horizon serves as a boundary beyond which time becomes imaginary. We demonstrate that the proper time needed to reach the horizon remains finite, consistently with the classical Schwarzschild solution. About Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions, we stress that the hypersurface where the metric signature changes is naturally a spacelike hypersurface which might be identified with the future or past causal boundary of the Lorentzian sector. Moreover, a number of geometric interpretations appear, as the degeneracy of the metric corresponds to the collapse of the causal cones into a line, the degeneracy of the dual metric corresponds to collapsing into a hyperplane, and additional geometric structures on the transition hypersurface (Galilean and dual Galilean) might be explored.</description>

      <title>Compactness of the $Q$-curvature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete resolution to the question of the $C^4$-compactness for the solution set of the constant $Q$-curvature problem on a smooth closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $5 \leq n \leq 24$. For dimensions $n\geq 25$, an example of an $L^{\infty}$-unbounded sequence of solutions for $n \geq 25$ has been known for over a decade (Wei-Zhao). On the other hand, Li-Xiong established compactness in dimensions $5\leq n \leq 9$ (under some conditions). Our principal observation is that the linearized equation associated with the $Q$-curvature problem can be transformed into an overdetermined linear system, which admits a nontrivial solution due to an unexpected algebraic structure of the Paneitz operator. This key insight plays a crucial role in extending the compactness result to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Regularization via Curved Momentum Space: A Geometric Solution to Divergences in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of UV divergences in QFT has long been a fundamental challenge. Standard regularization techniques modify high-energy behavior to ensure well-defined integrals. However, these approaches often introduce unphysical parameters, rely on arbitrary prescriptions, or break fundamental symmetries, making them mathematically effective but conceptually unsatisfactory.
  We propose a novel and self-consistent approach in which UV regularization emerges naturally from the curved geometry of momentum space. Through curved momentum space, imposed by a geodesic metric, we construct an integral measure that inherently suppresses high-energy divergences while preserving fundamental symmetries, including full Lorentz invariance. This framework is self-sufficient, i.e. requires no external regulators. It retains equations of motion and is fully compatibility with standard field theory
  Our approach guarantees the weakest possible suppression necessary for convergence, avoiding excessive modifications to quantum behavior, still achieving convergence. While formulated in Riemannian Geometry, we show seamless extension to Minkowski space, maintainining regularization properties in relativistic QFT. This offers an alternative to ad hoc renormalization, providing an intrinsic and mathematically well-motivated suppression mechanism, purely rooted in curved geometry of momentum space.
  We rigorously construct the measure-theoretic framework and demonstrate its effectiveness by proof of finiteness for key QFT integrals. Beyond resolving divergences, this work suggests broader applications in spectral geometry, effective field theory, and potential extensions to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>On locally conformally flat manifolds with positive pinched Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Yamabe flow, we prove that if $(M^n,g)$, $n\geq3$, is an $n$-dimensional locally conformally flat complete Riemannian manifold $Rc\geq \epsilon Rg&gt;0$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is a uniformly constant, then $M^n$ must be compact. Our result shows that Hamilton's pinching conjecture also holds for higher dimensional case if we assume additionally the metric is locally conformally flat.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of conformal heat flow of harmonic maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03444v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal heat flow of harmonic maps is a system of evolution equations combined with harmonic map flow with metric evolution in conformal direction. It is known that global weak solution of the flow exists and smooth except at mostly finitely many singular points. In this paper, we show that no finite time singularity occurs, unlike the usual harmonic map flow. And if the initial energy is small, we can obtain the uniform convergence of the map to a point and the conformal factor of the metric under some time sequence $t_n \to \infty$. Also, under the assumption that energy concentration is uniform in time, we show that there exists a sequence of time $t_n \to \infty$ such that $f(\cdot,t_n)$ converges to a harmonic map in $W^{1,2}$ on any compact set away from at most finitely many points.</description>

      <title>Positive Biorthogonal Curvature on $S^2 \times T^2$: An open problem no more?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the long-standing open problem regarding the existence of a Riemannian metric on $ S^2 \times T^2 $ with strictly positive biorthogonal curvature: "Does $S^2 \times T^2$ admit a Riemannian metric with positive biorthogonal curvature?". Biorthogonal curvature, defined as the average of the sectional curvatures of a plane and its orthogonal complement, represents an intermediate condition between positive sectional curvature and positive scalar curvature. By rigorously analyzing topological and geometric constraints, we show the existence of such a metric.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Cosymplectic groupoids by cosymplectic moment maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction has an analogous version for cosymplectic manifolds. In this paper we extend this cosymplectic reduction to the context of groupoids. Moreover, we prove how in the case of an algebroid associated to a cosymplectic groupoid, the integration commutes with the reduction (analogously to what happens in Poisson geometry). On the other hand, we show how the cosymplectic reduction of a groupoid induces a symplectic reduction on a canonical symplectic subgroupoid. Finally, we study what happens to the multiplicative Chern class associated with the $S^1$-central extensions of the reduced groupoid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consequence of two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, being close throughout a subset of their domain. A particular consequence of our results is the following. Given $K_0 &gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\gamma &gt; \eta &gt; 0$ there is a constant $\delta = \delta(\gamma,\eta,\varepsilon,K_0) &gt; 0$ for which the following is true. Let $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and $f , h : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lip$(\gamma)$ functions whose Lip$(\gamma)$ norms are both bounded above by $K_0$. Suppose $B \subset \Sigma$ is closed and that $f$ and $h$ coincide throughout $B$. Then over the set of points in $\Sigma$ whose distance to $B$ is at most $\delta$ we have that the Lip$(\eta)$ norm of the difference $f-h$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon$. More generally, we establish that this phenomenon remains valid in a less restrictive Banach space setting under the weaker hypothesis that the two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions $f$ and $h$ are only close in a pointwise sense throughout the closed subset $B$. We require only that the subset $\Sigma$ be closed; in particular, the case that $\Sigma$ is finite is covered by our results. The restriction that $\eta &lt; \gamma$ is sharp in the sense that our result is false for $\eta := \gamma$.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics are systems of equations describing the evolution of macroscopic states in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. From generalized Onsager reciprocal relationships, one can formulate a class of hydrodynamics as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, Onsager gradient flows have been widely investigated in optimal transport-type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, namely hydrodynamical density manifolds. This paper studies geometric calculations in these hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate Levi-Civita connections, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport and then derive Riemannian and sectional curvatures on density manifolds. We last present closed formulas for sectional curvatures of density manifolds in one dimensional spaces, in which the sign of curvatures is characterized by the convexities of mobilities. For example, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures in zero-range models, such as independent particles, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti models.</description>

      <title>Courant Algebroid Relations, T-Dualities and Generalised Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of Courant algebroid relation is used to introduce a definition of relation between divergence operators on Courant algebroids. By introducing invariant divergence operators, a notion of generalised T-duality between divergences is presented through an existence and uniqueness result for related divergence operators on T-dual pairs of exact Courant algebroids, which naturally incorporates the dilaton shift. When combined with the notion of generalised isometry, this establishes circumstances under which generalised Ricci tensors are related, proving that T-duality is compatible with generalised string background equations. This enables an analysis of the compatibility between T-duality and generalised Ricci flow, showing that the T-dual of a solution of generalised Ricci flow is also a solution of generalised Ricci flow. Our constructions are illustrated through many explicit examples.</description>
