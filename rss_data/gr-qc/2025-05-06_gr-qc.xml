      <title>Evolution of a black hole cluster in full general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evolve for the first time in full general relativity a small, collisional N-body black hole cluster of arbitrary total mass M. The bound cluster is initially compact (radius R/M~10), stable, and consists of 25 equal-mass, nonspinning black holes. The dynamical interactions of compact objects in N-body clusters is of great interest for the formation of black holes in the upper mass gap as well as intermediate and supermassive black holes. These are potential sources of gravitational waves that may be detected by both current and future observatories. Unlike previous N-body Newtonian and post-Newtonian simulations, no "subgrid physics" is required to handle collisions and mergers. We can therefore confirm in full general relativity several predictions from these simulations and analytic estimates: the runaway growth of a large black hole via repeated mergers; spindown of the central black hole with increasing captures; the ejection of a black hole with a large asymptotic velocity due to a several-body interaction; and a regime where mergers occur primarily via direct collisions on highly eccentric orbits instead of quasicircular inspirals. We extract the gravitational wave signal and find it has several distinct features associated with the compact cluster regime. Our results suggest the signal is sufficiently loud that next generation observatories would likely be able to detect similar events across most of the observable universe. This work is a preliminary proof-of-principle study that we hope will open up a new arena for numerical relativity and the study of N-body compact systems.</description>

      <title>The hidden truth of ideal relativistic fluids: the matter Lagrangian is its total energy density, not its pressure!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been established in the literature that the matter Lagrangian of an ideal fluid can be expressed either as its total energy density or as its pressure. In this work, we demonstrate that identifying the matter Lagrangian with the pressure leads to physical inconsistencies, which are resolved when the fluid is coupled to the gravitational field. In such a scenario, the matter Lagrangian necessarily assumes the value of the total energy density. We thus conclude that, for an ideal fluid, the only physically consistent choice for the matter Lagrangian is its total energy density.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Solutions in Dark Photon Models with Higher Order Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive new analytic, static, symmetric black hole solutions in theories involving dark photons with minimal and higher-order magnetic dipole interactions. Starting from the effective non-relativistic potential between fermions mediated by a dark photon, we derive explicit corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry induced by dark photon and spin-dependent terms. These corrections alter the metric significantly at short distances, modifying the horizon radius, Hawking temperature, photon sphere, and consequently, the black hole shadow. Employing perturbative expansions, we provide analytic expressions for the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution, highlighting an exponential suppression controlled by the dark photon mass. Our results demonstrate that higher-order magnetic dipole interactions produce distinctive spin-dependent curvature terms, amplifying gravitational effects near the horizon. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for future phenomenological tests of dark photon models through gravitational wave astronomy and black hole imaging, while highlighting dark photons' role as mediators of dark matter interactions that can influence structure formation and direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Isentropic process of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes: a possible excess of the entropy bound via a non-perturbative channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications of an isentropic processes applied to a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This process is possible if a black hole absorbs a particle with a specific ratio of energy and charge. We show that such an absorption process is not classically allowed, not only in Einstein gravity but also in several modified gravity theories, indicating that this prohibition is quite generic. However, an isentropic absorption process is quantum mechanically allowed: the particle can penetrate the potential barrier on the event horizon. We compute the probability of this absorption process and compare it to that of semi-classical effects. Non-perturbatively, if this process is accumulated, it is possible that the entanglement entropy can be greater than its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and violate the entropy-bound relation.</description>

      <title>On weak solutions in Einstein theory and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spherical symmetry, gravitational collapse of dust may give rise to the so-called shell-crossing singularities, beyond which spacetime can be extended using weak solutions to the integrated version of the equations of motion. We argue that the paradigm of weak solutions is ill-suited for dynamical extension beyond shell crossings through shock waves because it is based implicitly on an assumption that turns out to be unphysical for the shock and leads to the unwanted prospect of shock waves of dust particles moving faster than light.</description>

      <title>Deflection Angle in the Strong Deflection Limit and Quasinormal Modes in Stationary Axisymmetric Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a coordinate-invariant expression for the photon deflection angle in the strong deflection limit (SDL) of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. The key logarithmic-divergence coefficient is shown to depend only on quantities locally measurable by a zero-angular-momentum observer -- curvature scalars, the circumferential radius, and the proper angular velocity. The same coefficient governs the damping rate of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal limit, establishing a curvature-based, model-independent connection between QNMs and lensing in the SDL near rotating compact objects.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Effects in Gravitational Wave Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate gravitational waves beyond the linear approximation, focusing on second-order contributions sourced by linearized waves in the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge. A general spacetime metric is constructed, and both timelike and null geodesic congruences are analyzed. For the timelike congruence, a non-vanishing expansion scalar and shear tensor are obtained, while the rotation tensor is found to vanish. In contrast, all these quantities vanish for the null congruence. Using a parallel-transported orthonormal tetrad, we derive the geodesic deviation equations up to second order in the wave amplitude $H$, showing that, as in the linear case, stretching and compression occur in the transverse $x$ and $y$ directions. However, when solving the geodesic equations numerically within the 3+1 formalism, we observe an additional effect: test particles undergo a small, second-order displacement along the direction of wave propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the cosmological constant where the source of the gravitational field consists of a magnetic field and dust. In particular, we restrict our study to the case of Bianchi type III models. All these solutions either start with a singularity and then expand, or they are initially collapsing and end at a singularity. We discuss the physical meaning of the parameters appearing in the metrics and examine the possible subcases and the relative importance of the dust and the magnetic field as we approach the singularity.</description>

      <title>Phonons mimicking doubly special relativity kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective excitations (phonons) in barotropic, irrotational, inviscid fluids exhibit an effective Lorentz invariance, where the sound speed plays the role of the invariant speed of light in special relativity. By carefully selecting the interaction potentials, we explicitly construct two hydrodynamic models in which phonons obey doubly special relativistic kinematics, with the analogue Planck scale emerging from non-Newtonian behaviour at high energies. Specifically, we demonstrate that elastic storage leads to an approximate realization of Amelino-Camelia's scenario, while the Magueijo-Smolin model naturally emerges in the presence of elastic restoring forces.</description>

      <title>Upper bound on the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a universal upper bound on the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCOs) for massive particles in static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes. By analyzing the spacetime metrics with external matter fields, we derive the characteristic equation for ISCO via the effective potential method. By imposing appropriate energy conditions for the matter fields, we rigorously demonstrate that the ISCO radius is bounded by $r_{\mathrm{ISCO}}\le 6M$, where $M$ is the total ADM mass of the black hole. The Schwarzschild black hole saturates this bound ($r_{\mathrm{ISCO}}=6M$), and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, supergravity black holes, fluid sphere models, which satisfy the imposed energy conditions, also obey $r_{\mathrm{ISCO}}\le 6M$. The universality of this upper limit provides a theoretical benchmark for observational astrophysics: deviations from $6M$ in accretion disk observations or gravitational wave signals could indicate the presence of exotic matter fields. This work highlights the interplay between black hole geometry and external matter fields, paving the way for future studies in compact object dynamics.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Nucleation via Topological Surgery in Lorentzian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a $0$-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed $4$-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^2$ -- to obtain an everywhere non-degenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity -- unavoidable in topology-changing spacetimes -- with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is, therefore, non-singular but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction thus shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>Effects of bumblebee gravity on neutrino motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how the spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry -- modeled through a black hole solution in the context of bumblebee gravity -- affects the propagation and dynamics of neutrinos. The investigation centers on three distinct aspects: the rate of energy deposition due to neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation, modifications to the neutrino oscillation phase driven by the underlying spacetime structure, and the influence of gravitational lensing on flavor conversion probabilities. To support the theoretical considerations, numerical simulations are conducted for oscillation probabilities in a two-flavor framework, taking into account both normal and inverted mass orderings. For comparison, the outcomes are juxtaposed with those obtained in a different Lorentz-violating background, namely, a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity.</description>

      <title>On Charged Black Holes in Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist two branches of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in Einstein-Weyl theory: one is the Schwarzschild black hole, and the other is a numerically constructed black hole that bifurcates from the Schwarzschild solution. Similarly, there are two branches of charged black holes in Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell theory. We have uncovered the relationships between the charged black holes and the neutral ones. The two charged black holes branch out from the bifurcation point of the neutral ones once charge is added. We found that one of the charged black holes is entirely different from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, while the other is similar to the RN black hole. In particular, the RN-like black hole approaches the RN black hole as the charge increases. We calculated the charge-to-mass ratio of the RN-like charged black hole in the near-extremal limit, and the value is less than that of the extremal RN black hole. Since we consider the higher-derivative Weyl square term as part of the classical gravity theory, rather than as a quantum effect, our result sets a lower bound on the charge-to-mass ratio in the context of the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Smarr formula for black holes with primary and secondary scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the thermodynamics of black holes endowed with primary and secondary scalar hair in the shift and ${\rm Z}_2$ symmetric subclass of beyond Horndeski gravity. Under a specific fine-tuning of the scalar parameter $q$ in terms of the black hole mass, the singular black-hole solution with primary scalar hair reduces to the regular Bardeen solution featuring secondary scalar hair. We first demonstrate that the traditional thermodynamic approach fails to yield a consistent Smarr formula for both solutions under consideration. To address this issue, we adopt the approach introduced in [Phys$.$Rev$.$Lett. 132 (2024) 19, 191401], and we derive both the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Smarr formula, offering a consistent thermodynamic description for scalar-hairy black holes. As an additional outcome, our analysis reveals a connection between the solutions with primary and secondary scalar hair.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions, Shadows, and Microstructure of Kerr-anti-de Sitter Black Holes from Geometrothermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we investigate the phase-transition structure and microstructure of the Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole and show the relationship with its shadow structure. By treating the curvature radius as a thermodynamic variable, we ensure scaling consistency and model the system as quasi-homogeneous. In the canonical ensemble, we identify critical points and characterize both first- and second-order phase transitions independently of pressure. In the grand-canonical ensemble, we reveal a distinct phase structure, including the Hawking-Page transition. We derive analytical expressions for the Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole shadow and its critical parameters, using shadow thermodynamics to construct asymmetric shadow profiles that capture the phase-transition structure. Finally, we show that the singularities of the geometrothermodynamic curvature in the shadow align with divergences in thermodynamic response functions, confirming the correspondence between shadows, phase transitions, and microstructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will summarize recent results on the Hamiltonian equivalence between the Jordan and Einstein frames based on the analysis of Brans-Dicke theory for both cases \omega\neq -\frac{3}{2} and \omega =-\frac{3}{2}. We will introduce and perform ADM analysis for spherically symmetric solutions of gravity. We will discuss with particular care the problem of the boundary terms to be introduced in the general case of spherical symmetry. These two frames are connected through a Hamiltonian canonical transformation on the reduced phase space obtained by gauge fixing the lapse and the radial shift functions. We introduce and discuss two static solutions (Fisher, Janis, Newman and Winicour solution in the Einstein frame and Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole solution in the Jordan frame)</description>

Abstract: In the paper [I], the first part of our work, we established the model of interaction of five elements: first, a unit time-like vector field, associated with the velocity of dynamic aether, second, the pseudoscalar field describing an axionic component of the dark matter, third, the electromagnetic field, fourth, the relativistic multi-component plasma and, fifth, the gravitational field. The initial step of analysis of this model was the reconstruction of the equilibrium states of the axionically-aetherically active plasma, which are characterized by frequent inter-particle collisions. In the second part of the work, presented here, in the framework of isotropic homogeneous cosmological model we consider the collisionless limit of the theory, and thus, we focus on the analysis of the particle dynamics under the influence of axionically-aetherically induced forces. The complete distribution functions, as exact solutions to the kinetic equations, are presented. Based on five examples of the background solutions of the model, we discuss the symptoms of plasma instability provoked by the influence of forces of the friction and tidal types.</description>

      <title>DeepHMC : a deep-neural-network acclerated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for binary neutron star parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep neural network (DNN) accelerated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm called DeepHMC for the inference of binary neutron star systems. The HMC is a non-random walk sampler that uses background gradient information to accelerate the convergence of the sampler. While faster converging than a random-walk sampler, in theory by a factor of the dimensionality of the problem, a known computational bottleneck for HMC algorithms is the calculation of gradients of the log-likelihood. We demonstrate that Hamiltonian trajectories based on a DNN gradients are 30 times faster than those based on the relative binning gradients, and 7000 times faster than trajectories based on a naive likelihood gradient calculation. Using the publicly available 128 second LVK data set for the binary neutron star mergers GW170817 and GW190425, we show that not only does DeepHMC produce produces highly accurate and consistent results with the LVK public data, but acquires 5000 statistically independent samples (SIS) in the $12D$ parameter space in approximately two hours on a Macbook pro for GW170817, with a cost of $&lt;1$ second/SIS, and 2.5 days for GW190425, with a cost of $\sim25$ seconds/SIS.</description>

      <title>Extended Einstein-Dirac-aether theory: Spinor modifications of the dynamic aether kinetic term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the Einstein-Dirac-aether theory the extended model is established, in which the backreaction of the spinor field on the unit vector field, describing the dynamic aether, is taken into account. For this purpose, we extended the Jacobson constitutive tensor, which enters the kinetic part of the Lagrangian of the unit vector (aetheric) field, by the terms containing spinor tensors and pseudotensors. The self-consistent system of master equations for the unit vector field, as well as, the spinor and gravitational fields is derived using the variation formalism in the framework of the effective field theory up to the second order in derivatives.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology Without Singularities: A New Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article is dedicated to a discussion regarding the role of Barrow's ''Zero Universes'' in quantum cosmology. In particular, we demonstrate that if quantum gravity effects are modeled by the quantum potential method associated with the ''many interacting universes'' (MIU) model, then the mere presence of the universes with a zero scale factor (the ``Zero universes'') produces a veritably remarkable outcome: the classical cosmological singularities of Big Bang, Big Crunch and Big Rip all fail to arise. In other words, those universes that are considered ill-posed at the classical level may turn out to be a necessary and sought-after ingredient in a future internally consistent quantum theory of gravity. Finally, we argue that the MIU quantization method might shed light on a number of other cosmological mysteries; for example, it might account for a decoherence which preceded the eternal inflation, and elucidate how the quantum superposition of vacuum decays occurring at different places might give birth to actual bubble universes there. In addition, the new method might help explain why our universe was born in an extremely low-entropy initial state required to trigger the initial inflation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of innermost stable circular orbit and light ring of a charged black hole induced by the scalarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamical evolution of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light ring of a charged black hole during dynamical scalarization. This is achieved through nonlinear simulations within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. Using the time-dependent metric derived from these simulations, we compute the radial effective potentials for timelike and null geodesics as functions of time. Our results demonstrate how the ISCO and light ring evolve as a hairless charged black hole transitions to a scalarized state. We find that dynamical scalarization induces an increase in the areal radii of both the ISCO and light ring. These findings provide new insights into black hole scalarization, particularly regarding the temporal evolution of the ISCO and light ring in a dynamically evolving spacetime.</description>

      <title>Timelike periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms around quantum-corrected black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the periodic orbits of timelike particles around two types of static spherically symmetric quantum-corrected black hole models that satisfy covariance, exploring the impact of quantum corrections on both the particle orbits and the associated gravitational wave signals. First, we derive the particle trajectories from the timelike geodesic equations. We then discuss two important types of bound orbits: the marginally bound orbit and the innermost stable circular orbit. For the first model, increasing the quantum parameter $\zeta$ leads to larger orbital radii and reduced angular momenta for both orbits. In contrast, the second model shows $\zeta$-independent orbital characteristics. By analyzing the effective potential, we determine the allowed $(E,L)$ ranges for bound orbits, with $\zeta$-dependence appearing only in the first model. We further present examples of periodic orbits at fixed particle energy for both black holes, revealing that the parameter $\zeta$ similarly affects the orbits in both cases, although its effect is negligible in the second model. Finally, we calculate the gravitational waves emitted by the periodic orbits in both models. The results demonstrate that increasing $\zeta$ leads to a significant phase delay for the first model, while only inducing a subtle phase advance for the second model. Therefore, we conclude that the first model can be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole through gravitational wave observations, whereas the second model cannot be effectively distinguished when the quantum correction is weak.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. These models are described by $f\left( R,\mathcal{G}\right) =f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $ theory of gravity. They are equivalent to models linear in the Ricci scalar $R$ and in the Gauss-Bonnet scalar $\mathcal{G}$ with one nonminimally coupled scalar field without kinetic term. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations to investigate the cosmological evolution. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe. Moreover, we discuss the initial value problem for theory to be cosmologically viable. Finally, the effects of the cold dark matter in cosmic evolution are discussed.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers help us perform parameter estimation of overlapping signals in gravitational wave detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overlapping signals represent one of the major data analysis challenges in next-generation gravitational wave detectors. We leverage Transformers and Normalizing Flows, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, to address the parameter estimation of overlapping binary black hole mergers in the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our proposed model combines a Transformer-based "Knowledge Extractor Neural Network" (KENN) with a Normalizing Flow (HYPERION) to perform rapid and unbiased inference over multiple overlapping black hole binary events. The choice of architecture leverages the strength of Transformers in capturing complex and long-range temporal structures in the strain time series data, while Normalizing Flows provide a powerful framework to sample posterior distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model over simulated gravitational wave signals, showing that it maintains the same level of accuracy regardless of the correlation level in the data. Moreover our model provides estimates of chirp mass and coalescence times within &lt;10-20% from the true simulated value. The results obtained are promising and show how this approach might represent a first step toward a deep-learning based inference pipeline for ET and other future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of fluctuations at the Planck scale, referred to as planckeons, reveals a network of quantum wormholes that realize the ER=EPR conjecture and act as holographic devices. The lattice of planckeons as wormhole mouths defines the Planck scale and generates the spacetime that emerges from the quantum entanglement of nonlocal correlations. Using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, we derive an entanglement entropy governing the thermodynamics of planckeons, with a critical temperature above the Planck scale marking a phase transition from a wormhole gas to a remnant phase. This leads to a quantum-corrected Bekenstein entropy, linking wormhole geometry with quantum information flow, and suggests a holographic origin of spacetime and black hole microstructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invoking the Klebanov-Susskind-Banks Euclidean wormhole as a bridge, we investigate the power spectrum and the entanglement between two pair-created universes. We construct a suitable global vacuum for the perturbations of the inflaton field in the Euclidean regime, which becomes a mixed state when restricted to one of the paired universes. This mixed state leads to an enhancement of the power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. In addition, entanglement between the two universes is realized by the existence of the wormhole. Thus, the power spectrum enhancement in the long-wavelength regime might be evidence of our universe being created from a Euclidean wormhole that was entangled with a partner universe, and hence our universe does not begin with a pure state.</description>

      <title>Towards an experimental implementation of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits: effect of detector gap variation on entanglement harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the prospect of experimental implementations of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits, we propose a model of variable-gap particle detector that aims to bridge some of the gaps between Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) models and realistic implementations. Using parameters tailored to potential experimental setups, we investigate entanglement harvesting in both spacelike-separated and causally connected scenarios. Our findings reveal that while variations in the energy gap reduce the ability to harvest entanglement for spacelike-separated detectors, detectors in causal contact can still become entangled through their interaction with the field. Notably, our analysis shows that (due to the derivative coupling nature of the model) even for causally connected detectors, the entanglement primarily originates from the field's correlations. This demonstrates the potential for genuine entanglement harvesting in the lab and opens the door to near-future entanglement harvesting experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: We review a string-inspired model of inflation which is a consequence of condensates of chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the primordial Universe, leading in turn to a (approximately) constant condensate of a gravitational anomaly term of Chern-Simons (CS) type, present in the Lagrangian density that describes the dynamics of the very early Universe in the model. We discuss some mechanisms for the production of chiral GW, as well as the role of periodic modulations of the potential of the gravitational axion field, that couples to the CS anomaly term, in ensuring the correct inflationary slow-roll phenomenology of this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon previous works characterizing GRW space-times using concircular and torse-forming vectors, this paper investigates a Lorentzian manifold equipped with a concircularly semi-symmetric metric connection. We demonstrate that such a manifold reduces to a GRW space-time under specific conditions: when the generator of the observed connection is a unit timelike vector. Also, in that case, the mentioned connection becomes a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection. The non-zero nature of the three curvature tensors and their corresponding Ricci tensors motivates an exploration of manifold symmetries. In this way, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the manifold to be Einstein and we prove that a perfect fluid space-time with a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection is Ricci pseudo-symmetric manifold of constant type. Furthermore, we show that if this space-time satisfies the Einstein's field equations without the cosmological constant, the strong energy condition is violated.</description>

      <title>Dirac Singleton as a Relativistic Field Beyond Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new interpretation of Dirac singletons \cite{Dirac:1963ta}, i.e. free conformal fields in $d$ dimensions, as relativistic fields in a $d+1$-dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, that differs from the Flato-Fronsdal dipole construction in $AdS_{d+1}$ \cite{Flato:1986uh}, is proposed. The $d+1$-dimensional field is described at the level of both equations and Lagrangian. It forms an infinite-dimensional representation of the $d+1$-dimensional Lorentz group that relates fields at different space-time points. The associated well-known fact is that singleton cannot be localized at a point in ${d+1}$ dimensions, hence being unobservable via local scattering/radiation phenomena in the Standard Model ($d=3$). On the other hand, that singleton respects ${d+1}$ dimensional relativistic symmetries makes it possible to introduce its interactions with gravity and other relativistic fields in $d+1$ dimensions. It is speculated that the presence of singleton in a four-dimensional field theory with non-zero cosmological constant (dark energy) can be relevant to the dark matter phenomenon and baryon asymmetry generation.</description>

      <title>The Boost Operator: Properties, Computation and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformation of radiation signals (e.g., photon occupation number and integrated intensity) between moving frames is a common task is physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Here we show that the required boost operator, relating the frequency-dependent spin-weighted spherical harmonic coefficients of the considered observable between the frames, is directly given by the aberration kernel with the Doppler weight parameter being replaced by a differential operator. The aberration kernel has been previously studied in great detail, meaning that this simplification allows us to directly compute the boost operator using the expressions of the aberration kernel. As a preparatory step, we generalize the differential equation that determines the aberration kernel to general Doppler weight. This avoids the intermediate step of Doppler-weight raising and lowering operations in computations of the boost operator. We then clarify all the properties of the boost operator (e.g., raising and lowering operations, symmetries and commutation relations) and derive a formal operator differential equation for the boost operator. This differential equation allows us to quickly generate the boost operator for which we give exact expressions up to second order in v/c. For illustration, we then apply the boost operator to transformations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), validating that measurements of the lowest CMB multipoles do not allow determining the amplitude of the primordial CMB dipole. We also derive the kinematic corrections to the Thomson scattering process (to all orders in v/c), giving explicit expressions up to second order in v/c, showcasing an application of the boost operator in radiative transfer problems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of finite-temperature effects on cosmological parameters by artificial neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of finite-temperature quantum gravity effects on cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, by incorporating temperature-dependent quantum corrections into the Hubble parameter. For that purpose, we modify the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. We introduce new density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, arising from finite-temperature quantum gravity contributions, and analyze their influence on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum using advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and stochastic optimization. Our results reveal that $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ assumes a negative value, consistent with dimensional regularization in renormalization and that the presence of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ as well as $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ significantly enhances model accuracy. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the inclusion of these parameters improves the fit to 2018 Planck data, suggesting that finite-temperature quantum gravity effects play a non-negligible role in cosmological evolution. Although the Hubble tension persists, our findings highlight the potential of quantum gravitational corrections in refining cosmological models and motivate further investigation into higher-order thermal effects and polarization data constraints.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Higgs Inflation with ACT Observations through Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Higgs inflation model with nonminimal coupling, while disfavored by the 1$\sigma$ region of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) observational data, can be reconciled with the ACT data by incorporating the effects of reheating. In this paper, we consider reheating with a constant equation of state $w_{re}$. To simultaneously satisfy the ACT data and ensure that the temperature at the end of reheating is above the threshold required for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we find that the equation of state must satisfy $w_{re} \gtrsim 2/3$. For the special cases of $w_{ re} = 2/3$ and $w_{ re} = 1$, the number of e-folds during reheating must lie within the ranges $31.6 \leq N_{ re} \leq 32.8$ and $15.8 \leq N_{ re} \leq 27.3$, respectively. Our findings suggest that by considering reheating, a wide range of inflationary models, such as $R^2$ inflation, hilltop inflation, E-model inflation, and T-model inflation, can also be made consistent with the ACT observational data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>A simple optimisation for the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of the MeerKAT radio telescope's pulsar timing array programme (MPTA) is the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of nanohertz frequencies. Evidence for such a signal was recently announced by the MPTA and several other pulsar timing array (PTA) consortia. Given an array of pulsars and an observation strategy, we consider whether small adjustments to the observing schedule can provide gains in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for a stochastic GW background signal produced by a population of massive black hole binaries. Our approach uses a greedy algorithm to reallocate available integration time between pulsars in the array. The overall time dedicated to MPTA observing is kept constant so that there is only minimal disruption to the current observation strategy. We assume a GW signal consistent with those reported. For the sake of demonstrating our method, we also make several simplifying assumptions about the noise properties of the pulsars in the MPTA. Given these assumptions, we find that small adjustments to the observing schedule can provide an increased S/N by $\approx 20\%$ for a $10\,{\rm yr}$ PTA lifespan.</description>

      <title>The area and volume laws for entanglement of scalar fields in flat and cosmological spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the area and volume laws for entanglement of free quantum scalar fields. In addition to the entropy, we use the notion of the capacity of entanglement, which measures entropy fluctuations. We consider flat spacetimes as well as the curved ones relevant for cosmology. Moreover, we put special emphasis on quench phenomena and different geometries of the entangling surfaces. First, we show that, in the Minkowski spacetime, the capacity of entanglement, like entropy, exhibits the area law for two kinds of geometries of the entangling surfaces: the sphere and strip. Moreover, we show that the ratio of both quantities takes the same values for both surfaces. Next, we turn our attention to quenches. Namely, we analyse the dynamics of capacity; in particular, contribution of the volume and surface terms. Moreover, we compare these results with theoretical predictions resulting from the quasiparticles model. In the second part, we consider the above issues for the FLRW spaces; especially, for de Sitter space as well as a metric modeling the transition to radiation-dominated era. Finally, we analyse the abrupt quenches in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Fate of initially bound timelike geodesics in spherical boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson stars are horizonless compact objects and they could possess novel geodesic orbits under the equilibrium assumption, which differ from those in black hole backgrounds. However, unstable boson stars may collapse into black holes or migrate to stable states, resulting in an inability to maintain the initially bound geodesic orbits within the backgrounds of unstable boson stars. To elucidate the fate of initially bound geodesic orbits in boson stars, we present a study of geodesics within the spherical space-times of stable, collapsing, and migrating boson stars. We focus on timelike geodesics that are initially circular or reciprocating. We verify that orbits initially bound within a stable boson star persist in their bound states. For a collapsing boson star, we show that orbits initially bound and reciprocating finally either become unbound or plunge into the newly formed black hole, depending on their initial maximal radii. {For initially circular geodesics, we have discovered the existence of a critical radius. Orbits with radii below this critical value are found to plunge into the newly formed black hole, whereas those with radii larger than the critical radius continue to orbit around the vicinity of the newly formed black hole, exhibiting nonzero eccentricities}. For the migrating case, a black hole does not form. In this case, the reciprocating orbits span a wider radial range. For initially circular geodesics, orbits with small radii become unbound, and orbits with large radii remain bound with nonvanishing eccentricities. This geodesic study provides a novel approach to investigating the gravitational collapse and migration of boson stars.</description>

Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have shown promise in many sectors of cosmology. However, recent constraints from the speed of gravitational waves have put severe limits on the breadth of models such classes of theories can realize. In this work, we explore the possibility of a Horndeski Lagrangian that is equipped with two dilaton fields. The evolution of a two-dilation coupled cosmology is not well-known in the literature. We explore the tensor perturbations in order to assess the behavior of the model again the speed of gravitational wave constraint. Our main result is that this model exhibits of a class of cosmological theories that is consistent with this observational constraint.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the early universe in Einstein-Cartan theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein--Cartan theory is a generalization of general relativity that introduces spacetime torsion. In this paper, we perform phase space analysis to investigate the evolution of the early universe in Einstein--Cartan theory. By studying the stability of critical points in the dynamical system, we find that there exist two stable critical points which represent an Einstein static solution and an expanding solution, respectively. After analyzing the phase diagram of the dynamical system, we find that the early universe may exhibit an Einstein static state, an oscillating state, or a bouncing state. By assuming the equation of state $\omega$ can decrease over time $t$, the universe can depart from the initial Einstein static state, oscillating state, or bouncing state and then evolve into an inflationary phase. Then, we analyze four different inflationary evolution cases in Einstein--Cartan theory and find that a time-variable equation of state $\omega$ cannot yield values of $n_{s}$ and $r$ consistent with observations, while a time-invariant equation of state $\omega$ is supported by the Planck 2018 results. Thus, in Einstein--Cartan theory, the universe likely originates from a bouncing state rather than an Einstein static state or an oscillating state.</description>

Abstract: We analyze Planck scale induced modifications of the relativistic time dilation using data from the Muon Storage Ring experiment at CERN. By examining the lifetimes of muons, we establish, for the first time, a constraint on such quantum gravity-inspired deformations using this channel. The magnitude of the effect indicates that the study of cosmic rays is a well suited arena for this scenario. We show, that the spectrum of muons would be significantly affected for particles at the PeV scale. Since this later observation of the effect of time dilation is more indirect compared to a direct lifetime measurement, we encourage to perform a high precision measurement of the muon lifetime as a function of the muon's energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a few recent manuscripts, we used the affine connection to introduce two massless scalar fields in the Einstein-Palatini action. These fields lead to non-metricity. In this article, we will discuss the significance of these fields in inflation and dark energy. We will construct a Lagrangian formalism to include these scalar fields in a theory of gravity coupled with ordinary matter and radiation. We will find that these fields need not to be included in the actions of interacting gauge theories coupled with conserved fermionic vector currents as a part of the connection. The same remains valid for ordinary scalar fields. We can couple the connection-scalars with ordinary matter by adding suitable interaction terms. In this context, we will find that Stokes' theorem leads us to include the right-handed neutrinos in the electroweak theory in curved spacetime even with the Levi-Civita connection. This is required to obtain consistent equations of motion and anomaly-free conserved vector current for the neutrinos. Axial vector currents for different Dirac fields may remain anomalous. The right-handed neutrinos can be useful to explain neutrino oscillation and dark matter. We will also discuss the possibility of introducing massless finite integer spin particles using second rank symmetric traceless tensors with reference to the corresponding little group in flat spacetime. We will show that we can use massless (A,A) type fields in Minkowski space to introduce massless finite integer spin particles.</description>

Abstract: We derive new approximations for quintessence solutions that are simpler and an order of magnitude more accurate than anything available in the literature, which from an observational perspective \emph{makes numerical calculations superfluous}. For example, our tracking quintessence approximation yields $\sim 0.1\%$ maximum relative errors of $H(z)/H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}(z)$ for the observationally viable inverse power law scalar field potentials, and similarly for viable thawing quintessence models using two slow-roll parameters. The approximations are trivially computed from the scalar field potential and as an application we give \emph{analytic} expressions for the CPL parameters calculated from an arbitrary scalar field potential for thawing and tracking quintessence models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We disclose the thermodynamical properties of the apparent horizon in a nonsingular universe. We take into account the zero-point length correction to the gravitational potential and derive the modified entropy expression that includes zero-point length correction terms. We apply the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon as well as the emergent gravity scenario to derive the modified Friedmann equations. Further, we examine the time evolution of the total entropy, including the entropy of the apparent horizon and the matter field entropy inside the horizon and find out that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied. We also investigate the cosmological implications of the modified cosmology through zero-point length. We observe that the zero-point length correction does not change the general profile of the universe evolution, however, it shifts the time of the phase transition in a universe filled with matter and cosmological constant. We explore the age of the universe for our model and observe that the predicted age of the universe becomes larger compared to the standard cosmology. By calculating the explicit form of Ricci and Kretchmann invariants, we confirm that in our model, the initial singularity of the universe is removed. This is an expected result, because the main motivation for considering zero-point length correction in the gravitational potential is to remove singularity at the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic investigation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) for probe fields-massless/massive scalar and Dirac fields-around a charged loop quantum gravity black hole (LQG-BH) characterized by the quantum parameter $b_0$ and the charge parameter $Q$. Through spectral analysis of quasinormal frequencies (QNFs), we uncover a distinct overtone outburst driven by quantum gravity effects, prominently manifested in the scalar field spectrum with the multipole quantum number $l=0$. Both the outburst and its accompanying oscillatory patterns grow more pronounced with increasing overtone numbers. In contrast, massless scalar fields with $l&gt;1$ and Dirac fields exhibit delayed outburst development, with non-monotonic behavior dominating the first two overtones. Notably, increasing the charge $Q$ universally suppresses quantum-gravity-induced features, including outbursts, non-monotonicity, and oscillations. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting the presence of quasi-resonances in the massive scalar QNM spectrum, thereby illustrating the potential for the emergence of arbitrarily long-lived modes in this charged LQG spacetime. These findings establish a robust and universal interplay between quantum gravity effects and charge dynamics, providing new insights into the spectral properties of quantum-corrected BHs.</description>

      <title>Relativistic model of binary extreme-mass-ratio inspiral systems and their gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A binary extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (b-EMRI) is a hierarchical triple system consisting of a stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) orbiting a central Kerr supermassive black hole (SMBH). Although predicted by several astrophysical models, b-EMRIs pose a challenge in waveform modeling due to their complex three-body dynamics and strong relativistic effects. Here we take advantage of the hierarchical nature of b-EMRI systems to transform the internal motion of the small binary into global trajectories around the SMBH. This allows us to use black hole perturbation theory to calculate both the low-frequency gravitational waveform due to its EMRI nature and the high-frequency waveform generated by the inner motion of the BBH. When the inner binary's separation vanishes, our calculation recovers the standard relativistic adiabatic EMRI waveform. Furthermore, by including the high-frequency perturbation, we find a correction to the waveform as large as the adiabatic order when the frequency matches the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the SMBH, therefore supporting an earlier proof-of-concept study claiming that the small BBH can resonantly excite the QNMs of the SMBH. More importantly, we find that b-EMRIs can evolve faster than regular EMRIs due to this resonant dissipation through the high-frequency modes. These characteristics distinguish b-EMRI waveform templates from regular EMRI templates for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent and background-preserving gravity from an action: cosmological tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the observational implications of a gravitational model wherein the gravitational constant $G$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ exhibit scale-dependent behavior at the perturbative level, while preserving the General Relativity (GR) field equations at the background. This model is motivated by the potential influence of large-scale (infrared) Renormalization Group (RG) corrections to gravity and is constructed upon an effective action incorporating a scale definition via Lagrange multipliers. We explore the effects of these modifications during the recombination epoch with particular focus on their impact on the structure of acoustic oscillations. Additionally, we perform a comprehensive parameter fitting analysis using data from the Cosmic Microwave background (CMB), type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscilations (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortions (RSD). Our results indicate that the RG corrections here considered are consistent with the main predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and they slightly increase the uncertainties in the parameter estimations. Such small differences cannot be used to dismiss the current cosmological tensions. Although previous results indicated that this model is more flexible than $\Lambda$CDM regarding RSD data, potentially alleviating tensions, this advantage becomes negligible with the current extended data set. The framework maintains its theoretical consistency and foundation; however, unless further generalized, it cannot effectively address current cosmological issues.</description>

      <title>Novel electrically charged wormhole, black hole and black bounce exact solutions in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic exploration of exact solutions for electrically charged wormholes, black holes, and black bounces within the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) framework. HMPG combines features of the metric and Palatini formulations of modified gravity, offering a powerful approach to address challenges in General Relativity, particularly those related to cosmic acceleration and dark matter. We examine configurations characterized by a zero scalar potential under spherical symmetry, and present solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. A diverse set of solutions emerges, including traversable wormholes, black holes with double horizons, and ``black universe'' models in which spacetime beyond the horizon leads to an expanding cosmological solution rather than a singularity. Each configuration is categorized according to the properties of the scalar field, with an in-depth analysis of the horizon and throat structures, asymptotic behaviour, and singularities. These findings underscore the versatility of HMPG in capturing complex gravitational phenomena and broadens the scope of the theory, offering a robust framework for modelling gravitational phenomena across a range of astrophysical contexts. Future work will benefit from extending these solutions to include scalar potentials, addressing both early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, and applying observational data, such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Returning Back to Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have re-examined Mukhanov parametrization for inflationary equation of state, $1+\omega=\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, in the light of Planck 2018 results and latest bound of tensor-to-scalar ratio employing Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We have found that the current observational values of scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can be used efficiently to constrain the model parameters. The recent bound of $r&lt;0.032$ has been used to put an upper bound on one of the model parameter. Whereas 1-$\sigma$ bound of the scalar spectral index $0.9607\leq n_{_S}\leq 0.9691$ along with the upper bound of tensor-to-scalar ratio provided restriction on the other model parameter $1.50&lt;\alpha\leq2.20$. These bounds however depend on the number of e-foldings still left before the end of inflation and whenever $1.50&lt;\alpha\leq2.20$ we can find appropriate values of the other model parameter $\beta$ so that the observational predictions are in tune with the latest available inflationary observables. We have further utilized the predictions from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD in order to obtain bounds on the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us constrain the model parameters further. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity wave signal by these CMB missions may rule out Mukhanov parametrization.</description>

Abstract: The model of vacuum energy compensation due to interaction of a scalar field $\phi$ with curvature scalar of the form $\beta R \phi^2 f(\phi) $ is proposed. It is shown that with a simple power form of $f(\phi)$ the exponential expansion, induced by vacuum energy (or what is the same by cosmological constant), is transformed into canonical cosmological evolution of the universe dominated by relativistic matter.</description>

      <title>Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the vortex: quasinormal and quasibound spectra of rotating acoustic geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</description>

      <title>Lensing and wave optics in the strong field of a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. To derive this solution, we use the Newman-Janis algorithm and results from the non-complexification procedure. Interestingly, the solution we find may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby challenging the no-hair theorem. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics (``hair") affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a method to extract a set of time-series data using ``statistical independency" of each component. We applied ICA to extract gravitational wave (GW) signals directly from the detector data. Our idea is to extract a coherent signal that is included in multiple detectors and find it by shifting the data set around its arrival time. In this article, we report several tests using injected signals, and show that this method works for inspiral-wave events with a signal-to-noise ratio of $&gt;$ 15. We then applied the method to actual LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1-O3 events, and showed that the identification of the arrival time can be estimated more precisely than previously reported. This approach does not require templates of waveform, therefore it is attractive for testing theories of gravity, and for finding unknown GW.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model parameterized by $\zeta$, utilizing precision measurements from solar system experiments and astrophysical observations. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity (GR): (1) Light deflection constrained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar radio signals, (2) Shapiro time delay measurements from the Cassini mission, and (3) Mercury's perihelion precession determined by MESSENGER mission data. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Earth-orbiting LAGEOS satellites and the relativistic trajectory of the S2 star orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius $\rm{A}^*$ (Sgr $\rm{A}^{*}$). Our multi-probe approach reveals that the tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound $\zeta \lesssim 10^{-2}$. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantum gravity effects.</description>

Abstract: We model the light HESS J1731-347 compact object (of known stellar mass and radius) within Einstein's General Relativity imposing the Karmarkar condition in gravity for anisotropic stars. The three free parameters of the analytic solution are determined imposing the matching conditions at the surface of the star for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that the solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. Furthermore, we study the radial oscillation modes, and we compare to the ones corresponding to an isotropic star modeled by the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. A comparison between the large frequency separations is made as well.</description>

      <title>Evolution of precessing binary black holes on eccentric orbits using orbit-averaged evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most general bound binary black hole (BBH) system has an eccentric orbit and precessing spins. The detection of such a system with significant eccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical formation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve their spins and eccentricity from the larger separations at which the binary formed to the smaller separations at which it is detected, or vice versa. Knowledge of the precessional evolution of the binary's orbital angular momentum can also be used to twist up aligned-spin eccentric waveform models to create a spin-precessing eccentric waveform model. In this paper, we present a new publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessing BBHs using orbit-averaged post-Newtonian (PN) equations from the literature. The spin-precession dynamics is 2PN accurate, i.e., with the leading spin-orbit and spin-spin corrections. The evolution of orbital parameters (orbital frequency, eccentricity, and periastron precession), which follow the quasi-Keplerian parametrization, is 3PN accurate in the point particle terms and includes the leading order spin-orbit and spin-spin effects. All the spin-spin terms include the quadrupole-monopole interaction. The eccentricity enhancement functions in the fluxes use the high-accuracy hyperasymptotic expansions from Loutrel and Yunes [Classical Quantum Gravity {\bf 34} 044003 (2017)]. We discuss various features of the code and study the evolution of the orbital and spin-precession parameters of eccentric, precessing BBHs. In particular, we study the dependence of the spin morphologies on eccentricity, where we find that the transition point from one spin morphology to another can depend nonmonotonically on eccentricity, and the fraction of binaries in a given morphology at a given point in the evolution of a population depends on the instantaneous eccentricity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of entanglement island in the Karch-Randall braneworld, it has been conjectured and proven in general that entanglement island is not consistent with long-range (massless) gravity. In this paper, we provide a careful check of this conclusion in a model of massless gravity that is constructed using the Karch-Randall braneworld. We show that there is indeed no entanglement island and hence not a nontrivial Page curve due to the diffeomorphism invariance if we are studying the correct question which is though subtle. Moreover, we show that this conclusion is not affected by deforming the setup with the Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) terms. Furthermore, we show that the consistency of holography in this model will provide nontrivial constraints to the DGP parameters. This study provides an example that causality and holography in anti-de Sitter space can be used to constrain low energy effective theories. At the end, we clarify several subtleties in the braneworld gravity which are overlooked in the literature and we discuss the robustness of the above results against possible coarse-graining protocols to define a subregion in a gravitational theory.</description>

      <title>Quintessential early dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified model of early and late dark energy. We call it {\it quintessential early dark energy} model where early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field {\it i.e.}, two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential, which is chosen phenomenologically. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. But, at the perturbation level the potential shows significant difference with the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements. Even after the presence of required EDE solution in all four potentials we don't get any significant improvement in the value of $H_0$. The maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential. For other potentials the constraints are similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also see that the data prefers $\Lambda$CDM model over the considered scalar field models at least for the data combinations with Pantheon$+$ and Union3.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c &gt; 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c &lt; 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.</description>

      <title>The stress-energy tensor of an Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for a finite-size particle detector, which allows us to derive its stress-energy tensor. This tensor is obtained from a covariant Lagrangian that describes not only the quantum field that models the detector, $\phi_{\text{d}}$, but also the systems responsible for its localization: a complex scalar field, $\psi_{\text{c}}$, and a perfect fluid. The local interaction between the detector and the complex field ensures the square integrability of the detector modes, while the fluid serves to define the spatial profile of $\psi_{\text{c}}$, localizing it in space. We then demonstrate that, under very general conditions, the resulting energy tensor -- incorporating all components of the system -- is physically reasonable and satisfies the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>A relativistic QFT description for the interaction of a spin with a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze how non-relativistic effective models for the magnetic coupling of a spin to the electromagnetic field (proportional to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot \boldsymbol{B}$) emerge from a full quantum field theoretical description of charged fermionic fields with the quantum electromagnetic field. This allows us to keep track of relativistic corrections to the models commonly used in experimental spin physics. We discuss how this interaction compares to the usual simplified models used in relativistic quantum information.</description>

Abstract: We study a spatial-temporal structure of quantum fluctuations in the stress-energy tensor of zero-point modes for a scalar field in order to formulate a covariant model. The model describes an invariant vacuum contribution to the cosmological constant in the non-stationary coherent state in a finite volume. Bare and effective mean values of vacuum energy density are compared.</description>

      <title>An entropic puzzle in periodic dilaton gravity and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 2d dilaton gravity theories with a periodic potential, with special emphasis on sine dilaton gravity, which is holographically dual to double-scaled SYK. The periodicity of the potentials implies a symmetry under (discrete) shifts in the momentum conjugate to the length of geodesic slices. This results in divergences. The correct definition is to gauge this symmetry. This discretizes the geodesic lengths. Lengths below a certain threshold are null states. Because of these null states, the entropy deviates drastically from Bekenstein-Hawking and the Hilbert space becomes finite dimensional. The spacetimes have a periodic radial coordinate. These are toy models of 2d quantum cosmology with a normalizable wavefunction. We study two limiting dualities: one between flat space quantum gravity and the Heisenberg algebra, and one between topological gravity and the Gaussian matrix integral. We propose an exact density of states for certain classes of periodic dilaton gravity models.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the solar system via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the solar system. Photons with energy half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the solar system. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities of Q-strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As analogues of compact objects, solitons have attracted significant attention. We reveal that cylindrical Q-strings exhibit a dynamical instability to perturbations with wavelengths exceeding a threshold $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{c}$. This instability can destroy the invariance in the cylindrical direction, as a generation mechanism for Q-balls, similar to the formation of droplets. As the interface of Q-strings approaches a thin wall, this long-wavelength instability degenerates into the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with a threshold related only to the geometric radius $\lambda_{c}=2\pi R$. Such results indicate that Q-strings, like black strings, resemble low-viscosity fluids with surface tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Condensation Points of Fuzzy Dark Matter Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of a Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core condensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic relaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. In a generic scenario the BH merges with a pre-collapsed mini-cluster formed in a random location, once they share location the core-condensation starts withe the FDM density centered at the black hole that during the process acquires a profile consistent with that of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue problem. These results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM core condensation. Furthermore, we find that the central density of the resulting FDM core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its permanent motion relative to the FDM core during the evolution, produces a smaller core density for bigger BH masses; in this way the BH mass is a parameter leading to a new diversity of central FDM core densities. As a collateral result, for our analysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and found a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit FDM cores around BHs.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle.'' The governing equations (involving general relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source -- it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in magnetars: Exploring type-I and type-II states in toroidal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first two-dimensional general-relativistic analysis of superconducting regions in axially symmetric highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) models with toroidal magnetic fields. We investigate the topology and distribution of type-II and type-I superconducting regions for varying toroidal magnetic field strengths and stellar masses by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations using the XNS code. Our results reveal that the outer cores of low- to intermediate-mass magnetars sustain superconductivity over larger regions compared to higher-mass stars with non-trivial distribution of type-II and type-I regions. Consistent with previous one-dimensional (1D) models, we find that regardless of the gravitational mass, the inner cores of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields are devoid of $S$-wave proton superconductivity. Furthermore, these models contain non-superconducting, torus-shaped regions - a novel feature absent in previous 1D studies. Finally, we speculate on the potential indirect effects of superconductivity on continuous gravitational wave emissions from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J1843-1113, highlighting their relevance for future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, and long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. In this work, we explore the possibility that a "domain wall dominant (DWD)" phase existed in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor and exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with significant implications for future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Transitions in Cosmological Calibrators: A Resolution to the Hubble Tension from SH0ES Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension, characterized by discrepant measurements of the Hubble constant from early and late universe probes, remains one of the most significant challenges in cosmology. Building upon our previous analysis of individual parameter transitions in SH0ES data, we investigate the impact of simultaneous transitions in multiple Cepheid and SNIa calibration parameters at specific cosmic distances. We allow various combinations of transitions in Cepheid absolute magnitude ($M^W_H$), period-luminosity relation slope ($b_W$), metallicity coefficient ($Z_W$), and SNIa absolute magnitude ($M_B$). Our comprehensive analysis reveals a consistent preferred transition distance of approximately 23 Mpc across different parameter combinations. The most statistically favored model allows simultaneous transitions in $b_W$, $Z_W$, and $M_B$, yielding $\Delta \text{AIC} \simeq -9.2$ and $\Delta \text{BIC} \simeq -3.0$ compared to the baseline SH0ES model. This provides strong evidence for inhomogeneities in standard candle calibrations. We demonstrate that the post-transition SNIa absolute magnitude aligns more closely with CMB-based constraints, resulting in a reduced Hubble constant value that alleviates the tension. Our findings suggest that the Hubble tension might be resolved through proper modeling of calibration parameter inhomogeneities rather than requiring new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

Abstract: At the Galactic Centre, we can expect a population of a few tens of early extreme-mass ratio inspirals (E-EMRIs) and extremely large mass ratio inspirals (XMRIs). Depending on their evolutionary stage, they can be highly eccentric, with moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of tens or hundreds, or nearly circular, with SNRs as large as a few thousand. Their individual signals combine into a common signal, which can complicate the resolution of other types of sources. We have calculated the foreground signal of continuous E-EMRIs and XMRIs using a catalog based on the expected number of sources and a realistic phase-space distribution. The forest of E-EMRIs will cover a large portion of the LISA sensitivity curve, obscuring the signals of some massive black hole binaries, verification binaries, and harmonics of EMRIs in their polychromatic phase. The combined signal from XMRIs will be much weaker but still affect intermediate-mass black hole binaries. Due to the large SNR, this forest can be also found in other galactic nuclei, such as that of the Andromeda galaxy. Even under conservative assumptions, the forest created by E-EMRIs and XMRIs in our Galactic Centre will likely pose a challenge for resolving other types of sources, as their contribution is non-coherent and exhibits large SNRs.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to Neutrino-cooled Flows</title>

Abstract: When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in a tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a massive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas forms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and temperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be converted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a non-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended accretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star. The impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by approximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low accretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak magnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic field mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the atmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the accretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these results with more general initial conditions and describing the main features of the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of hypercritically accreting NSs.</description>
