      <title>Global rigidity of smooth ${\mathbb Z}\ltimes_\lambda{\mathbb R}$-actions on ${\mathbb T}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\lambda&gt;1$, we consider the locally free ${\mathbb Z}\ltimes_\lambda{\mathbb R}$ actions on ${\mathbb T}^2$. We show that, if the action is $C^r$ with $r\geq2$, then it is $C^{r-\epsilon}$-conjugate to an affine action generated by a hyperbolic automorphism and a linear translation flow along expanding eigen-direction of the automorphism. In contrast, there exists a $C^{1+\alpha}$-action which is semi-conjugate, but not topologically conjugate to an affine action.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multiday Extreme Precipitation Across Eastern Australia: A Dynamical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate new techniques for computing multiday extreme precipitation taken from recent theoretical advancements in extreme value theory in the framework of dynamical systems, using historical precipitation data along the eastern coast of Australia as a case study. We explore the numerical pitfalls of applying standard extreme value techniques to model multiday extremes. Then, we illustrate that our data conforms to the appropriate setting for the application of recently derived extreme value distributions for runs of extremes in the dynamical framework and adapt these to the non-stationary setting. Finally, we use these distributions to make more informed predictions on the return times and magnitudes of consecutive daily extreme precipitation and find changes in the dependence of increasing consecutive daily rainfall extremes on the Southern Oscillation Index. Although our case study is focused on extreme precipitation across eastern Australia, we emphasize that these techniques can be used to model expected returns and magnitudes of consecutive extreme precipitation events across many locations.</description>

      <title>Sun-Jupiter-Saturn System may exist: A verified computation of quasiperiodic solutions for the planar three body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present evidence of the stability of a simplified model of the Solar System, a flat (Newtonian) Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system with realistic data: masses of the Sun and the planets, their semi-axes, eccentricities and (apsidal) precessions of the planets close to the real ones. The evidence is based on convincing numerics that a KAM theorem can be applied to the Hamiltonian equations of the model to produce quasiperiodic motion (on an invariant torus) with the appropriate frequencies. To do so, we first use KAM numerical schemes to compute translated tori to continue from the Kepler approximation (two uncoupled two-body problems) up to the actual Hamiltonian of the system, for which the translated torus is an invariant torus. Second, we use KAM numerical schemes for invariant tori to refine the solution giving the desired torus. Lastly, the convergence of the KAM scheme for the invariant torus is (numerically) checked by applying several times a KAM iterative lemma, from which we obtain that the final torus (numerically) satisfies the existence conditions given by a KAM theorem.</description>

      <title>Data-driven cold starting of good reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using short histories of observations from a dynamical system, a workflow for the post-training initialization of reservoir computing systems is described. This strategy is called cold-starting, and it is based on a map called the starting map, which is determined by an appropriately short history of observations that maps to a unique initial condition in the reservoir space. The time series generated by the reservoir system using that initial state can be used to run the system in autonomous mode, to produce accurate forecasts of the time series under consideration immediately. By utilizing this map, the lengthy "washouts" that are necessary to initialize reservoir systems can be eliminated, enabling the generation of forecasts using any selection of appropriately short histories of the observations.</description>

      <title>Scattering between a vortex dipole and a point vortex: insights from a new phase plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering of a vortex dipole by a point vortex in the Helmholtz model of point-vortex interactions. We reduce a system of three vortices by stages to a one-degree-of-freedom conservative system. We relate properties of the scattering dynamics to features in the phase space of the reduced system. We first change variables to the Jacobi coordinates, followed by a Nambu reduction. This shows that the natural phase space of this problem is the upper sheet of a two-sheeted hyperboloid, which degenerates to an upper half-cone in a critical case. Gr\"obli (1877) derived the standard reduction of this system in which the system's state is represented by the lengths of the triangle's sides. The new coordinate system overcomes two related shortcomings of Gr\"obli's reduction that have made understanding the dynamics difficult: the lack of a phase plane and the singularity at all configurations in which the vortices are collinear. We then generalize the problem to consider when the circulation of the third, initially stationary, vortex differs from the circulations of the two that form the propagating dipole.</description>

      <title>Action Functional as Early Warning Indicator in the Space of Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neuroscience, scientists have some hypotheses on the brain's critical dynamics, which means the brain may stay in a phase transition state between ordered and disordered activities. Some tipping points, as a past of no return, can be critical for neural diseases. Therefore, a key question is how the critical brain hypothesis relates to pathological conditions compared with normal brain functionality.
  Action functional between two meta-stable states in stochastic dynamical systems is a good tool to study the critical transition and tipping. Here we extend the conventional Onsager-Machlup action functional of finding the most probable transition pathway to be looking for the evolutionary transition dynamics between two meta-stable invariant sets. Hence a rich theory from Schr\"odinger Bridge and Optimal Transport is brought in to solve this problem. Furthermore, different from various early warning indicators via statistics, bifurcation theory, information theory, statistical physics, topology, graph theory, we propose a novel viewpoint of early warning indicators in the space of probability measure, which facilitates us to build indicators based on action functional.
  To validate our framework, we apply this methodology to a Morris-Lecar model introduced to analyze the transition dynamics between a meta-stable state and the homo-clinic orbit. Besides, the real Alzheimer's data from ADNI database is also investigated to study the early warning signals of transition from healthy to pre-AD states. This framework not only extends the transition path to be pathway measures between two given densities on invariant sets but also shows potential ability for early warning indicators or biomarkers in complex diseases.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness for the solutions of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness and regularity of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations (SDAEs) with nonlinear, locally Lipschitz and monotone (2) coefficients of the form (1). The main difficulty is the fact that the operator A(.) is non-autonomous, i.~e. depends on t and the matrix $A(t)$ is singular for all $t\in \left[0,T\right]$. Our interest is in SDAE of index-1. This means that in order to solve the problem, we can transform the initial SDAEs into an ordinary stochastic differential equation with algebraic constraints. Under appropriate hypothesizes, the main result establishes the existence and uniqueness of the solution in $\mathcal{M}^p(\left[0, T\right], \mathbb{R}^n)$, $p\geq 2$, $p\in \mathbb{N}$. Several strong estimations and regularity results are also provided. Note that, in this paper, we use various techniques such as It\^o's lemma, Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality, and Young inequality.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Kernel Method for Learning Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A structure-preserving kernel ridge regression method is presented that allows the recovery of potentially high-dimensional and nonlinear Hamiltonian functions out of datasets made of noisy observations of Hamiltonian vector fields. The method proposes a closed-form solution that yields excellent numerical performances that surpass other techniques proposed in the literature in this setup. From the methodological point of view, the paper extends kernel regression methods to problems in which loss functions involving linear functions of gradients are required and, in particular, a differential reproducing property and a Representer Theorem are proved in this context. The relation between the structure-preserving kernel estimator and the Gaussian posterior mean estimator is analyzed. A full error analysis is conducted that provides convergence rates using fixed and adaptive regularization parameters. The good performance of the proposed estimator is illustrated with various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An inflated dynamic Laplacian to track the emergence and disappearance of semi-material coherent sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian methods continue to stand at the forefront of the analysis of time-dependent dynamical systems. Most Lagrangian methods have criteria that must be fulfilled by trajectories as they are followed throughout a given finite flow duration. This key strength of Lagrangian methods can also be a limitation in more complex evolving environments. It places a high importance on selecting a time window that produces useful results, and these results may vary significantly with changes in the flow duration. We show how to overcome this drawback in the tracking of coherent flow features. Finite-time coherent sets (FTCS) are material objects that strongly resist mixing in complicated nonlinear flows. Like other materially coherent objects, by definition they must retain their coherence properties throughout the specified flow duration. Recent work [Froyland and Koltai, CPAM, 2023] introduced the notion of semi-material FTCS, whereby a balance is struck between the material nature and the coherence properties of FTCS. This balance provides the flexibility for FTCS to come and go, merge and separate, or undergo other changes as the governing unsteady flow experiences dramatic shifts. The purpose of this work is to illustrate the utility of the inflated dynamic Laplacian introduced in [Froyland and Koltai, CPAM, 2023] in a range of dynamical systems that are challenging to analyse by standard Lagrangian means, and to provide an efficient meshfree numerical approach for the discretisation of the inflated dynamic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Stationary non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE: constructive proofs of existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a methodology for establishing constructive proofs of existence of smooth, stationary, non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation. Specifically, given an approximate solution $u_0$, we construct an approximate inverse for the linearization around $u_0$, enabling the development of a Newton-Kantorovich approach. Consequently, we derive a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique localized pattern in the vicinity of $u_0$. The verification of this condition is facilitated through a combination of analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, an additional condition is derived, establishing that the localized pattern serves as the limit of a family of periodic solutions (in space) as the period tends to infinity. The integration of analytical tools and meticulous numerical analysis ensures a comprehensive validation of this condition. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we present computer-assisted proofs for the existence of three distinct unbounded branches of periodic solutions in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation, all converging towards a localized planar pattern, whose existence is also proven constructively. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the measure of maximal entropy for the hereditary closure of a $\mathscr{B}$-free subshift has the Gibbs property if and only if the Mirsky measure of the subshift is purely atomic. This answers an open question asked by Peckner. Moreover, we show that $\mathscr{B}$ is taut whenever the corresponding Mirsky measure $\nu_\eta$ has full support. This is the converse theorem to a recent result of Keller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider time-periodic perturbations of single-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems and study their real-meromorphic nonintegrability in the Bogoyavlenskij sense using a generalized version due to Ayoul and Zung of the Morales-Ramis theory. The perturbation terms are assumed to have finite Fourier series in time, and the perturbed systems are rewritten as higher-dimensional autonomous systems having the small parameter as a state variable.We show that if the Melnikov functions are not constant, then the autonomous systems are not real-meromorphically integrable near homo- and heteroclinic orbits. Our result is not just an extension of previous results for homocliic orbits to heteroclinic orbits and provides a stronger conclusion than them for the case of homoclinic orbits. We illustrate the theory for two periodically forced Duffing oscillators and a periodically forced two-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Minimal Strong Foliations in Skew-products of Iterated Function Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study locally constant skew-product maps over full shifts of finite symbols with arbitrary compact metric spaces as fiber spaces. We introduce a new criterion to determine the density of leaves of the strong unstable (and strong stable) foliation, that is, for its minimality. When the fiber space is a circle, we show that both strong foliations are minimal for an open and dense set of robust transitive skew-products. We provide examples where either one foliation is minimal or neither is minimal. Our approach involves investigating the dynamics of the associated iterated function system (IFS). We establish the asymptotic stability of the phase space of the IFS when it is a strict attractor of the system. We also show that any transitive IFS consisting of circle diffeomorphisms that preserve orientation can be approximated by a robust forward and backward minimal, expanding, and ergodic (with respect to Lebesgue) IFS. Lastly, we provide examples of smooth robust transitive IFSs where either the forward or the backward minimal fails, or both.</description>

      <title>Khintchine-type double recurrence in abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Khintchine-type recurrence theorem for pairs of endomorphisms of a countable discrete abelian group. As a special case of the main result, if $\Gamma$ is a countable discrete abelian group, $\varphi, \psi \in End(\Gamma)$, and $\psi - \varphi$ is an injective endomorphism with finite index image, then for any ergodic measure-preserving $\Gamma$-system $\left( X, \mathcal{X}, \mu, (T_g)_{g \in \Gamma} \right)$, any measurable set $A \in \mathcal{X}$, and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the set of $g \in \Gamma$ for which $$\mu \left( A \cap T_{\varphi(g)}^{-1} A \cap T_{\psi(g)}^{-1} A \right) &gt; \mu(A)^3 - \varepsilon$$ is syndetic. This generalizes the main results of (Ackelsberg--Bergelson--Shalom, 2022) and essentially answers a question left open in that paper (Question 1.12).
  For the group $\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}^d$, we deduce that for any matrices $M_1, M_2 \in M_{d \times d}(\mathbb{Z})$ whose difference $M_2 - M_1$ is nonsingular, any ergodic measure-preserving $\mathbb{Z}^d$-system $\left( X, \mathcal{X}, \mu, (T_{\vec{n}})_{\vec{n} \in \mathbb{Z}^d} \right)$, any measurable set $A \in \mathcal{X}$, and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the set of $\vec{n} \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ for which $$\mu \left( A \cap T_{M_1 \vec{n}}^{-1} A \cap T_{M_2 \vec{n}}^{-1} A \right) &gt; \mu(A)^3 - \varepsilon$$ is syndetic, a result that was previously known only in the case $d = 2$.
  The key ingredients in the proof are: (1) a recent result obtained jointly with Bergelson and Shalom that says that the relevant ergodic averages are controlled by a characteristic factor closely related to the quasi-affine (or Conze--Lesigne) factor; (2) an extension trick to reduce to systems with well-behaved (with respect to $\varphi$ and $\psi$) discrete spectrum; and (3) a description of Mackey groups associated to quasi-affine cocycles over rotational systems with well-behaved discrete spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the dynamic behavior of the network SIR epidemic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model on a network of $n$ interacting subpopulations. We analyze the transient and asymptotic behavior of the infection dynamics in each node of the network. In contrast to the classical scalar epidemic SIR model, where the infection curve is known to be unimodal (either always decreasing over time, or initially increasing until reaching a peak and from then on monotonically decreasing and asymptotically vanishing), we show the possible occurrence of multimodal infection curves in the network SIR epidemic model with $n\ge2$ subpopulations. We then focus on the special case of rank-$1$ interaction matrices, modeling subpopulations of homogeneously mixing individuals with different activity rates, susceptibility to the disease, and infectivity levels. For this special case, we find $n$ invariants of motion and provide an explicit expression for the limit equilibrium point. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the equilibrium points. We then establish an upper bound on the number of changes of monotonicity of the infection curve at the single node level and provide sufficient conditions for its multimodality. Finally, we present some numerical results revealing that, in the case of interaction matrices with rank larger than $1$, the single nodes' infection curves may display multiple peaks.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of quasi-periodic discrete schr\"odinger operators with cantor spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct 1-dim difference Schr\"odinger operators with a class of Geverey potentials such that Cantor spectrum occurs together with the estimations of open spectral gaps. The proof is based on KAM and Moser-P\"oschel argument .</description>

      <title>Poisson suspensions without roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct rigid Poisson suspensions without roots. The discrete rational component in spectrum of an ergodic automorphism S prevents some roots from existing. If S is tensorly multiplied by an ergodic automorphism of the space with a sigma-finite measure, discrete spectrum disappears in this product, but like the smile of Cheshire Cat, the memory of it can remain in the form of the absence of roots. In additional conditions, this effect is inherited by the Poisson suspension over the above product. Starting from this idea, but without using the tensor product, we describe simple rank-one constructions for which the Poisson suspensions are rigid and have no roots.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Reducibility of $C^k$ Quasi-Periodic Cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes an extreme $C^k$ reducibility theorem of quasi-periodic $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ cocycles in the local perturbative region, revealing both the essence of Eliasson [Commun.Math.Phys.1992] and Hou-You [Invent.Math.2012] in respectively the non-resonant and resonant cases. By paralleling further the reducibility process with the almost reducibility, we are able to acquire the least initial regularity as well as the least loss of regularity for the whole KAM iterations. This, in return, makes various spectral applications of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators wide open.</description>

      <title>Structural, point-free, non-Hausdorff topological realization of Borel groupoid actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Becker--Kechris topological realization and change-of-topology theorems for Polish group actions in several directions. For Polish group actions, we prove a single result that implies the original Becker--Kechris theorems, as well as Sami's and Hjorth's sharpenings adapted levelwise to the Borel hierarchy; automatic continuity of Borel actions via homeomorphisms; and the equivalence of "potentially open" versus "orbitwise open" Borel sets. We also characterize "potentially open" $n$-ary relations, thus yielding a topological realization theorem for invariant Borel first-order structures. We then generalize to groupoid actions, and prove a result subsuming Lupini's Becker--Kechris-type theorems for open Polish groupoids, newly adapted to the Borel hierarchy, as well as topological realizations of actions on fiberwise topological bundles and bundles of first-order structures.
  Our proof method is new even in the classical case of Polish groups, and is based entirely on formal algebraic properties of category quantifiers; in particular, we make no use of either metrizability or the strong Choquet game. Consequently, our proofs work equally well in the non-Hausdorff context, for open quasi-Polish groupoids, and more generally in the point-free context, for open localic groupoids.</description>

      <title>Preserving Bifurcations through Moment Closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moment systems arise in a wide range of contexts and applications, e.g. in network modeling of complex systems. Since moment systems consist of a high or even infinite number of coupled equations, an indispensable step in obtaining a low-dimensional representation that is amenable to further analysis is, in many cases, to select a moment closure. A moment closure consists of a set of approximations that express certain higher-order moments in terms of lower-order ones, so that applying those leads to a closed system of equations for only the lower-order moments. Closures are frequently found drawing on intuition and heuristics to come up with quantitatively good approximations. In contrast to that, we propose an alternative approach where we instead focus on closures giving rise to certain qualitative features, such as bifurcations. Importantly, this fundamental change of perspective provides one with the possibility of classifying moment closures rigorously in regard to these features. This makes the design and selection of closures more algorithmic, precise, and reliable. In this work, we carefully study the moment systems that arise in the mean-field descriptions of two widely known network dynamical systems, the SIS epidemic and the adaptive voter model. We derive conditions that any moment closure has to satisfy so that the corresponding closed systems exhibit the transcritical bifurcation that one expects in these systems coming from the stochastic particle model.</description>

Abstract: We establish spectral, linear, and nonlinear stability of the vanishing and slow-moving travelling waves that arise as time asymptotic solutions to the Fisher-Stefan equation. Nonlinear stability is in terms of the limiting equations that the asymptotic waves satisfy.</description>
