      <title>Iterative Recommendations based on Monte Carlo Sampling and Trust Estimation in Multi-Stage Vehicular Traffic Routing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shortest-time route recommendations offered by modern navigation systems fuel selfish routing in urban vehicular traffic networks and are therefore one of the main reasons for the growth of congestion. In contrast, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) prefer to steer driver-vehicle systems (DVS) toward system-optimal route recommendations, which are primarily designed to mitigate network congestion. However, due to the misalignment in motives, drivers exhibit a lack of trust in the ITS. This paper models the interaction between a DVS and an ITS as a novel, multi-stage routing game where the DVS exhibits dynamics in its trust towards the recommendations of ITS based on counterfactual and observed game outcomes. Specifically, DVS and ITS are respectively modeled as a travel-time minimizer and network congestion minimizer, each having nonidentical prior beliefs about the network state. A novel approximate algorithm to compute the Bayesian Nash equilibrium, called ROSTER(Recommendation Outcome Sampling with Trust Estimation and Re-evaluation), is proposed based on Monte Carlo sampling with trust belief updating to determine the best response route recommendations of the ITS at each stage of the game. Simulation results demonstrate that the trust prediction error in the proposed algorithm converges to zero with a growing number of multi-stage DVS-ITS interactions and is effectively able to both mitigate congestion and reduce driver travel times when compared to alternative route recommendation strategies.</description>

      <title>Full Cooperation in Repeated Multi-Player Games on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly all living systems, especially humans, depend on collective cooperation for survival and prosperity. However, the mechanisms driving the evolution of cooperative behavior remain poorly understood, particularly in the context of simultaneous interactions involving multiple individuals, repeated encounters, and complex interaction structures. Here, we introduce a novel framework for studying repeated multi-player interactions in structured populations -- repeated multi-player games on hypergraphs -- where multiple individuals within each hyperedge engage in a repeated game, and each player can simultaneously participate in many games. We focus on public goods games, where individuals differ in their initial endowments, their allocation of endowments across games, and their productivity, which determines the impact of their contributions. Through Nash equilibrium analysis, we reveal the intricate interplay between full cooperation (all individuals contribute their entire endowments, maximizing collective benefits) and key factors such as initial endowments, productivity, contribution strategies, and interaction structure. Notably, while equal endowments are most effective in promoting full cooperation in homogeneous hypergraphs, they can hinder cooperation in heterogeneous hypergraphs, suggesting that equal endowments are not universally optimal. To address this, we propose two optimization strategies: one for policymakers to adjust endowment distributions and another for players to modify their contribution strategies. Both approaches successfully promote full cooperation across all studied hypergraphs. Our findings provide novel insights into the emergence of full cooperation, offering valuable guidance for both players and policymakers in fostering collective cooperation.</description>

      <title>An Application of Membrane Computing to Humanitarian Relief via Generalized Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural and political disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis, but also migration and refugees crisis, need quick and coordinated responses in order to support vulnerable populations. In such disasters, nongovernmental organizations compete with each other for financial donations, while people who need assistance suffer a lack of coordination, congestion in terms of logistics, and duplication of services. From a theoretical point of view, this problem can be formalized as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) problem. This is a generalization of the Nash equilibrium problem, where the agents' strategies are not fixed but depend on the other agents' strategies. In this paper, we show that Membrane Computing can model humanitarian relief as a GNE problem. We propose a family of P systems that compute GNE in this context, and we illustrate their capabilities with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as a case study.</description>

      <title>Mosaic: Client-driven Account Allocation Framework in Sharded Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent account allocation studies in sharded blockchains are typically miner-driven, requiring miners to perform global optimizations for all accounts to enhance system-wide performance. This forces each miner to maintain a complete copy of the entire ledger, resulting in significant storage, communication, and computation overhead.
  In this work, we explore an alternative research direction by proposing Mosaic, the first client-driven framework for distributed, lightweight local optimization. Rather than relying on miners to allocate all accounts, Mosaic enables clients to independently execute a local algorithm to determine their residing shards. Clients can submit migration requests to a beacon chain when relocation is necessary. Mosaic naturally addresses key limitations of miner-driven approaches, including the lack of miner incentives and the significant overhead. While clients are flexible to adopt any algorithm for shard allocation, we design and implement a reference algorithm, Pilot, to guide them. Clients execute Pilot to maximize their own benefits, such as reduced transaction fees and confirmation latency.
  On a real-world Ethereum dataset, we implement and evaluate Pilot against state-of-the-art miner-driven global optimization solutions. The results demonstrate that Mosaic significantly enhances computational efficiency, achieving a four-order-of-magnitude reduction in computation time, with the reduced input data size from 1.44 GB to an average of 228.66 bytes per account. Despite these efficiency gains, Pilot introduces only about a 5% increase in the cross-shard ratio and maintains approximately 98% of the system throughput, demonstrating a minimal trade-off in overall effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Constant Approximation for Weighted Nash Social Welfare with Submodular Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of assigning items to agents so as to maximize the \emph{weighted} Nash Social Welfare (NSW) under submodular valuations. The best-known result for the problem is an $O(nw_{\max})$-approximation due to Garg, Husic, Li, Vega, and Vondrak~\cite{GHL23}, where $w_{\max}$ is the maximum weight over all agents. Obtaining a constant approximation algorithm is an open problem in the field that has recently attracted considerable attention.
  We give the first such algorithm for the problem, thus solving the open problem in the affirmative. Our algorithm is based on the natural Configuration LP for the problem, which was introduced recently by Feng and Li~\cite{FL24} for the additive valuation case. Our rounding algorithm is similar to that of Li \cite{Li25} developed for the unrelated machine scheduling problem to minimize weighted completion time. Roughly speaking, we designate the largest item in each configuration as a large item and the remaining items as small items. So, every agent gets precisely 1 fractional large item in the configuration LP solution. With the rounding algorithm in \cite{Li25}, we can ensure that in the obtained solution, every agent gets precisely 1 large item, and the assignments of small items are negatively correlated.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Tullock Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the algorithmic complexity for computing the Nash equilibrium in the extensively studied Tullock Contest game. The (possibly heterogeneous) elasticity parameter $r_i$ determines whether a contestant $i$'s cost function is convex or concave. Our core conceptual insight is that the domains of $r_i$ governs the complexity for solving Tullock contents. This is illustrated by our following complete set of algorithmic results.
  - When at most $O(\log n)$ number of contestants have $r_i \in (1,2]$, we show polynomial-time algorithms to determine the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), and compute a PNE whenever it exists. Notably, this result is proved under three different regimes, each via quite different techniques: (1) all $r_i \leq 1$, (2) all $r_i &gt; 2$, and (3) a mixed situation with at most $O(\log n)$ number of $r_i \in (1, 2]$.
  - When polynomially many contestants have $r_i \in (1,2]$, we prove that determining the existence of a PNE is NP-complete. In response to this hardness result, we design a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) that finds an $\epsilon$-PNE when an exact PNE exists.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>

      <title>Buyer-Initiated Auction Mechanism for Data Redemption in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised privacy concerns over user data, leading to regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). With the essential toolbox provided by machine unlearning, AI service providers are now able to remove user data from their trained models as well as the training datasets, so as to comply with such regulations. However, extensive data redemption can be costly and degrade model accuracy. To balance the cost of unlearning and the privacy protection, we propose a buyer-initiated auction mechanism for data redemption, enabling the service provider to purchase data from willing users with appropriate compensation. This approach does not require the server to have any a priori knowledge about the users' privacy preference, and provides an efficient solution for maximizing the social welfare in the investigated problem.</description>
