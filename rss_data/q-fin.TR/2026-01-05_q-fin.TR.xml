      <title>Second Thoughts: How 1-second subslots transform CEX-DEX Arbitrage on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of reducing Ethereum slot time on decentralized exchange activity, with a focus on CEX-DEX arbitrage behavior. We develop a trading model where the agent's DEX transaction is not guaranteed to land, and the agent explicitly accounts for this execution risk when deciding whether to pursue arbitrage opportunities. We compare agent behavior under Ethereum's default 12-second slot time environment with a faster regime that offers 1-second subslot execution. The simulations, calibrated to Binance and Uniswap v3 data from July to September 2025, show that faster slot times increase arbitrage transaction count by 535% and trading volume by 203% on average. The increase in CEX-DEX arbitrage activity under 1-second subslots is driven by the reduction in variance of both successful and failed trade outcomes, increasing the risk-adjusted returns and making CEX-DEX arbitrage more appealing.</description>

      <title>A Midsummer Meme's Dream: Investigating Market Manipulations in the Meme Coin Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From viral jokes to a billion-dollar phenomenon, meme coins have become one of the most popular segments in cryptocurrency markets. Unlike utility-focused crypto assets like Bitcoin, meme coins derive value primarily from community sentiment, making them vulnerable to manipulation. This study presents an unprecedented cross-chain analysis of the meme coin ecosystem, examining 34,988 tokens across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. We characterize their tokenomics and track their growth in a three-month longitudinal analysis. We discover that among high-return tokens (&gt;100%), an alarming 82.8% show evidence of artificial growth strategies designed to create a misleading appearance of market interest. These include wash trading and a new form of manipulation we define as Liquidity Pool-Based Price Inflation (LPI), where small strategic purchases trigger dramatic price increases. We find that profit extraction schemes, such as pump and dumps and rug pulls, typically follow initial manipulations like wash trading or LPI, indicating how early manipulations create the foundation for later exploitation. We quantify the economic impact of these schemes, identifying over 17,000 victimized addresses with realized losses exceeding $9.3 million. These findings reveal that combined manipulations are widespread among high-performing meme coins, suggesting that their dramatic gains are often driven by coordinated efforts rather than natural market dynamics.</description>
