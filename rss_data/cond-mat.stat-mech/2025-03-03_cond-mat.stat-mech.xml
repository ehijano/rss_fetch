      <title>Mean-field approximation and phase transitions in an Ising-voter model on directed regular random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that on directed graphs, the correlations between neighbours of a given site vanish and thus simple mean-field-like arguments can be used to describe exactly the behaviour of Ising-like systems. We analyse heterogeneous modifications of such models where a fraction of agents is driven by the voter or the antivoter dynamics. It turns out that voter agents do not affect the dynamics of the model and it behaves like a pure Ising model. Antivoter agents have a stronger impact since they act as a kind of noise, which weakens a ferromagnetic ordering. Only when Ising spins are driven by the heat-bath dynamics, the behaviour of the model is correctly described by the mean-field approximation. The Metropolis dynamics generates some additional correlations that render the mean-field approach approximate. Simulations on annealed networks agree with the mean-field approximation but for the model with antivoters and with the Metropolis dynamics only its heterogeneous version provides such an agreement. Calculation of the Binder cumulant confirms that critical points in our models with the heat-bath dynamics belong to the Ising mean-field universality class. For the Metropolis dynamics, the phase transition is most likely discontinuous, at least for not too many antivoters.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced Diffusivity of an Axisymmetric Brownian Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rigid axisymmetric particle with hydrodynamic anisotropy exhibits gliding motion in a quiescent Newtonian fluid under gravity. When Brownian motion is significant, the orientation of the particle fluctuates during sedimentation. We perform an analytical calculation for this sedimentation process. Our results show that gravity can significantly enhance the spatial diffusion of the particle. In addition to Brownian diffusion, gravity induces an additional apparent diffusivity. This gravity-induced diffusivity increases quadratically with the sedimentation P\'eclet number in the high P\'eclet number regime and is further enhanced by hydrodynamic anisotropy when the particle shape deviates from a sphere at a fixed P\'eclet number. When the centers of mass and buoyancy deviate from the hydrodynamic center, the particle tends to align with the direction of gravity. This alignment reduces the effective translational resistance along the gravity direction, thereby increasing the sedimentation velocity. At a given P\'eclet number, the horizontal diffusivity exhibits a peak before converging to the normal diffusion constant as the center deviation becomes larger.</description>

      <title>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). In the present study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic DCs that are positive and non-zero. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, the eventual absorption is certain. We also show that compared to diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average of a stochastic DC, in diffusion with the stochastic DC, there are particles that reach the absorbing boundary earlier. The approximate proportion of preceding particles is determined by the probability distribution of the time average of a stochastic DC for a given distance to the absorbing boundary. In addition, when particles begin to reach the absorbing boundary before the time change in a stochastic DC occurs, a stochastic DC with a larger supremum leads to an earlier arrival of particles at the absorbing boundary even if the ensemble averages of stochastic DCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, three more properties are revealed. The mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach the absorbing boundary, the exact proportion of preceding particles is almost zero and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties of diffusion with an ergodic DC result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the ensemble average. For three-dimensional diffusion with a spherical absorbing boundary, we obtain essentially the same results, except that the eventual absorption is not certain. Our results suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of quantum void where the flow of time is deduced directly from quantum fluctuations and the consequent particle-antiparticle creations. Given a certain number of space-like separated pair creation events, assumed to happen all at the same initial time, we show that past and future can be foliated into a sequence of adapted manifolds based on how many events causally influence them. We also give an explicit construction for the simplest case of one space dimension.</description>

      <title>Influence of boundary geometry on active patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanochemical patterns arising in the actomyosin cortex drive many cellular processes. Here we consider a hydrodynamic model for the actomyosin cortex of cells and study the sensitivity of the emergent patterns to both physical parameters and the geometry of the confining domain. We first establish a general framework for the Galerkin analysis of such patterns far from the linear stability regime on an arbitrary two-dimensional domain. In the case of a circular disk, our analytical results predict transitions from isotropic to anisotropic patterns upon changing the strength of the active stress and the turnover rate. We confirm the existence of these genuine nonlinear bifurcations by an explicit numerical analysis of our model. Extending our numerical analysis to harmonic deformations of the circular disk, we show that the emergent patterns are also sensitive to the curvature of the domain. In particular, the actomyosin patterns resulting from our study closely resemble those seen in cells confined to micropatterned substrates. Our study demonstrates the role of geometry in controlling patterns within the context of a simple model for the actomyosin cortex.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian velocity distributions Maxwell would understand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1988, Constantino Tsallis proposed an extension of the Boltzmann statistical mechanics by postulating a new entropy formula, $S_q = k_B\ln_q W$, where $W$ is the number of microstates accessible to the system, and $\ln_q$ defines a deformation of the logarithmic function. This ``top-down" , approach recovers the celebrated Boltzmann entropy in the limit $q \rightarrow 1$ since $S_1 = k_B\ln W$. However, for $q\neq 1$ the entropy is non-additive and has been successfully applied for a variety of phenomena ranging from plasma physics to cosmology. For a system of particles, Tsallis' formula predicts a large class of power-law velocity distributions reducing to the Maxwellian result only for a particular case. Here a more pedagogical ``bottom-up" path is adopted. We show that a large set of power-law distributions for an ideal gas in equilibrium at temperature T is derived by slightly modifying the seminal Maxwell approach put forward in 1860. The emergence of power-laws velocity distribution is not necessarily related with the presence of long-range interactions. It also shed some light on the long-standing problem concerning the validity of the zeroth law of thermodynamics in this context. Potentially, since the new method highlights the value of hypotheses in the construction of a basic knowledge, it may have an interesting pedagogical and methodological value for undergraduate and graduate students of physics and related areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersal is often used by living beings to gather information from conspecifics, integrating it with personal experience to guide decision-making. This mechanism has only recently been studied experimentally, facilitated by advancements in tracking animal groups over extended periods. Such studies enable the analysis of the adaptive dynamics underlying sequential decisions and collective choices. Here, we present a theoretical framework based on the Voter Model to investigate these processes. The model, originally designed to study opinion or behavioral consensus within groups through imitation, is adapted to include the prospection of others' decisions as a mechanism for updating personal criteria. We demonstrate that several properties of our model (such as average consensus times and polarization dynamic) can be analytically mapped onto those of the classical Voter Model under simplifying assumptions. Finally, we discuss the potential of this framework for studying more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to accounting for correlations in evolution over time of an open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17210v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A projection operator is introduced, which exactly transforms the inhomogeneous Nakajima--Zwanzig generalized master equation for the relevant part of a system +bath statistical operator, containing the inhomogeneous irrelevant term comprising the initial corrrelations, into the homogeneous equation accounting for initial correlations in the kernel governing its evolution. No "molecular chaos"-like approximation has been used. The obtained equation is equivalent to completely closed (homogeneous) equation for the statistical operator of a system of interest interacting with a bath. In the Born approximation (weak system-bath interaction) this equation can be presented as the time-local Redfield-like equation with additional terms caused by initial correlations. As an application, a quantum oscillator, interacting with a Boson field and driven from a Gibbs initial equilibrium system+bath state by an external force, is considered. All terms determining the oscillator evolution over time are explicitly calculated at all timescales. It is shown, how the initial correlations influence the evolution process. It is also demonstrated, that at the large timescale this influence vanishes, and the evolution equation for the quantum oscillator statistical operator acquires the Lindblad form..</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generic non-phase invariant Hamiltonian model that governs the dynamics of nonlinear dispersive waves. We give evidence that initial data characterized by random phases naturally evolve into phase correlations between positive and negative wavenumbers, leading to the emergence of non-zero anomalous correlators and negative frequencies. Using analytical techniques, we show that anomalous correlators develop on a timescale of $O(1/\epsilon)$, earlier than the kinetic timescale. Our theoretical predictions are validated through direct numerical simulations of the deterministic system.</description>

Abstract: The rapid evolution and global impact of coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, underscore the importance of understanding their molecular mechanisms in detail. This study focuses on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the Spike protein of these viruses, a critical element for viral entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor. We investigate the sequence variations in the RBM across SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and its early variants of concern (VOCs). Utilizing multicanonical simulations and microcanonical analysis, we examine how these variations influence the folding dynamics, thermostability, and solubility of the RBMs. Our methodology includes calculating the density of states (DoS) to identify structural phase transitions and assess thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to model the solubility of the RBMs in aqueous environments. This methodology is expected to elucidate structural and functional differences in viral evolution and pathogenicity, likely improving targeted treatments and vaccines.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Approaches to Lattice Gauge Theories: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their broad applicability, gauge theories (GTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from high-energy physics to condensed matter. Their formulations on lattices, lattice gauge theories (LGTs), can be studied, among many other methods, with tools coming from statistical mechanics lattice models, such as mean field methods, which are often used to provide approximate results. Applying these methods to LGTs requires particular attention due to the intrinsic local nature of gauge symmetry, how it is reflected in the variables used to formulate the theory, and the breaking of gauge invariance when approximations are introduced. This issue has been addressed over the decades in the literature, yielding different conclusions depending on the formulation of the theory under consideration. In this article, we focus on the mean field theoretical approach to the analysis of GTs and LGTs, connecting both older and more recent results that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been compared in a pedagogical manner. After a brief overview of mean field theory in statistical mechanics and many-body systems, we examine its application to pure LGTs with a generic compact gauge group. Finally, we review the existing literature on the subject, discussing the results obtained so far and their dependence on the formulation of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the recently discovered finite-time dynamical phase transition in the non-equilibrium relaxation of Ising magnets after a temperature quench. The transition is characterized by a sudden switch in the relaxation dynamics and it occurs at a sharp critical time. While previous works have focused either on mean-field interactions or on investigating the critical time, we analyze the critical fluctuations at the phase transition in the nearest-neighbor Ising model on a square lattice using Monte Carlo simulations. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the critical exponents for the transition. In two spatial dimensions, we find that the exponents are consistent with those of the two-dimensional Ising universality class when the system is initially in the vicinity of the critical point. For initial temperatures below the critical one, however, the critical exponents differ from the Ising-exponents, indicating a distinct dynamical critical phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the standard bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold for non-Hermitian systems in which also new phenomena such as exceptional points do occur. Here we study by analytical and numerical means a paradigmatic one-dimensional non-Hermitian model with dimerization, asymmetric hopping, and imaginary staggered potentials. We present analytical solutions for the singular-value and the eigenspectrum of this model with both open and closed boundary conditions. We explicitly demonstrate that the proper bulk-boundary correspondence is between topological winding numbers in the periodic case and singular values, {\it not eigenvalues}, in the open case. These protected singular values are connected to hidden edge modes which only become exact zero-energy eigenmodes in the semi-infinite chain limit. We also show that a non-trivial topology leads to protected eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we find that the model has a so far overlooked phase where exceptional points become dense in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range correlations manifested as power spectral density scaling $1/f^\beta$ for frequency $f$ and a range of exponents $\beta$ are investigated for a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with distributed durations $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of diffusion is one of the deepest physical phenomena observed in many-body interacting, chaotic systems. But establishing rigorously that correlation functions, say of the spin, expand diffusively, remains one of the most important problems of mathematical physics. We establish for the first time, with Lindbladian evolution, a lower bound on spin diffusion in chaotic, translation-invariant, nearest-neighbor open quantum spin-1/2 chain satisfying a local detailed-balance condition and strong conservation of magnetisation. The bound is strictly positive if and only if the local quantum jumps transport spin. Physically, the bound comes from the spreading effects of initial-state macroscopic fluctuations, a mechanism which occurs whenever spin is an interacting ballistic mode. Chaoticity means that the Hilbert space of extensive charges is spanned by magnetisation; we expect this to be generic. Our main tool is the Green-Kubo formula, the mathematical technique of projection over quadratically extensive charges, and appropriate correlation decay bounds recently established. Because Lindbladian dynamics is not reversible, the Green-Kubo spin diffusion strength includes a contribution due to irreversibility, which we interpret as encoding the hydrodynamic entropy production that may occur in the forgotten environment. This, we show, vanishes for certain choices of interaction parameters, for which the Lindbladian dynamics becomes reversible. Our methods can be extended to finite or short ranges, higher spins, and other non-Hamiltonian systems such as quantum circuits. As we argue, according to the theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, we further expect these systems to display superdiffusion, and thus have infinite diffusivity; however this is still beyond the reach of mathematical rigour.</description>

      <title>Temperature as Joules per Bit</title>

Abstract: In statistical mechanics, entropy is defined as a fundamental quantity. However, its unit, J/K, involves that of temperature, which is only subsequently defined - and defined in terms of entropy. This circularity arises with the introduction of Boltzmann's constant into the very expression of entropy. The J/K carried by the constant prevents entropy from finding a unit of its own while simultaneously obfuscating its informational nature. Following the precepts of information theory, we argue that entropy is well measured in bits and coincides with information capacity at thermodynamic equilibrium. Consequently, not only is the temperature of a system in equilibrium expressed in J/bit, but it acquires a clear meaning: It is the cost in energy to increase its information capacity by 1 bit. Viewing temperature as joules per bit uncovers the strong duality exhibited by Gibbs long ago between available capacity and free energy. It also simplifies Landauer's cost and clarifies that it is a cost of displacement, not of erasure. Replacing the kelvin with the bit as an SI unit would remove Boltzmann's constant from the seven defining constants.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>

Abstract: The critical behaviour of the classical (thermal) phase transition (CPT) of the Ising model is in the same universality class of the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the $\phi^4$ Quantum Field Theory (QFT), this being a paradigmatic example of the relation between a CPT and its quantum counterpart QPT. It is well known that a classical system in $d$ dimension is -- for short-range interactions -- in the same universality class of the same model in $d-1$ spatial dimension at $T=0$. Nevertheless, to extend the renormalization group (RG) equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies may lead to subtelties and even to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow, as we comment more in the text. Our goal in this work is to discuss this issue and map out the QPT-CPT diagram focusing as an example on the $\phi^4$ QFT, revisiting its relation to the well-known QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. To this aim, we propose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimesionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its QPT-CPT phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>

Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Replica Symmetry Breaking under the Nishimori conditions in epidemic inference on graphs</title>

Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.</description>
