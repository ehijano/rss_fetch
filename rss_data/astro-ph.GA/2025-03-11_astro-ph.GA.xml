      <title>A panchromatic view of N2CLS GOODS-N: the evolution of the dust cosmic density since z~7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) To understand early star formation, it is essential to determine the dust mass budget of high-redshift galaxies. Sub-millimeter rest-frame emission, dominated by cold dust, is an unbiased tracer of dust mass. The NIKA2 camera conducted a deep blank field survey at 1.2 and 2.0 mm in the GOODS-N field as part of the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS), detecting 65 sources with SNR&gt;=4.2. Thanks to a dedicated interferometric program with NOEMA and other high-angular resolution data, we identify the multi-wavelength counterparts of these sources and resolve them into 71 individual galaxies. We build detailed SEDs and assign a redshift to 68 of them, over the range 0.6&lt;z&lt;7.2. We fit these SEDs using MBB and Draine &amp; Li (2007) models, and the panchromatic approaches MAGPHYS, CIGALE, and SED3FIT, thus deriving their dust mass, M(dust), infrared luminosity (LIR), and stellar mass, M(star). Eight galaxies require an AGN-torus component and other six require an unextinguished young stellar population. A significant fraction of our galaxies are classified as starbursts based on their position on the M(star) versus SFR plane or their depletion timescales. We compute the dust mass function in three redshift bins (1.6&lt;z&lt;=2.4, 2.4&lt;z&lt;=4.2 and 4.2&lt;z&lt;=7.2) and determine the Schechter function that best describes it. We observe an increase of the dust cosmic density, rho(dust), by at least an order of magnitude from z~7 to z~1.5, consistent with theoretical predictions. At lower redshift the evolution flattens; significant differences exist between results obtained with different selections and methods. The superb GOODS-N dataset enabled a systematic investigation into the dust properties of distant galaxies. N2CLS holds promise for combining these deep field findings with the wide COSMOS field into a self-consistent analysis of dust in galaxies both near and far.</description>

      <title>Where Have All the Little Red Dots Gone? Supermassive Black Hole Binary Dynamics and its Impact on Galaxy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 6$, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), "little red dots" (LRDs). A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct $N$-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few $\sim$100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by $z&lt;4$. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.</description>

      <title>The $H_2$ angular momentum -- mass relation of local disc galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the molecular specific angular momentum-mass ($j_{H_2}-M_{H_2}$) relation using a sample of 51 nearby disc galaxies from the PHANGS-ALMA survey with deep, high-resolution molecular gas rotation curves and surface density profiles. For the very first time, using a statistical sample, we report the discovery of a well-defined $j_{H_2}-M_{H_2}$ relation. We quantify the scaling law by fitting a power-law with a Bayesian framework, finding $j_{H_2} \propto M_{H_2}^{0.53}$. This slope closely resembles the well-known stellar $j_{\ast}$-$M_{\ast}$ (Fall) relation, highlighting the dynamical connection between molecular gas and stars. We show that the $j_{H_2}-M_{H_2}$ relation cannot be fully explained by analytic models of disc stability but instead is well recovered with more complex physics as implemented in the Shark semi-analytical model. These findings demonstrate the power of our novel $j_{H_2}-M_{H_2}$ relation in testing galaxy evolution theories and setting new constraints for models and simulations which aim to reproduce a realistic interstellar medium. Additionally, our findings provide a critical benchmark for upcoming high-redshift studies of molecular gas kinematics, offering a local baseline to study the evolution of cold gas dynamics across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Galaxy mass profiles with convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies is particularly challenging due to projection effects and the unknown shape of their velocity anisotropy profile. Our goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of recovering dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies from line-of-sight stellar data. Traditionally, this task relies on time-consuming methods that require profile parameterization and assume dynamical equilibrium and spherical symmetry. We train a convolutional neural network model using various sets of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. By extracting projected stellar data from the simulated galaxies and feeding it into the model, we obtain the posterior distribution of the dynamical mass profile at ten different radii. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of existing literature mass estimators on our dataset. Our model achieves more accurate results than any literature mass estimator while also providing enclosed mass estimates at radii where no previous estimators exist. We confirm that the posterior distributions produced by the model are well-calibrated, ensuring they provide meaningful uncertainties. However, issues remain, as the method loses performance when trained on one set of simulations and applied to another, highlighting the importance of improving the generalization of ML methods trained on specific galaxy simulations.</description>

      <title>Study of Open Star Clusters Using the Gaia DR3: I- Poorly Studied King 2 and King 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize photometric and kinematic data from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and the {\sc ASteCA} package to analyze the sparsely studied open clusters, King 2 and King 5. For King 2, we identify 340 probable members with membership probabilities exceeding 50\%. Its mean proper motion components are determined as $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-1.407 \pm 0.008, -0.863 \pm 0.012)$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its limiting radius is derived as $6.94_{-1.06}^{+0.22}$ arcminutes based on radial density profiles. The cluster has an estimated age of $4.80 \pm 0.30$ Gyr, a distance of $6586 \pm 164$ pc, and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.25$ dex ($z = 0.0088$). We detect 17 blue straggler stars (BSSs) concentrated in its core, and its total mass is estimated to be $356 \pm 19~M_{\odot}$. The computed apex motion is $(A_o,~D_o) = (-142^\circ.61 \pm 0^\circ.08, -63^\circ.58 \pm 0^\circ.13)$. Similarly, King 5 consists of 403 probable members with mean proper motion components $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-0.291 \pm 0.005, -1.256 \pm 0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and a limiting radius of $11.33_{-2.16}^{+5.45}$ arcminutes. The cluster's age is determined as $1.45 \pm 0.10$ Gyr, with a distance of $2220 \pm 40$ pc and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.15$ dex ($z = 0.0109$). We identify 4 centrally concentrated BSSs, and the total mass is estimated as $484 \pm 22~M_{\odot}$. The apex motion is calculated as $(A_o,~D_o) = (-115^\circ.10 \pm 0^\circ.09, -73^\circ.16 \pm 0^\circ.12)$. The orbital analysis of King 2 and King 5 indicates nearly circular orbits, characterized by low eccentricities and minimal variation in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. King 2 and King 5 reach maximum heights of $499 \pm 25$ pc and $177 \pm 2$ pc from the Galactic plane, respectively, confirming their classification as young stellar disc population.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Abundance Variations in the Milky Way's High-$\alpha$ Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using multi-element abundances from the SDSS APOGEE survey, we investigate the origin of abundance variations in Milky Way (MW) disk stars on the "high-$\alpha$ plateau," with $-0.8\leq\rm{[Fe/H]}\leq-0.4$ and $0.25\leq\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\leq0.35$. The elevated [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios of these stars imply low enrichment contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), but it is unclear whether their abundance patterns reflect pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) enrichment. We find that plateau stars with higher [Fe/Mg] ratios also have higher [X/Mg] ratios for other iron-peak elements, suggesting that the [Fe/Mg] variations in the plateau population do reflect variations in the SNIa/CCSN ratio. To quantify this finding, we fit the observed abundance patterns with a two-process model, calibrated on the full MW disk, which represents each star's abundances as the sum of a prompt CCSN process with amplitude $A_{\text{cc}}$ and a delayed SNIa process with amplitude $A_{\text{Ia}}$. This model is generally successful at explaining the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$, which are steeper for elements with a large SNIa contribution (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mn) and flatter for elements with low SNIa contribution (e.g., O, Si, Ca). Our analysis does not determine the value of [Mg/Fe] corresponding to pure CCSN enrichment, but it should be at least as high as the upper edge of the plateau at $\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\approx0.35$, and could be significantly higher. Compared to the two-process predictions, the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$ are steeper for (C+N) but shallower for Ce, providing intriguing but contradictory clues about AGB enrichment in the early disk.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Torque Disruption of Dust Grains Induced by Supernova Shock Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feedback from massive stars drives the evolution of interstellar dust grains by altering their physical properties via a number of radiative and mechanical processes. Through these interactions, interstellar grains can achieve high rotational velocities due to unbalanced torques, potentially leading to their disruption. Mechanical torque disruption occurs when gas-grain collisions, induced by the passage of shocks, spin grains to critical rotational velocities. This study aims to investigate the effects of stochastic mechanical torque disruption on both pre-existent and supernova-condensed dust grains located within wind-blown bubbles. The impact of mechanical torque disruption on supernova-condensed dust and dust grains in wind-blown bubbles is investigated through post-processing of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation outputs. The associated timescale is then compared to those of kinetic sputtering and grain shattering. Before the supernova explosion, dust grain disruption timescales within wind-driven bubbles are on the order of millions of years due to the low-density environment. The timescales for mechanical torque disruption (METD) are longer than those for kinetic sputtering and comparable to those of grain shattering, primarily due the high grain drift velocities typical of these regions.</description>

      <title>Dark matter spiral arms in Milky Way-like halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between the dark matter (DM) halo and the stellar disc is a key factor in galactic evolution. While the interaction between structures like the Galactic bar and DM halos has been explored (e.g. slowing down of the bar due to dynamical friction), the effect of spiral arms on the DM halo distribution has received limited attention. We analyze a suite of simulations featuring strong stellar spiral arms, ranging in complexity from test-particle models to fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Using Fourier transforms, we characterize the phase and amplitude of the stellar spirals at different times and radii. We then apply the same methodology to DM particles near the stellar disc and compare trends in Fourier coefficients and phases between the two components. We detect a clear spiral arm signal in the DM distribution, correlated with the stellar spirals, confirming the reaction of the halo. The strength of the DM spirals consistently measures around 10\% of that of the stellar spiral arms. In the $N$-body simulation, the DM spiral persistently trails the stellar spiral arm by approximately $10^\circ$. A strong spiral signal of a few km\,s$^{-1}$ appears in the radial, azimuthal, and vertical velocities of halo particles, distinct from the stellar kinematic signature. In a test-particle simulation with an analytical spiral potential (omitting self-gravity), we reproduce a similar density and kinematic response, showing that the test-particle halo responds in the same way as the $N$-body halo. Finally, we also find the rest of the simulations, indicating that the dynamical signatures of the forced response in the DM halo are independent of the dynamical origin of the stellar spiral arms. We reveal the ubiquitous presence of DM spiral arms in Milky Way-like galaxies, driven by a forced response to the stellar spiral potential. (ABR)</description>

      <title>JWST PRIMER: A deep JWST study of all ALMA-detected galaxies in PRIMER COSMOS -- dust-obscured star-formation history back to z $\simeq$ 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST PRIMER survey to study the properties of (sub)mm sources detected by ALMA in the centre of the COSMOS field, with the aim of better constraining the history of dust-enshrouded star formation. The wealth of ALMA data in this field enabled us to isolate a robust sample of 128 (sub)mm sources within the 175 sq. arcmin of the PRIMER COSMOS survey footprint, spanning two decades in (sub)mm flux density. The JWST imaging is deep/red enough to reveal secure galaxy counterparts for all of these sources. Moreover, 52% of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts, enabling us to refine the photo-zs for the remaining galaxies. Armed with this robust redshift information, we calculate the star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of all 128 ALMA-detected galaxies, and place them in the context of other galaxies in the field. We find that the vast majority of star formation is dust-enshrouded in the ALMA-detected galaxies, with SFR ranging from ~1000 down to ~20 solar masses per year. We also find that virtually all (126/128) have high stellar masses, at all redshifts, with log(M/Msun) &gt; 10. The unusually high quality of our sample enables us to make a robust estimate of the contribution of the ALMA-detected galaxies to cosmic star-formation rate density from z = 2 out to z = 7. Finally, to correct for the fact that the deep ALMA pointings cover &lt; 20% of the PRIMER COSMOS area, we use our knowledge of all other massive galaxies in the field to produce a completeness-corrected estimate of dust-enshrouded star-formation rate density over cosmic time. This confirms that UV-visible star formation dominates at z &gt; 4, but also indicates that dust-enshrouded star formation likely still made a significant contribution at higher redshifts: extrapolation of our results suggest a ~20% contribution at z = 8, and potentially still ~5% at z = 10.</description>

      <title>MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD) -- II. AGN outflows in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is one of the most important mechanisms in galaxy evolution. It is usually found in massive galaxies and regulates star formation. Although dwarf galaxies are assumed to be regulated by supernova feedback, recent studies show evidence for the presence of AGN outflows and feedback in dwarf galaxies. We investigate the presence of AGN outflows in a sample of 2292 dwarf galaxies with AGN signatures drawn from the MaNGA survey. Thanks to the integral field unit data from MaNGA we are able to spatially resolve these outflows and study their kinematics and energetics. Using the GELATO Python code, we fit the AGN-stacked spectrum of each galaxy, which is the stack of all the spaxels classified as AGN by emission line diagnostic diagrams, and in particular the [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA\ emission line. If the galaxies show a broad [OIII] emission line component in the stacked spectrum, we run GELATO through all the spaxels that are classified as AGN in the emission line diagnostic diagrams. We find 11 new dwarf galaxies that present outflow signatures based on the presence of a broad [OIII] emission line component. Their velocity W$_{80}$ (width containing 80$\%$ of the flux of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA\ emission line) ranges from 205 to 566 km s$^{-1}$ and the kinetic energy rate ranges from $\sim10^{35}$ to $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Stellar processes are unlikely to explain these outflow kinetic energy rates in the case of seven dwarf galaxies. We find a correlation between the W$_{80}$ velocity and the [OIII] luminosity and between the kinetic energy rate of the outflow and the bolometric luminosity spanning from massive to dwarf galaxies. This suggests a similar behavior between the AGN outflows in the dwarf galaxy population with those in massive galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the X-ray and radio properties of the galaxy cluster Abell 2009 (z=0.152) to complete the in-depth study of a subsample of objects from the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample with relatively high X-ray flux and H$\alpha$ line luminosity, which is a promising diagnostic of the presence of cool gas in the cluster cores. Our aim is to investigate the feedback from the AGN in the central galaxy and the ICM of relaxed clusters. In this work, we analyze archival data from JVLA and Chandra observations. We performed a morphological analysis of both the X-ray emission from the ICM of Abell 2009 and the radio emission from the AGN in the central galaxy. We also performed a spectral analysis of the X-ray emission to derive the global properties and radial profiles of the thermal gas. Our X-ray analysis confirms the expectations, based on the selection criteria, that Abell 2009 is a cool-core system. We estimate a cooling radius of 88 kpc within which the ICM is radiating its energy at rates of $L_{cool} \sim 4.4 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Radio observations of the central galaxy reveal a bright core surrounded by radio lobes on 30 kpc scales with a symmetric butterfly-shaped morphology. Although we did not detect any X-ray cavity at the position of the central radio lobes, we combined the volume of the lobes with the pressure of the surrounding ICM to derive the work done by the AGN on the gas to inflate them. By estimating a cavity age of about 20 Myr, this corresponds to a mechanical power of $\approx 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ which is sufficient to counterbalance the radiative cooling losses in Abell 2009. We finally discuss possible correlations between the global properties of the 18 objects from the BCS selection, finding in particular that the number of outbursts required to counterbalance the radiative ICM losses is linearly anticorrelated with the energy and power of the outburst.</description>

      <title>An analytical galactic chemical evolution model with gas inflow and a terminal wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analytical galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model with gas inflow, internally caused outflow, and extra gas loss after a period of time. The latter mimics the ram pressure stripping of a dwarf satellite galaxy near the pericenter of its orbit around a host galaxy. The new model is called Inflow with Ram Pressure Stripping (IRPS). We fit the $\alpha$-element ([$\alpha$/H]) distributions of the Draco, Sculptor, Fornax, Leo II, Leo I, and And XVIII dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We compared the best fits of IRPS with four other GCE models. The IRPS fits half of the galaxies in our set better than the Leaky Box, Pre-enriched, Accretion, and Ram Pressure Stripping models. Unlike previous models, none of the IRPS model parameters -- not even the effective yield -- correlates with galaxy properties, like luminosity. One of the IRPS parameters is the $\alpha$-abundance at which stripping began. That parameter can override the effective yield in determining the galaxy's mean $\alpha$-abundance.</description>

      <title>Variation of Dense Gas Mass-Luminosity conversion factor with metallicity in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HCN and HCO$^+$ are the most common dense gas tracers used both in the Milky Way and external galaxies. The luminosity of HCN and HCO$^+$ $J = 1-0$ lines are converted to a dense gas mass by the conversion factor, $\alpha_{Q}$. Traditionally, this $\alpha_{Q}$ has been considered constant throughout the Galaxy and in other galaxies, regardless of the environment. We analyzed 17 outer Galaxy clouds and 5 inner Galaxy clouds with metallicities ranging from 0.38 Z$_{\odot}$ to 1.29 Z$_{\odot}$. Our analysis indicates that $\alpha_{Q}$ is not constant; instead, it varies with metallicity. The metallicity-corrected $\alpha_{Q}$ derived from the HCN luminosity of the entire cloud is almost three times higher in the outer Galaxy than in the inner galaxy. In contrast, HCO$^+$ seems less sensitive to metallicity. We recommend using the metallicity-corrected dense gas conversion factors $\alpha^{'}_{\rm tot, Gas}(\rm HCN) = 19.5^{+5.6}_{-4.4} Z^{(-1.53 \pm 0.59)}$ and $\alpha^{'}_{\rm tot, Gas}(\rm HCO^{+}) = 21.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} Z^{(-1.32\pm0.55)}$ for extragalactic studies. Radiation from nearby stars has an effect on the conversion factor of similar magnitude as that of the metallicity. If we extend the metallicity-corrected scaling relation for HCN to the Central Molecular Zone, the value of $\alpha(\rm HCN)$ becomes $1/3$ to $1/2$ of the local values. This effect could partially account for the low star formation rate per dense gas mass observed in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved Galactic HII regions observed by LAMOST medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Nebulae (LAMOST MRS-N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations of 10 isolated Galactic HII regions using data from the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Nebulae (LAMOST MRS-N). The high spatial resolution of the data allows us to investigate the 1D radial profiles of emission line fluxes (Ha, [S II] and [N II]), flux ratios ([N II]/Ha, [S II]/Ha and [S II]/[N II]), and radial velocities of these three emission lines. Among these regions, two are ionization-bounded, while the remaining eight are matter-bounded. The matter-bounded HII regions exhibit shallower slopes in their radial flux profiles compared to the ionization-bounded ones. In most cases, the [N II]/Ha and [S II]/Ha ratios increase with distance from the center of the HII regions, consistent with model predictions that low-ionization emissions dominate the outer zones of these regions. The two ionization-bounded HII regions have kinematic ages (t) of 0.2 and 0.3 Myr, while the matter-bounded regions span ages from 1 to 12 Myr. For the matter-bounded HII regions, the optical emission flux decreases continuously beyond the photodissociation region (PDR), extending to approximately 1-4 times the radius of the PDR (r_PDR). The escape fraction f_esc of ionizing photons, derived from 1D Ha radial flux profiles, is ~ 0% for ionization-bounded HII regions, while it ranges from 50% to 90% for the matter-bounded HII regions. The correlation between f_esc and t suggests that evolved HII regions (with t &gt; 1 Myr) contribute more significantly to ionizing the surrounding diffuse ionized gas compared to younger, newly formed HII regions.</description>

      <title>Warm Gas in the Vicinity of a Supermassive Black hole 13 Billion Years Ago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars, powered by supermassive black holes (SMBH), are among the brightest objects in the universe. In the vicinity of an SMBH, X-ray photons from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can heat the surrounding gas to several hundred kelvin. Here we report observations of dust continuum and CO J=13-12 and J=14-13 line emissions at a resolution of 130 parsecs in a luminous quasar at z=6. We successfully detected these high-J CO line emissions from warm gas in a compact disk component. The CO luminosity ratio in the central region of the compact disk is consistent with theoretical models in which X-ray heating dominates the CO excitation and the gas column density is as high as 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. This demonstrates that high-resolution observations of high-J CO lines are promising ways to identify extremely dust-obscured quasars in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The AGEL Survey Data Release 2: A Gravitational Lens Sample for Galaxy Evolution and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) Survey is an ongoing effort to spectroscopically confirm a diverse sample of gravitational lenses with high spatial resolution imaging, to facilitate a broad range of science outcomes. The AGEL systems span single galaxy-scale deflectors to groups and clusters, and include rare targets such as galaxy-scale lenses with multiple sources, lensed quiescent galaxies, and Einstein rings. We build on the 77 systems presented in Tran et al. 2022 (AGEL data release 1) to present a total 138 lenses, and high resolution F140W and F200LP Hubble Space Telescope images for 71 lenses from a completed HST SNAP program. Lens candidates were originally identified by convolutional neural networks in the DES and DECaLS imaging fields, and of the targets with follow-up spectroscopy we find a high (96%) success rate. Compared with other spectroscopic lens samples, AGEL lenses tend to have both higher redshift deflectors and sources. We briefly discuss the common causes of false-positive candidates, and strategies for mitigating false-positives in next generation lens searches. Lastly, we present 6 galaxy-scale double-source plane lenses useful for cosmological analyses. With next-generation telescopes and surveys such as Euclid, Vera Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, Keck Observatory's KAPA program, and 4MOST's 4SLSLS surveys on the horizon, the AGEL survey represents a pathfinder for refining automated candidate search methods and identifying and triaging candidates for followup based on scientific potential.</description>

      <title>Identification of Star Clusters in M31 from PAndAS Images Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of star clusters holds significant importance in studying galaxy formation and evolution history. However, the task of swiftly and accurately identifying star clusters from vast amounts of photometric images presents an immense challenge. To address these difficulties, we employ deep learning models for image classification to identify young disk star clusters in M31 from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) images. For training, validation, and testing, we utilize the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey catalogs. We evaluate the performance of various deep learning models, using different classification thresholds and limiting magnitudes. Our findings indicate that the ResNet-50 model exhibits the highest overall accuracy. Moreover, using brighter limiting magnitudes and increasing the classification thresholds can effectively enhance the accuracy and precision of cluster identification. Through our experiments, we found that the model achieves optimal performance when the limiting magnitude is set to brighter than 21 mag. Based on this, we constructed a training dataset with magnitudes less than 21 mag and trained a second ResNet-50 model. This model achieved a purity of 89.30%, a recall of 73.55%, and an F1 score of 80.66% when the classification threshold was set to 0.669. Applying the second model to all sources in the PAndAS fields within a projected radius of 30 kpc from the center of M31, we identified 2,228 new unique star cluster candidates. We conducted visual inspections to validate the results produced by our automated methods, and we ultimately obtained 1,057 star cluster candidates, of which 745 are newly identified.</description>

Abstract: Machine-learning is playing an increasing role in helping the astronomical community to face data analysis challenges, in particular in the field of Galactic Archaeology and large scale spectroscopic surveys. We present recent developments in the field of convolutional neural-networks (CNNs) for stellar abundances in the context of the Galactic spectroscopic surveys Gaia-ESO, and Gaia-RVS. Especially, by combining the full Gaia data product, we manage to characterize for the first time the [alpha/M] vs. [M/H] bimodality in the Galactic disc with Gaia-RVS spectra at low-S/N. This work is highly relevant for the next generation of large scale surveys such as MSE, 4MOST, and WST.</description>

      <title>Cloud populations versus galactic environment in NGC4689, NGC628, NGC1566, and NGC4321</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of molecular clouds in galaxies beyond the Local Group is limited by the need to efficiently sample diverse galactic environments across galactic discs, typically resulting in a loss of resolution. Using a high-resolution dust extinction technique, we image the dust (and gas) of 4 nearby galaxies (&lt;18 Mpc; NGC 4689, NGC 628, NGC 1566, and NGC 4321) with resolutions between 5-9 pc. We present catalogues of spatially-resolved clouds for these galaxies, with which we investigate whether different galactic environments and morphologies have a significant impact on observed cloud properties. We find no systematic differences in cloud size, aspect ratio, or morphology with galactic environment or radius. We do find changes in cloud masses/surface densities between the centres and discs of galaxies, with clouds in centres typically displaying higher values of mass/surface density. Furthermore, we find distinct distributions of cloud surface densities across the bars of NGC 1566 and NGC 4321. Differences between the arm and inter-arm populations are more subtle, with some galaxies in the sample having much higher cloud masses/surface densities in their spiral arms, and other galaxies showing fairly similar arm/inter-arm distributions. These results suggest that, even within this small sample of galaxies, not all spiral arms and bars seem to behave and affect the interstellar medium equally. Therefore, performing a qualitative environment analysis, where clouds of different galaxies are all binned together under the same visual environmental classification, leads to the loss of information on interesting property variations which in turn demonstrate the impact of the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>The detection of strongly-lensed submillimetre galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present predictions of the number and properties of strongly-lensed submillimetre galaxies, based on an adaption of the physically-motivated LensPop model covering galaxy-galaxy strong lensing by elliptical galaxies, which successfully predicted optical and near-infrared lenses. For submillimetre-luminous lensed galaxies, the most efficient observational selection identifies sources with high fluxes (S500um &gt; 80 mJy), where lensed sources outnumber bright unlensed sources; several hundred candidates from Herschel surveys have been identified, and confirmed by follow-up observations. We have tested our model against these observations. The model predicts an all-sky number density of 0.09+/-0.05 deg-2 (in absolute numbers, 3,600+/-1,800) of bright lensed galaxies detectable by this method. Observations show considerable variation in sky density between fields, 0.08 - 0.31 deg-2. Predictions of redshift and magnification distributions are comparable to observations, although the model appears to under-predict lenses at the highest magnifications ( &gt; 20). We predict that the apparent AB magnitudes at visible wavelengths of the foreground lenses will be as faint as 28, whereas observations typically reach ~ 23, implying that some apparently unlensed bright submillimetre galaxies may have lensing galaxies below this detection limit. For fainter lensed galaxies, the model predicts over 130,000 systems with flux S500um &gt; 10 mJy across the sky, of which ~ 3,400 remain be be discovered in the Herschel catalogues. We also predict that Euclid should be able to detect some 25,000 lensed submillimetre galaxies that are VIS-band 'dropouts' - detectable in the near-infrared but not at optical wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical properties of star clusters projected toward tidally perturbed SMC regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the astrophysical properties of a sample of star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). They have been selected with the aim of looking for the connection between their ages, heliocentric distances and metallicities with the existence of tidally perturbed/induced outermost SMC regions. We derived the star cluster fundamental parameters from relatively deep Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) DR2 color magnitude diagrams, cleaned from field star contamination, and compared to thousand synthetic CMDs covering a wide range of heliocentric distances, ages and metal content. Heliocentric distances for 15 star clusters are derived for the first time, which represents an increase of 50 per cent of SMC clusters with estimated heliocentric distances. The analysis of the age-metallicity relationships (AMRs) of cluster located in outermost regions distributed around the SMC and in the SMC Main Body reveals that they have followed the overall galaxy chemical enrichment history. However, since half of the studied clusters are placed in front of or behind the SMC Main Body, we concluded that they formed in the SMC and have traveled outward because of the tidal effects from the interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Furthermore, metal rich clusters formed recently in some of these outermost regions from gas that was also dragged by tidal effects from the inner SMC. This outcome leads to consider the SMC as a galaxy scarred by the LMC tidal interaction with distance-perturbed and newly induced outermost stellar substructures.</description>

      <title>Gas Perturbations in Hot Smooth Atmospheres X-ray Surface Brightness Fluctuations in Smooth Galaxy Cluster Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure surface brightness fluctuations in Chandra X-ray images of the cores of the galaxy clusters Abell 2029, Abell 2151, Abell 2107, RBS0533, and RBS0540. Their relatively structureless X-ray atmospheres exhibit the thermodynamic properties of cool cores including short central cooling times and low entropy. However, unlike typical cool-core clusters, molecular gas, star formation, and bubbles associated with radio jets are faint or absent near their central galaxies. Four clusters show typical gas density fluctuation amplitudes of $\sim$ 10 per cent on the scales probed, apart from RBS0540, which exhibits lower amplitudes, suggesting that its gas is mildly disturbed. Under the assumption that gas density fluctuations are indicative of random gas velocities, we estimate scale-dependent velocity amplitudes of gas motions across all studied clusters, which range from 100 km/s to 200 km/s in Abell 2029, Abell 2151, and Abell 2107. These velocity estimates are comparable to the atmospheric velocity dispersion in the Perseus cluster measured by the Hitomi X-ray Observatory. The turbulent heating rates implied by our measurements are of the same order as the radiative cooling rates. Our results suggest that atmospheric sloshing and perhaps turbulent motion may aid radio jets in stabilizing atmospheric cooling.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectroscopic View of a Rapidly Growing Dust-obscured Quasar at $z \sim 4$: Effect of Dust Extinction Correction on Black Hole Mass and Eddington Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the merger-driven galaxy evolution scenario, the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dust obscured galaxies grow rapidly. Interestingly, a recent work \citep{suh24} on a dust-obscured galaxy, LID-568 at $z=3.965$, has shown that its SMBH is growing extremely fast at about 40 times of the Eddington-limited accretion rate (i.e., super-Eddington accretion). However, the heavy dust extinction of the host galaxy could affect the result if not corrected properly. Here, we analyze James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI spectra of LID-568. By measuring its bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) and BH mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) using an extinction-free estimator based on mid-infrared spectra, we obtain $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.83\pm0.07}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ and $M_{\rm BH} = 10^{8.43\pm0.15}\,M_{\odot}$. The measured Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) is 1.97$\pm$0.88, consistent with the accretion rate at the Eddington limit; in other words, not in super-Eddington in a significant manner. This result underscores challenges and the importance of carefully considering dust extinction when analyzing the BH growth in dust-obscured quasars.</description>

      <title>Do JWST reionization (optical depth) puzzle, cosmological tensions, and CMB anomalies imply Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed massive galaxies at high redshifts, which implies an earlier epoch of reionization (EoR) compared with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) results. In this paper, based on \texttt{Planck 2020} (NPIPE release), \texttt{ACT DR4} and \texttt{SPT-3G} data, if assumed a Harrison-Zel'dovich (HZ) primordial power spectrum in the standard cosmological model, we discover that the redshift or optical depth of reionization is larger than the case of a power-law (PL) primordial power spectrum. In HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM model, the redshift of reionization is $ z_\text{reio} = 9.11 \pm 0.61 $, which is consistent with the JWST result that $ z_\text{reio} \approx 8.9 $. Moreover, the cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble ($H_0$) tension and $ S_8 $ tension are alleviated in HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM case. The Hubble constant is $ H_0 = 70.38 \pm 0.35 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$ and the structure growth parameter is $ S_8 = 0.7645\pm 0.0094 $ in HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM model. We also consider two extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM, including $ \Lambda $CDM$ + A_\text{L} $ and $ \Lambda $CDM$ + \Omega_\text{k} $ models. But the extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM with a HZ spectrum meet more serious CMB anomalies, i.e. lensing anomaly and spatial curvature anomaly as compared with the extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM with a PL spectrum. We discuss that these two CMB anomalies may come from the degeneracy of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Faster than SAM: An empirical model for the tidal evolution of dark matter substructure around strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses enable direct inference of halo abundance and internal structure, which in turn enable constraints on the nature of dark matter and the primordial matter power spectrum. However, the density profiles of dark subhalos around the main deflector of a strong lens system also depend on tidal evolution inside the host, complicating the interpretation of strong-lensing inferences. We present a model for subhalo tidal evolution that accurately predicts the bound mass function and the density profiles of tidally-stripped subhalos that appear near the Einstein radius of a typical deflector for a variety of dark matter models. This model matches predictions from the semi-analytic model (SAM) {\tt{galacticus}}, but enables the simulation of subhalo populations in seconds, rather than hours. We use this model to examine the expected number of subhalos near the Einstein radius of a typical lens, and examine their lensing signals. We show that in cold dark matter the amplitude of the bound mass function is suppressed by a factor of $20$ relative to the infall mass function, and $87 \%$ of subhalos appearing in projection near the Einstein radius of a typical strong lensing deflector have lost more than $80\%$ of their mass since infall. Tidal stripping becomes increasingly severe in dark matter models with suppressed small-scale power, such as warm dark matter. This model will be used to forward model subhalo populations in forthcoming analyses of strong lens systems.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVI: Lens search in HSC-PDR3 with a neural network committee and post-processing for false-positive removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have carried out a systematic search for galaxy-scale lenses exploiting multi-band imaging data from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the focus on false-positive removal, after applying deep learning classifiers to all 110 million sources with i-Kron radius above 0.8". To improve the performance, we tested the combination of multiple networks from our previous lens search projects and found the best performance by averaging the scores from five of our networks. Although this ensemble network leads already to a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.01% at a true-positive rate (TPR) of 75% on known real lenses, we have elaborated techniques to further clean the network candidate list before visual inspection. In detail, we tested the rejection using SExtractor and the modeling network from HOLISMOKES IX, which resulted together in a candidate rejection of 29% without lowering the TPR. We carried out a comprehensive multi-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95 grade A (average grade G &gt;2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 &gt;G &gt;1.5) lens candidates, including 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also incorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of photometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model predictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected candidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which makes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results demonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the selection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling networks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network candidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main limitation in lens search to date.</description>

      <title>L1448 IRS3B: Dust Polarization Aligned with Spiral Features, Tracing Gas Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumstellar disk dust polarization in the (sub)millimeter is, for the most part, not from dust grain alignment with magnetic fields but rather indicative of a combination of dust self-scattering with a yet unknown alignment mechanism that is consistent with mechanical alignment. While the observational evidence for scattering has been well established, that for mechanical alignment is less so. Circum-multiple dust structures in protostellar systems provide a unique environment to probe different polarization alignment mechanisms. We present ALMA Band 4 and Band 7 polarization observations toward the multiple young system L1448 IRS3B. The polarization in the two Bands is consistent with each other, presenting multiple polarization morphologies. On the size scale of the inner envelope surrounding the circum-multiple disk, the polarization is consistent with magnetic field dust grain alignment. On the very small scale of compact circumstellar regions, we see polarization that is consistent with scattering around source a and c, which are likely the most optically thick components. Finally, we see polarization that is consistent with mechanical alignment of dust grains along the spiral dust structures, which would suggest that the dust is tracing the relative gas flow along the spiral arms. If the gas-flow dust grain alignment mechanism is dominant in these cases, disk dust polarization may provide a direct probe of the small-scale kinematics of the gas flow relative to the dust grains.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2011-BLG-0462: An Isolated Stellar-Mass Black Hole Confirmed Using New HST Astrometry and Updated Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-duration Galactic-bulge microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 produced relativistic astrometric deflections of the source star, which we measured using HST observations taken at 8 epochs over ~6 years. Analysis of the microlensing light curve and astrometry led our group (followed by other independent groups) to conclude that the lens is an isolated stellar-mass black hole (BH)--the first and only one unambiguously discovered to date. There have now been three additional epochs of HST observations, increasing the astrometric time baseline to 11 years. Additionally, the ground-based OGLE data have been updated. We have re-analyzed the data, including the new HST astrometry, and photometry obtained with 16 different telescopes. The source lies only 0.4 arcsec from a bright neighbor, making it crucial to perform precise subtraction of its point-spread function (PSF) in the astrometric measurements of the source. Moreover, we show that it is essential to perform a separate PSF subtraction for each individual HST frame as part of the reductions. Our final solution yields a lens mass of 7.15 +/- 0.83 solar mass. Combined with the lack of detected light from the lens at late HST epochs, the BH nature of the lens is conclusively verified. The BH lies at a distance of 1.52 +/- 0.15 kpc, and is moving with a space velocity of 51.1 +/- 7.5 km/s relative to the stars in the neighborhood. We compare our results with those of other studies and discuss reasons for the differences. We searched for binary companions of the BH at a range of separations but found no evidence for any.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hubble constant using standard sirens and reconstructed matter density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarise a new approach for measuring the Hubble constant using standard sirens and the reconstructed matter density field obtained from observed galaxy surveys. Specifically, we describe and test this method using the Bayesian forward-modelled software BORG. This software evolves the initial density field to the present, sampling plausible density fields from the posterior, accounting for peculiar velocities, and automatically incorporating higher-order correlation functions. The advantage of adding additional information from correlations is expected to make this method more effective in low-signal-to-noise regimes, such as those with modest galaxy number density or incomplete surveys. Our results show that developing a cross-correlation framework between gravitational waves and galaxy surveys, based on the forward-modelled reconstructed density field, to measure H0 is promising. This review is based on the research conducted as part of Boruah's Ph.D. thesis.</description>

      <title>A census of OB stars within 1 kpc and the star formation and core collapse supernova rates of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OB stars are crucial for our understanding of Galactic structure, star formation, stellar feedback and multiplicity. In this paper we have compiled a census of all OB stars within 1 kpc of the Sun. We performed evolutionary and atmospheric model fits to observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) compiled from astro-photometric survey data. We have characterized and mapped 24,706 O- and B-type stars ($T_{\rm eff} &gt; 10,000$ K) within 1 kpc of the Sun, whose overdensities correspond to well-studied OB associations and massive star-forming regions such as Sco-Cen, Orion OB1, Vela OB2, Cepheus and Circinus. We have assessed the quality of our catalogue by comparing it with spectroscopic samples and similar catalogues of OB(A) stars, as well as catalogues of OB associations, star-forming regions and young open clusters. Finally, we have also exploited our list of OB stars to estimate their scale height (76 $\pm$ 1 pc), a local star formation rate of $2896^{+417}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ and a local core-collapse supernova rate of $\sim$15--30 per Myr. We extrapolate these rates to the entire Milky Way to derive a Galactic SFR of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a core-collapse supernova rate of 0.4--0.5 per century. These are slightly lower than previous estimates, which we attribute to improvements in our census of OB stars and changes to evolutionary models. We calculate a near-Earth core collapse supernova rate of $\sim$2.5 per Gyr that supports the view that nearby supernova explosions could have caused one or more of the recorded mass extinction events on Earth.</description>

      <title>Utilizing localized fast radio bursts to constrain their progenitors and the expansion history of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are increasingly being used for cosmological applications such as measuring the Hubble constant and baryon abundance. The increasing number of localized FRBs and precise measurement of dispersion measure (DM) make them a suitable probe for such an approach. We use a sample of 110 localized FRBs as well as a small sub-sample of 24 FRBs with scattering timescale measurements or limits. We infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the DM distribution of the host galaxies simultaneously by fitting our model to the FRB DM measurements. With current data, our results are in agreement with both high and low redshift measurements of $H_0$, obtained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae data respectively. We project that with about 200 localized FRBs, we would be in a position to distinguish between the two scenarios at 4$\sigma$ confidence. In addition, the host DM is expected to be related to star formation in the host galaxy and the stellar age of the progenitors. Using our inferred host galaxy DMs, we are able to rule out (at 95 percent confidence) a majority of localized FRB progenitors originating from young sources with stellar ages less than 10 Myr. This might reflect a large population of old sources or an observational bias against detecting FRBs from young sources, which may be associated with long scatter broadening times and large DM from their source environments. Indeed, we find that scatter broadening times of FRBs are inconsistent with the Milky Way ISM, but at the same time, do not appear to be strongly correlated with the FRBs' redshift or with the SFR or stellar mass of their host galaxies. This suggests that scattering is dominated by the immediate environment of the sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-infrared spectra from the IRTF/SpeX and Blanco/ARCoIRIS telescope/instrument combinations are used for spectroscopic classification, to measure radial velocities and for the inference of astrophysical properties of 51 Gaia-selected nearby ultracool dwarfs. In this sample, 44 are newly classified in the near infrared. All but one of the UCDs are within 100 pc, and 37 lie within 50 pc. We find a total of 26 M-types, 24 L-types and one T-type in our sample. The positions of the majority of the UCDs on colour-magnitude diagrams and with evolutionary cooling track plots indicate that they are largely old and stellar in nature. There are a few UCDs of particular interest which lie away from expected trends, highlighting potential young, binary and thick disc/subdwarf UCDs. From spectral and kinematic analyses, we identify UCDs of particular interest for further investigation, including seven potentially young UCDs, three thick disc UCDs, one subdwarf, six wide binaries, and six unresolved binaries.</description>

      <title>Extreme Jet Beaming Observed in Neutrino-Associated Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them over recent years. A particularly strong observational connection is present between neutrinos and blazars with bright, Doppler-boosted, parsec-scale radio emission. In this work, we further explore the nature of this connection by examining the jet geometry and kinematics of neutrino-associated blazars. We find that these blazars demonstrate remarkably strong jet beaming, even compared to other radio-bright sources. Their Doppler and Lorentz factors are larger, and viewing angles are smaller than for other blazars in the complete uniformly selected MOJAVE sample. Observationally, this serves as yet another piece of evidence for blazars forming a major population of neutrino sources. The strong neutrino-beaming correlation indicates that high-energy neutrino velocity is predominantly oriented along the jet, and the original PeV-scale protons exhibit a relativistic bulk motion along the jet. It suggests that neutrino production happens not too close to the black hole, but rather at sub-parsec distances, where the jet is already accelerated.</description>

      <title>From Young Massive Clusters to Old Globular Clusters: Density Profile Evolution and IMBH Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface brightness profiles of globular clusters are conventionally described with the well-known King profile. However, observations of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe suggest that they are better fit by simple models with flat central cores and simple power-law densities in their outer regions (such as the Elson-Fall-Freeman, or EFF, profile). Depending on their initial central density, YMCs may also facilitate large numbers of stellar collisions, potentially creating very massive stars that will directly collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Using Monte Carlo $N$-body models of YMCs, we show that EFF-profile clusters transform to Wilson or King profiles through natural dynamical evolution, but that their final $W_0$ parameters do not strongly correlate to their initial concentrations. In the densest YMCs, runaway stellar mergers can produce stars that collapse into IMBHs, with their final masses depending on the treatment of the giant star envelopes during collisions. If a common-envelope prescription is assumed, where the envelope is partially or entirely lost, stars form with masses up to $824\,M_{\odot}$, collapsing into IMBHs of $232\,M_{\odot}$. Alternatively, if no mass loss is assumed, stars as massive as $4000\,M_{\odot}$ can form, collapsing into IMBHs of $\sim 4000\,M_{\odot}$. In doing so, these runaway collisions also deplete the clusters of their primordial massive stars, reducing the number of stellar-mass BHs by as much as $\sim$ 40%. This depletion will accelerate the core collapse, suggesting that the process of IMBH formation itself may produce the high densities observed in some core-collapsed clusters.</description>

      <title>Investigating C-D out-of-plane vibrational modes in PAHs as a tool to study interstellar deuterium-containing PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.</description>

      <title>Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics IV: Non Rotating Galaxies</title>

Abstract: At it stands, the $\Lambda CDM$ model does not anticipate the early emergence of massive galaxies. Canonical Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) seems to fail at late time solar system scale and Wide-Binary scales. To match data, a MOND variant needs a variable MOND acceleration $a_0$ which is strong at high redshift galactic scale and diminishes over redshift to far below Newtonian gravity at solar system scale at late time. We found such a candidate in a relativistic frame-work. In a previous work, a new single-metric solution of Einstein Gravity is found for a point mass residing in an expanding universe, which apart from the Newtonian acceleration, gives rise to an additional MOND-like acceleration in which the MOND acceleration $a_0$ is replaced by the cosmological acceleration $\frac{1}{2}H^2(z)r$. This cosmological acceleration is shown to be far below Newtonian acceleration in the solar system. In this work, we study the monolithic evolution of a Milky Way mass protogalactic cloud at recombination in this model where the non-Newtonian acceleration is stronger than Newtonian gravity. To obtain a spherical galaxy we assume that a point on a mass shell at turnaround will pick up non-systematic angular momentum. Assuming a violent relaxation process similar to the simulation studies for MOND and Newtonian gravity, we find that the central core can form a time independent Quasi-Stationary-State (QSS) by z&gt;7, which could explain the galaxy morphology stability observations for $z&lt;6.5$. The virialised potential has a Newtonian acceleration dominant central region and a MOND-like acceleration dominant outer region. We evaluate the corresponding MOND acceleration $a_0^{VM}$ in a virialised potential for a Milky-Way mass elliptical galaxy and find that $a_0^{VM}\sim a_0$.</description>

      <title>The GALAH Survey: Data Release 4</title>

Abstract: The stars of the Milky Way carry the chemical history of our Galaxy in their atmospheres as they journey through its vast expanse. Like barcodes, we can extract the chemical fingerprints of stars from high-resolution spectroscopy. The fourth data release (DR4) of the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey, based on a decade of observations, provides the chemical abundances of up to 32 elements for 917 588 stars that also have exquisite astrometric data from the $Gaia$ satellite. For the first time, these elements include life-essential nitrogen to complement carbon, and oxygen as well as more measurements of rare-earth elements critical to modern-life electronics, offering unparalleled insights into the chemical composition of the Milky Way.
  For this release, we use neural networks to simultaneously fit stellar parameters and abundances across the whole wavelength range, leveraging synthetic grids computed with Spectroscopy Made Easy. These grids account for atomic line formation in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium for 14 elements. In a two-iteration process, we first fit stellar labels to all 1 085 520 spectra, then co-add repeated observations and refine these labels using astrometric data from $Gaia$ and 2MASS photometry, improving the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters and abundances. Our validation thoroughly assesses the reliability of spectroscopic measurements and highlights key caveats.
  GALAH DR4 represents yet another milestone in Galactic archaeology, combining detailed chemical compositions from multiple nucleosynthetic channels with kinematic information and age estimates. The resulting dataset, covering nearly a million stars, opens new avenues for understanding not only the chemical and dynamical history of the Milky Way, but also the broader questions of the origin of elements and the evolution of planets, stars, and galaxies.</description>

      <title>The AstroSat UV Deep Field South II: A diverse set of Lyman-continuum leakers at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of 5 newly identifed Lyman-continuum (LyC) leaker candidates at redshifts 0.99-1.42 in the AstroSat UV Deep Field South F154W image. We derive physical properties of these galaxies using a combination of spectral-energy distribution fitting and information from publicly available spectra. The estimated escape fraction of these objects vary from 14-85\% after accounting for the IGM attenuation. With only about a dozen known leakers at these redshifts, these detections significantly raise the fraction of LyC leakers in this redshift range. High-resolution HST UV imaging reveals that a subset of the galaxies in our sample have blue star-forming structures that are likely associated with harder ionizing sources. We find tentative evidence that the LyC emission is spatially offset from the non-ionizing UV continuum centers of these galaxies. The integrated properties of these galaxies, such as the UV continuum slope, dust attenuation, stellar mass, and $[\text{O III}] \lambda 5007/ [\text{O II}] \lambda 3727$ ratios, make them atypical compared to known LyC leakers. The leakage of LyC photons from these systems presents a compelling challenge.</description>

      <title>Orbits and vertical height distribution of 4006 open clusters in the Galactic disk using Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) in the Galaxy are excellent probes for tracing the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk. We present an updated catalog of parameters for 1,145 OCs, estimated using the Gaia DR3 data earlier listed in Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020). This sample is complemented by 3,677 OCs from the catalog by Hunt &amp; Reffert (2023). Using the Galaxy potential and the space velocities, orbits of 4,006 OCs were computed. We provide a catalog with orbital parameters such as eccentricity, perigalactic and apogalactic distance, and the maximum vertical height traced by OCs from the Galactic disk. The OCs were found to be distributed between 5-16 kpc from the Galactic center, with older OCs showing a radially extended distribution. The low number of old OCs in the inner Solar circle region likely suggests their destruction in this area. We derive a quantitative expression for the dependency of the maximum vertical height (Z_max) OCs can reach with the cluster's age and Galactocentric radius for the first time. The young and intermediate-age OCs show similar values of Z_max till 9 kpc, with the latter group having higher values beyond. OCs older than 1 Gyr show larger values of Z_max at all Galactocentric radii and significantly larger values beyond 9 kpc. Higher values of Z_max are found in the third Galactic quadrant, suggesting a link between these higher values and the Galactic warp. This sample shows that young OCs are also involved in the diagonal ridge formation in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on the Mass of Cool Gas in the Circumgalactic Medium of Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use HI absorption measurements to constrain the amount of cool ($\approx 10^4$ K), photoionized gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of dwarf galaxies with $M_* = 10^{6.5-9.5}~M_\odot$ in the nearby Universe ($z&lt;0.3$). We show analytically that volume-filling gas gives an upper limit on the gas mass needed to reproduce a given HI column density profile. We introduce a power-law density profile for the gas distribution and fit our model to archival HI observations to infer the cool CGM gas mass, $M_{\rm cCGM}$, as a function of halo mass. For volume-filling ($f_V=1$) models, we find $M_{\rm cCGM} = 5 \times 10^8-2 \times 10^9~M_{\odot}$, constituting $\lesssim 10\%$ of the halo baryon budget. For clumpy gas, with $f_V=0.01$, the masses are a factor of $\approx 11$ lower, in agreement with our analytic approximation. Our assumption that the measured HI forms entirely in the cool CGM provides a conservative upper limit on $M_{\rm cCGM}$, and possible contributions from the intergalactic medium or warm/hot CGM will further strengthen our result. We estimate the mass uncertainties due to the range of redshifts in our sample and the unknown gas metallicity to be $\approx 15\%$ and $\approx 10\%$, respectively. Our results show that dwarf galaxies have only $\lesssim 15\%$ of their baryon budget in stars and the cool CGM, with the rest residing in the warm/hot CGM or ejected from the dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole stellar microlensing constraints: understanding their dependence on the density and velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microlensing surveys of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud constrain the fraction of the Milky Way halo in Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with mass $10^{-9} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$. Various studies have reached different conclusions on the uncertainties in these constraints due to uncertainties in the Dark Matter (DM) distribution. We therefore revisit the dependence of the microlensing differential event rate, and hence exclusion limits, on the DM density and velocity distributions. The constraints on the abundance of low- and high-mass PBHs depend, respectively, on the long- and short-duration tails of the differential event rate distribution. Long-duration events are due to PBHs moving close to the line of sight and their rate (and hence the constraints on low-mass PBHs) has a fairly weak ($\sim 10\%$) dependence on the DM density and velocity distributions. Short-duration events are due to PBHs close to the observer and their rate (and hence the constraints on moderate- and high-mass PBHs) depends much more strongly on the DM velocity distribution. An accurate calculation of the local DM velocity distribution is therefore crucial for accurately calculating PBH stellar microlensing constraints.</description>

      <title>Census of Ly$\alpha$ Emission from $\sim 600$ Galaxies at $z=5-14$: Evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ Luminosity Function and a Late Sharp Cosmic Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the statistical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emission in 586 galaxies at $z=4.5-14.2$, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions from $z\sim 5$ to $z\sim 10-14$ with the observed Ly$\alpha$ EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a $\sim3$ dex decrease in number density at $L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}=10^{42}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the redshift range. Notably, this study presents the first constraints on the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function at $z\sim 8-14$. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.17_{-0.16}^{+0.23}$, $0.63_{-0.28}^{+0.18}$, $0.79_{-0.21}^{+0.13}$, and $0.88_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ at $z\sim6$, $7$, $8-9$, and $10-14$, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly$\alpha$, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high $x_\mathrm{HI}$ values over $z\sim 7-14$ suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at $z\sim 6-7$. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at $z\sim 6-7$.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Burst, quench, repeat -- unveiling the evolution of high-redshift galaxies along the star-forming main sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the evolution of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) at high redshift is crucial to contextualize the observed extreme properties of galaxies in the early Universe. We present an analysis of the SFMS and its scatter in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations, where we find a redshift evolution of the SFMS normalization scaling as $\propto (1+z)^{2.64\pm0.03}$, significantly stronger than is typically inferred from observations. We can reproduce the flatter observed evolution by filtering out weakly star-forming galaxies, implying that current observational fits are biased due to a missing population of lulling galaxies or overestimated star-formation rates. We also explore star-formation variability using the scatter of galaxies around the SFMS ($\sigma_{\mathrm{MS}}$). At the population level, the scatter around the SFMS increases with cosmic time, driven by the increased importance of long-term environmental effects in regulating star formation at later times. To study short-term star-formation variability, or ''burstiness'', we isolate the scatter on timescales shorter than 50 Myr. The short-term scatter is larger at higher redshift, indicating that star formation is indeed more bursty in the early Universe. We identify two starburst modes: (i) externally driven, where rapid large-scale inflows trigger and fuel prolonged, extreme star formation episodes, and (ii) internally driven, where cyclical ejection and re-accretion of the interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies drive bursts, even under relatively steady large-scale inflow. Both modes occur at all redshifts, but the increased burstiness of galaxies at higher redshift is due to the increasing prevalence of the more extreme external mode of star formation.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: central starbursts and inside-out quenching govern galaxy sizes in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of galaxy sizes at high redshift ($3 &lt; z &lt; 13$) using the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on the mass range of $10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; \mathrm{M}_{\ast} &lt; 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is tightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main sequence experience rapid central compaction during starbursts, followed by inside-out quenching and spatially extended star formation that leads to expansion, causing oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably, we find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent with observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute this discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase interstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective equation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also find that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power law as a function of redshift, with a break at $z\approx6$, because the majority of galaxies at $z &gt; 6$ show rising star-formation histories, and therefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H$\alpha$ emission is systematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7, consistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous interpretations that link extended H$\alpha$ sizes to inside-out growth, we find that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from H$\alpha$. Instead, a simple Str\"{o}mgren sphere argument reproduces observed trends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the primary driver of extended nebular emission.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE): Mission Design and Science Goals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is an Explorer-class mission concept to measure the energy spectrum and linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A single cryogenic Fourier transform spectrometer compares the sky to an external blackbody calibration target, measuring the Stokes I, Q, U parameters to levels ~200 Jy/sr in each 2.65 degree diameter beam over the full sky, in each of 300 frequency channels from 28 GHz to 6 THz. With sensitivity over 1000 times greater than COBE/FIRAS, PIXIE opens a broad discovery space for the origin, contents, and evolution of the universe. Measurements of small distortions from a CMB blackbody spectrum provide a robust determination of the mean electron pressure and temperature in the universe while constraining processes including dissipation of primordial density perturbations, black holes, and the decay or annihilation of dark matter. Full-sky maps of linear polarization measure the optical depth to reionization at nearly the cosmic variance limit and constrain models of primordial inflation. Spectra with sub-percent absolute calibration spanning microwave to far-IR wavelengths provide a legacy data set for analyses including line intensity mapping of extragalactic emission and the cosmic infrared background amplitude and anisotropy. We describe the PIXIE instrument sensitivity, foreground subtraction, and anticipated science return from both the baseline 2-year mission and a potential extended mission.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the world's leading instrument for high-resolution imaging of the 0.3 to 10 mm wavelength sky. This interferometer exemplifies successful international collaboration even down to its individual components, including its telescope dishes and receivers produced in global partnerships. Over the past roughly ten years of ALMA operation, these receivers have been responsible for nearly ten thousand publications, as carefully monitored by the online ALMA Science Archive. However, the citations of the relevant receiver papers have not managed to grow together with their use in the astronomical community, which points out an information gap among the astronomical community. To overcome this gap, this memo provides a comprehensive list of receiver references, which was created in direct contact with the receiver groups.</description>

Abstract: Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of transient that can offer tight cosmological constraints that are complementary to methods from other astronomical events. We present a follow-up study of one recently-discovered strongly lensed SN, the quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, "SN Zwicky") at z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky and derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because SNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness. Specifically, we measure point spread function (PSF) photometry for all four images of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W, F625W, F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken $\sim 11$ months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find consistency to within $2\sigma$ between lens model predicted time delays ($\lesssim1$ day), and measured time delays with HST colors ($\lesssim2$ days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars in the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to estimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being elevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about $6\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively, confirming previous work. We show that millilensing or differential dust extinction is unable to explain these discrepancies and find evidence for the existence of microlensing in images A, C, and potentially D, that may contribute to the anomalous magnification.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning generated observations of galaxy clusters from dark-matter-only simulations</title>

Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations play a fundamental role in modern cosmological research, serving as a crucial bridge between theoretical predictions and observational data. However, due to their computational intensity, these simulations are currently constrained to relatively small volumes. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of utilising dark matter-only simulations to generate observable maps of galaxy clusters using a deep learning approach based on the U-Net architecture. We focus on reconstructing Compton-y parameter maps (SZ maps) and bolometric X-ray surface brightness maps (X-ray maps) from total mass density maps. We leverage data from \textsc{The Three Hundred} simulations, selecting galaxy clusters ranging in mass from $10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}\leq M_{200} \leq 10^{15.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. Despite the machine learning models being independent of baryonic matter assumptions, a notable limitation is their dependency on the underlying physics of hydrodynamical simulations. To evaluate the reliability of our generated observable maps, we employ various metrics and compare the observable-mass scaling relations. For clusters with masses greater than $2 \times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, the predictions show excellent agreement with the ground-truth datasets, with percentage errors averaging (0.5 $\pm$ 0.1)\% for the parameters of the scaling laws.</description>

      <title>A Spectroastrometric Study of the Low-velocity Wind from DG Tau A</title>

Abstract: We obtained high spectral resolution spectra ($\Delta v$ $\sim$ 2.5 km s$^{-1}$) for DG Tau A from 4800 \r{A} to 7500 \r{A} using Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) for the first time. The low-velocity components (LVCs, |$v$| &lt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) were observed in the [O I] 5577, 6300, 6364 \r{A}, [S II] 6716, 6731 \r{A} lines. The offset position spectra observed in the LVCs show a "negative velocity gradient", supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind associated with the LVC emission. The offset position spectra observed in a component within the LVC velocity range between -16 km s$^{-1}$ to -41 km s$^{-1}$, namely, LVC-M, show a "negative velocity gradient'', supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind. With 12-70 au wind lengths measured using spectroastrometry, we estimate a lower limit to the wind mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. In addition to the LVCs, we identify two high-velocity components (HVCs, |$v$| &gt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the collimated jet in 26 lines ([N I], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], [Ca II], [Fe II], H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, He I). The one with a clear spatial offset from the star ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC1) is associated with an internal shock surface of the jet, while the other at the base ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC2) may be a stationary shock component. We find that the observed line profiles and the spatial scales of the LVC emission do not agree with the existing predictions for photoevaporative or magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds. These could be explained by the X-wind model, but synthetic observations are required for detailed comparisons.</description>
