      <title>Rocketquake Seismology with a Falcon 9 Rocket Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of using rocket launches, specifically rocketquakes, as a seismic source to image subsurface velocity and geology of planetary bodies. Toward this goal, we record the seismic vibrations excited by a Falcon 9 rocket launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base (SFB) near Lompoc, California. Nine passive three-component (3C) seismometers were deployed every 18.75 meters along a 45-degree line from the launch site starting at the offset of about 7 km kilometers from the launch pad. Results show that coherent body waves can be recorded with a P-velocity of more than 2.0 km/s and a penetration depth of 1 km or deeper. Stronger Rayleigh waves were also recorded and inverted to give an S-velocity profile to a depth of 60 m. Notably, a 3C recorder placed approximately 15 km from the launch site did not capture any discernible body wave arrivals. The imaging techniques employed for rocketquake seismology integrate inversion methods from earthquake and exploration seismology, yielding the P- and S-velocity profiles of the subsurface. These results suggest that rocket launches as seismic sources will provide unprecedented opportunities for identifying the subsurface hazards, faults, tunnels, water ice, and mineral deposits of planetary bodies and their moons.</description>

      <title>EFKAN: A KAN-Integrated Neural Operator For Efficient Magnetotelluric Forward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotelluric (MT) forward modeling is fundamental for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MT inversion. Neural operators (NOs) have been effectively used for rapid MT forward modeling, demonstrating their promising performance in solving the MT forward modeling-related partial differential equations (PDEs). Particularly, they can obtain the electromagnetic field at arbitrary locations and frequencies. In these NOs, the projection layers have been dominated by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), which may potentially reduce the accuracy of solution due to they usually suffer from the disadvantages of MLPs, such as lack of interpretability, overfitting, and so on. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of MT forward modeling with NOs and explore the potential alternatives to MLPs, we propose a novel neural operator by extending the Fourier neural operator (FNO) with Kolmogorov-Arnold network (EFKAN). Within the EFKAN framework, the FNO serves as the branch network to calculate the apparent resistivity and phase from the resistivity model in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, the KAN acts as the trunk network to project the resistivity and phase, determined by the FNO, to the desired locations and frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves higher accuracy in obtaining apparent resistivity and phase compared to the NO equipped with MLPs at the desired frequencies and locations but also outperforms traditional numerical methods in terms of computational speed.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometrical optics approach has been used to derive instability criteria for various swirling flows observed in nature and industrial processes. By applying a short-wavelength local analysis to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation when necessary, we account for viscosity and thermal diffusivity effects. The derived criteria are validated for swirling flows modeled by a cylindrical differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria successfully reproduce known results from numerical linear stability analysis and agree with experimental and simulation data. Moreover, they unify and extend several classical instability criteria: the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally-driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling flows, thereby generalizing the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Near Real Time AI-NWP Hurricane Forecasts: Improving Explainability and Performance Through Physics-Based Models and Land Surface Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hurricane track forecasting remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between the atmosphere, land, and ocean. Although AI-based numerical weather prediction models, such as Google Graphcast operation, have significantly improved hurricane track forecasts, they currently function as atmosphere-only models, omitting critical land and ocean interactions. To investigate the impact of land feedback, we conducted independent simulations using the physics-based Hurricane WRF experimental model to assess how soil moisture variations influence storm trajectories. Our results show that land surface conditions significantly alter storm paths, demonstrating the importance of land-atmosphere coupling in hurricane prediction. Although recent advances have introduced AI-based atmosphere-ocean coupled models, a fully functional AI-driven atmosphere-land-ocean model does not yet exist. Our findings suggest that AI-NWP models could be further improved by incorporating land surface interactions, improving both forecast accuracy and explainability. Developing a fully coupled AI-based weather model would mark a critical step toward more reliable and physically consistent hurricane forecasting, with direct applications for disaster preparedness and risk mitigation.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are inherently limited to only a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most gamma-ray emitting radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, which in turn compromise effective response and accurate risk assessments in such incidents. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration of any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the entire aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event prediction of the spectrometer's scintillation response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Through a series of validation measurements in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios, we show that the developed model not only effectively addresses the large deficiencies of previous approaches, but also achieves the accuracy and precision required to supersede traditional empirical calibration methods. These results mark a major advancement in AGRS. The developed methodology not only allows for the quantification of any gamma-ray source, but also reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity calibration sources, and eliminates the generation of related radioactive waste. In addition, these advancements offer promising new capabilities for AGRS applications beyond emergency response, including the quantification of the cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray flux in the atmosphere and probing trace-level airborne radionuclides.</description>

      <title>The Physics-Informed Neural Network Gravity Model: Generation III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning and the advent of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) have shown high potential in their ability to solve complex differential equations. One example is the use of PINNs to solve the gravity field modeling problem -- learning convenient representations of the gravitational potential from position and acceleration data. These PINN gravity models, or PINN-GMs, have demonstrated advantages in model compactness, robustness to noise, and sample efficiency when compared to popular alternatives; however, further investigation has revealed various failure modes for these and other machine learning gravity models which this manuscript aims to address. Specifically, this paper introduces the third generation Physics-Informed Neural Network Gravity Model (PINN-GM-III) which includes design changes that solve the problems of feature divergence, bias towards low-altitude samples, numerical instability, and extrapolation error. Six evaluation metrics are proposed to expose these past pitfalls and illustrate the PINN-GM-III's robustness to them. This study concludes by evaluating the PINN-GM-III modeling accuracy on a heterogeneous density asteroid, and comparing its performance to other analytic and machine learning gravity models.</description>
