      <title>scRDiT: Generating single-cell RNA-seq data by diffusion transformers and accelerating sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a groundbreaking technology extensively utilized in biological research, facilitating the examination of gene expression at the individual cell level within a given tissue sample. While numerous tools have been developed for scRNA-seq data analysis, the challenge persists in capturing the distinct features of such data and replicating virtual datasets that share analogous statistical properties. Results: Our study introduces a generative approach termed scRNA-seq Diffusion Transformer (scRDiT). This method generates virtual scRNA-seq data by leveraging a real dataset. The method is a neural network constructed based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). This involves subjecting Gaussian noises to the real dataset through iterative noise-adding steps and ultimately restoring the noises to form scRNA-seq samples. This scheme allows us to learn data features from actual scRNA-seq samples during model training. Our experiments, conducted on two distinct scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrate superior performance. Additionally, the model sampling process is expedited by incorporating Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM). scRDiT presents a unified methodology empowering users to train neural network models with their unique scRNA-seq datasets, enabling the generation of numerous high-quality scRNA-seq samples.

      <title>scCDCG: Efficient Deep Structural Clustering for single-cell RNA-seq via Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for unraveling cellular heterogeneity and diversity, offering invaluable insights for bioinformatics advancements. Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis.

      <title>BEND: Benchmarking DNA Language Models on biologically meaningful tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12570v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes. While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features. BEND is available at https://github.com/frederikkemarin/BEND.</description>
