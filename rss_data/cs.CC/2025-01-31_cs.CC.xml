      <title>Experimental relativistic zero-knowledge proofs with unconditional security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are widely applied in digital economies, such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, for establishing trust and ensuring privacy between untrusted parties. However, almost all ZKPs rely on unproven computational assumptions or are vulnerable to quantum adversaries. We propose and experimentally implement an unconditionally secure ZKP for the graph three-coloring problem by combining subset relativistic bit commitments with quantum nonlocality game. Our protocol achieves a linear relationship between interactive rounds and the number of edges, reducing round complexity and storage requirements by thirteen orders of magnitude, thereby significantly enhancing practical feasibility. Our work illustrates the powerful potential of integrating special relativity with quantum theory in trustless cryptography, paving the way for robust applications against quantum attacks in distrustful internet environments.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Projection-free Online Upper-Linearizable Optimization with Applications to DR-Submodular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for decentralized projection-free optimization, extending projection-free methods to a broader class of upper-linearizable functions. Our approach leverages decentralized optimization techniques with the flexibility of upper-linearizable function frameworks, effectively generalizing traditional DR-submodular function optimization. We obtain the regret of $O(T^{1-\theta/2})$ with communication complexity of $O(T^{\theta})$ and number of linear optimization oracle calls of $O(T^{2\theta})$ for decentralized upper-linearizable function optimization, for any $0\le \theta \le 1$. This approach allows for the first results for monotone up-concave optimization with general convex constraints and non-monotone up-concave optimization with general convex constraints. Further, the above results for first order feedback are extended to zeroth order, semi-bandit, and bandit feedback.</description>

      <title>Exact and Approximate High-Multiplicity Scheduling on Identical Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goemans and Rothvoss (SODA'14) gave a framework for solving problems which can be described as finding a point in $int.cone(P\cap\mathbb{Z}^N)\cap Q$, where $P,Q\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ are (bounded) polyhedra. The running time for solving such a problem is $enc(P)^{2^{O(N)}}enc(Q)^{O(1)}$. This framework can be used to solve various scheduling problems, but the encoding length $enc(P)$ usually involves large parameters like the makespan. We describe three tools to improve the framework:
  - Problem-specific preprocessing can be used to greatly reduce $enc(P)$.
  - By solving a certain LP relaxation and then using the classical result by Frank and Tardos (J. Comb. '87), we get a more compact encoding of $P$ in general.
  - A result by Jansen and Klein (SODA'17) makes the running time depend on the number of vertices of the integer hull of $P$. We provide a new bound for this number that is similar to the one by Berndt et al. (SOSA'21) but better for our setting.
  For example, applied to the scheduling problem $P||C_{\max}$, these tools improve the running time from $(\log(C_{\max}))^{2^{O(d)}}enc(I)^{O(1)}$ to the possibly much better $(\log(p_{\max}))^{2^{O(d)}}enc(I)^{O(1)}$. Here, $p_{\max}$ is the largest processing time, $d$ is the number of different processing times, $C_{\max}$ is the makespan and $enc(I)$ is the encoding length of the instance. On the complexity side, we use reductions from the literature to provide new parameterized lower bounds for $P||C_{\max}$. Finally, we show that the big open question asked by Mnich and van Bevern (Comput. Oper. Res. '18) whether $P||C_{\max}$ is FPT w.r.t. the number of job types $d$ has the same answer as the question whether $Q||C_{\max}$ is FPT w.r.t. the number of job and machine types $d+\tau$ (all in high-multiplicity encoding). The same holds for objective $C_{\min}$.</description>
