      <title>The Hamiltonian of Poly-matrix Zero-sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding a dynamical system fundamentally relies on establishing an appropriate Hamiltonian function and elucidating its symmetries. By formulating agents' strategies and cumulative payoffs as canonically conjugate variables, we identify the Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics of poly-matrix zero-sum games. We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games, and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game theory and machine learning.</description>

      <title>True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics in two-dimensional coupling of quadratic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the structure and limitations of equi-M sets in two-dimensional Complex Quadratic Networks (CQNs). In particular, we aim to describe the relationship between the equi-M set and the parameter domains where the critical orbit converges to periodic attractors (pseudo-bulbs). The two-node case serves as a foundational testbed: its analytical tractability enables the identification of critical phenomena and their dependence on coupling, while offering insight into more general principles. The two-node case is also simple enough to allow for explicit coupling conditions that govern phase transitions between synchronized and desynchronized behavior.
  Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the study reveals that while the period-1 pseudo-bulb closely tracks the boundary of the equi-M set near its main cusp, this correspondence breaks down for higher periods and in regions supporting coexisting attractors. These discrepancies highlight key differences between single-map and coupled dynamics, where equi-M sets no longer provide a full encoding of system combinatorics. These findings clarify the topological and dynamical behavior of low-dimensional CQNs and point toward a sharp increase in complexity as the number of nodes grows, laying the groundwork for future studies of high-dimensional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Diffusivity and Pole-Skipping in the Incoherent Semilocally Critical IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pole-skipping offers compelling evidence for the hydrodynamic origin of chaotic behavior in strongly coupled quantum systems. We demonstrate that the cumulative effect of higher-order corrections to the hydrodynamic diffusive mode, captured by the parameter $\Omega$, determines the thermal diffusivity through chaos parameters, providing new insights into the interplay between chaos and hydrodynamics. In the incoherent limit, where momentum relaxation is pronounced, we show that the thermodynamically stable phase corresponds to a semi-locally critical IR fixed point. This finding extends previous analyses of simple IR fixed points and may offer a gravity dual description for stable phases beyond the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model in the incoherent regime. Additionally, we connect our findings to a universal bound on the thermal diffusion constant in holography, establishing a direct link with the dynamical critical exponent $z$. We derive a new relation, $\Omega = (2-z)/(2z-2)$, and propose that it characterizes the thermodynamically stable phase for generic values of $z$.</description>

      <title>Abundance of weird quasiperiodic attractors in piecewise linear discontinuous maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a class of $n$-dimensional, $n\geq2$, piecewise linear discontinuous maps that can exhibit a new type of attractor, called a weird quasiperiodic attractor. While the dynamics associated with these attractors may appear chaotic, we prove that chaos cannot occur. The considered class of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions, separated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic, beyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real fixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed point itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in nongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment of straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic attractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor, which may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the existence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with different types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of discontinuity sets. In some cases, we describe possible mechanisms leading to the appearance of these attractors. We also give examples in the three-dimensional space. Several properties of this new type of attractor remain open for further investigation.</description>
