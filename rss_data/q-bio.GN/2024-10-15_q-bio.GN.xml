      <title>Lower-dimensional projections of cellular expression improves cell type classification from single-cell RNA sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular diversity at single cell level. It provides a global view of cell-type specification during the onset of biological mechanisms such as developmental processes and human organogenesis. Various statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for cell-type classification. Most of the methods utilizes unsupervised lower dimensional projections obtained from for a large reference data. In this work, we proposed a reference-based method for cell type classification, called EnProCell. The EnProCell, first, computes lower dimensional projections that capture both the high variance and class separability through an ensemble of principle component analysis and multiple discriminant analysis. In the second phase, EnProCell trains a deep neural network on the lower dimensional representation of data to classify cell types. The proposed method outperformed the existing state-of-the-art methods when tested on four different data sets produced from different single-cell sequencing technologies. The EnProCell showed higher accuracy (98.91) and F1 score (98.64) than other methods for predicting reference from reference datasets. Similarly, EnProCell also showed better performance than existing methods in predicting cell types for data with unknown cell types (query) from reference datasets (accuracy:99.52; F1 score: 99.07). In addition to improved performance, the proposed methodology is simple and does not require more computational resources and time. the EnProCell is available at https://github.com/umar1196/EnProCell.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous inference for generalized linear models with unmeasured confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07261v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages. It begins by disentangling marginal and uncorrelated confounding effects to recover the latent coefficients. Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated through lasso-type optimization. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish the identification conditions of various effects and non-asymptotic error bounds. We show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are absent from the model.</description>
