      <title>Boosting Reservoir Computing with Brain-inspired Adaptive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random, fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture. Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while deepening our understanding of neural computation.</description>

      <title>Kernel Ridge Regression for Efficient Learning of High-Capacity Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network capacity. While kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) improve performance via iterative learning, we propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an alternative. KRR learns dual variables non-iteratively via a closed-form solution, offering significant learning speed advantages. We show KRR achieves comparably high storage capacity (reaching ratio 1.5 shown) and noise robustness (recalling from around 80% corrupted patterns) as KLR, while drastically reducing training time, establishing KRR as an efficient method for building high-performance associative memories.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency. Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained, gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL. EPO is evaluated on the Atari Pong and Breakout benchmarks. Experimental results show that EPO improves both policy quality and sample efficiency compared to standard PG and EC methods, making it effective for tasks that require both exploration and local optimization.</description>

      <title>Feature selection based on cluster assumption in PU learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the cluster assumption does not strictly hold.</description>

      <title>Attractor-merging Crises and Intermittency in Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs), generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.</description>

      <title>Embodied Neuromorphic Control Applied on a 7-DOF Robotic Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence towards real-time interaction with the environment is a key aspect of embodied intelligence and robotics. Inverse dynamics is a fundamental robotics problem, which maps from joint space to torque space of robotic systems. Traditional methods for solving it rely on direct physical modeling of robots which is difficult or even impossible due to nonlinearity and external disturbance. Recently, data-based model-learning algorithms are adopted to address this issue. However, they often require manual parameter tuning and high computational costs. Neuromorphic computing is inherently suitable to process spatiotemporal features in robot motion control at extremely low costs. However, current research is still in its infancy: existing works control only low-degree-of-freedom systems and lack performance quantification and comparison. In this paper, we propose a neuromorphic control framework to control 7 degree-of-freedom robotic manipulators. We use Spiking Neural Network to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity of the motion data to improve control accuracy, and eliminate manual parameters tuning. We validated the algorithm on two robotic platforms, which reduces torque prediction error by at least 60% and performs a target position tracking task successfully. This work advances embodied neuromorphic control by one step forward from proof of concept to applications in complex real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning spatial hearing via innate mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.10605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change during and after development. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate the auditory spatial map throughout our lifetimes. This is often thought of as a "supervised" learning process where a "teacher" (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your map. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range spatial auditory map. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signal. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial maps.</description>

      <title>Fleet of Agents: Coordinated Problem Solving with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While numerous frameworks have been developed to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there is a scarcity of methods that effectively balance the trade-off between cost and quality. In this paper, we introduce Fleet of Agents (FoA), a novel and intuitive yet principled framework utilizing LLMs as agents to navigate through dynamic tree searches, employing a genetic-type particle filtering approach. FoA spawns a multitude of agents, each exploring the search space autonomously, followed by a selection phase where resampling based on a heuristic value function optimizes the balance between exploration and exploitation. This mechanism enables dynamic branching, adapting the exploration strategy based on discovered solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark tasks, ``Game of 24'', ``Mini-Crosswords'', and ``WebShop'', utilizing four different LLMs, ``GPT-3.5'', ``GPT-4'', ``LLaMA3.2-11B'', and ``LLaMA3.2-90B''. On average across all tasks and LLMs, FoA obtains a quality improvement of ~5% while requiring only ~40% of the cost of previous SOTA methods. Notably, our analyses reveal that (1) FoA achieves the best cost-quality trade-off among all benchmarked methods and (2) FoA + LLaMA3.2-11B surpasses the Llama3.2-90B model. FoA is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/FoA.</description>
