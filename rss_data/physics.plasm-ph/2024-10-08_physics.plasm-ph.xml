      <title>Gyrokinetic Electromagnetic Particle Simulations in Triangular Meshes with C1 Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triangular mesh-based gyrokinetic scheme enables comprehensive axis-to-edge studies across the entire plasma volume. Our approach employs triangular finite elements with first-derivative continuity (C1), building on previous work to facilitate gyrokinetic simulations. Additionally, we have adopted the mixed variable/pullback scheme for gyrokinetic electromagnetic particle simulations. The filter-free treatment in the poloidal cross-section with triangular meshes introduces unique features and challenges compared to previous treatments using structured meshes. Our implementation has been validated through benchmarks using ITPA-TAE (Toroidicity-induced Alfv\'en Eigenmode) parameters, showing its capability in moderate to small electron skin depth regimes. Additional examinations using experimental parameters confirm its applicability to realistic plasma conditions.</description>

      <title>Omnigenous stellarator equilibria with enhanced stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To build an economically viable stellarator, it is essential to find a configuration that satisfies a set of favorable properties to achieve efficient steady-state nuclear fusion. One such property is omnigenity, which ensures confinement of trapped particles. After creating an omnigenous equilibrium, one must also ensure reduced transport resulting from kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. This study introduces and leverages the GPU-accelerated DESC optimization suite, which is used to design stable high-$\beta$ omnigenous equilibria, achieving Mercier, ideal ballooning, and enhanced kinetic ballooning stability. We explain the link between ideal and kinetic ballooning modes and discover stellarators with second stability, a regime of large pressure gradient where an equilibria becomes ideal ballooning stable.</description>

      <title>Formulation of a one-dimensional electrostatic plasma model for testing the validity of kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a one-dimensional (1-D) model composed of aligned, electrostatically interacting charged disks, conceived in order to address in a computable model the validity of the Bogoliubov assumption on the decay of particle correlations in the Born-Bogoliubov-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. This assumption is a basic premise of plasma kinetic theory. The disk model exhibits spatially 1-D features at short distances, but retains 3-D features at large distances. Here the collective dynamics of this model plasma is investigated by solving the corresponding Vlasov equation. In addition, the implementation of the model for the numerical validation of the Bogoliubov assumption is formulated.</description>

      <title>Classical molecular dynamic simulation to assess the non-Maxwellian behavior of inverse bremsstrahlung heating in weakly coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical molecular-dynamics simulations (CMDS) have been conducted to investigate the non-Maxwellian behavior of a weakly coupled plasma submitted to the inverse bremsstrahlung heating of laser irradiation. It is the so called Langdon effect. It has important consequences on plasma properties. It reduces laser absorption, it modifies atomic physics due to its influence on the free electron population, it alters conduction and any other quantities that depends upon electron velocity distribution (EVD). Here, the Langdon effect has been studied with CMDS using the code LAMMPS where, contrary to Fokker-Plank simulations, widely used in the past, plasma many-body behavior at the microscopic level is taken into account self-consistently. For the first time with CMDS, we have observed the deformation of the instantaneous EVD in Langdon's condition. Anisotropy of these non-Maxwellian effects have been demonstrated at moderate and high intensities. CMDS results (related to the shape of the EVD and to the laser absorption reduction) do not match with previous Fokker-Planck simulations results as well as might have been expected. This should probably stimulate new developments to understand the complex many-body interaction of electrons and ions in a laser irradiated plasma in the future.</description>

      <title>Dense Plasma Opacity from Excited States Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-consistent inclusion of plasma effects in opacity calculations is a significant modeling challenge. As density increases, such effects can no longer be treated perturbatively. Building on a recently published model that addresses this challenge, we calculate opacities of oxygen at solar interior conditions. The new model includes the effects of treating the free electrons consistently with the bound electrons, and the influence of free electron energy and entropy variations are explored. It is found that, relative to a state-of-the-art-model that does not include these effects, the bound free-opacity of the oxygen plasmas considered can increase by 10%.</description>

      <title>Tritium-Lean Fusion Power Plants with Asymmetric Deuterium-Tritium Transport and Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetries in deuterium-tritium (D-T) particle transport and divertor pumping speeds are shown to enhance tritium self-sufficiency in fusion power plants. Using a diffusive particle transport model that links the plasma core, separatrix, and divertor regions, it is shown that reducing tritium transport while increasing deuterium transport improves both tritium burn efficiency and overall fusion power. By selectively increasing deuterium transport, tritium burn efficiency can be further optimized, assuming the availability of asymmetric D-T fueling and advanced divertor technologies. These asymmetries become especially beneficial at high tritium burn efficiencies. In one example, by increasing the D-T particle diffusivity ratio and decreasing the D-T divertor pump speed ratio, each by a factor of five, the tritium burn efficiency increases eleven-fold from 0.026 to 0.29 at fixed fusion power. We propose a novel approach to achieve asymmetric D-T pumping with a divertor re-injection system utilizing a partial ionization plasma centrifuge. In an ARC-class power plant, this approach could yield an order-of-magnitude improvement in tritium burn efficiency. These findings motivate the development of techniques and technologies to reduce core tritium transport and increase tritium divertor pumping speeds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Using Repeated Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm based on repeated measurement to solve initial-value problems for nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which may be generated from partial differential equations in plasma physics. We map a dynamical system to a Hamiltonian form, where the Hamiltonian matrix is a function of dynamical variables. To advance in time, we measure expectation values from the previous time step, and evaluate the Hamiltonian function classically, which introduces stochasticity into the dynamics. We then perform standard quantum Hamiltonian simulation over a short time, using the evaluated constant Hamiltonian matrix. This approach requires evolving an ensemble of quantum states, which are consumed each step to measure required observables. We apply this approach to the classic logistic and Lorenz systems, in both integrable and chaotic regimes. Out analysis shows that solutions' accuracy is influenced by both the stochastic sampling rate and the nature of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Effect of Turbulent Kinetic Helicity on Diffusive \b{eta} effect for Large Scale Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated a plasma system with kinematic viscosity \(\nu = 0.006\) and magnetic diffusivity \(\eta = 0.006\), driven by helical kinetic energy, to study the dynamics of energy and helicity in magnetic diffusion. Using the numerical data obtained, we explored methods to determine the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) coefficients that linearize the nonlinear electromotive force (EMF) and the dynamo process. Initially, we applied conventional statistical approaches such as mean-field theory (MFT), direct interaction approximation (DIA), and eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure. We then proposed a simpler alternative method using large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data to calculate \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). Our findings show that while \(\alpha\) qualitatively aligns with theoretical predictions, \(\beta\) remains negative, indicating an inverse cascade of energy through magnetic diffusion. This deviated from conventional models and was further analyzed using a recursive method in the second moment identity, revealing that small-scale kinetic helicity couples with large-scale current density to transport energy inversely. We validated our method by reproducing the numerically calculated data. The consistency between our method and direct numerical simulations (DNS) suggests that the negative diffusion process in plasma has a physical basis.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of negative and positive spectral lags in GRB prompt phase due to shear Comptonization from a structured jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive spectral lags are commonly observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt phase where soft photons lag behind hard ones in their spectral studies. Opposite to this pattern, a fraction of GRBs show a negative spectral lag where hard photons arrive later compared to soft photons. Similarly, recent Fermi-LAT observations show a late onset of high-energy photons in most GRB observations. A fraction of GRBs show a transition from positive to negative lags. Such negative lags and the spectral lag transition have no convincing explanation. We show that a structured GRB jet with velocity shear naturally produces both positive and negative spectral lags. s gain energy from repeated scattering with shearing layers and subsequently escape from higher altitudes. Hence, these photons are delayed compared to soft photons producing a negative spectral lag. The inner jet has no shear and a positive lag appears providing a unified picture of spectral lags in GRBs. The theory predicts a flip in spectral lag from positive to negative within the evolution of the prompt phase. Comparison of the observed lags with the prediction of the theory limits the possible range of GRB jet Lorentz factors to be a few tens.</description>

      <title>Photospheric hot spots at solar coronal loop footpoints revealed by hyperspectral imaging observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Laser-FLASH: radiobiology at high dose, ultra-high dose-rate, single pulse laser-driven proton source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven proton sources have long been developed with an eye on their potential for medical application to radiation therapy. These sources are compact, versatile, and show peculiar characteristics such as extreme instantaneous dose rates, short duration and broad energy spectrum. Typical temporal modality of laser-driven irradiation, the so-called fast-fractionation, results from the composition of multiple, temporally separated, ultra-short dose fractions. In this paper we present the use of a high-energy laser system for delivering the target dose in a single nanosecond pulse, for ultra-fast irradiation of biological samples. A transport line composed by two permanent magnet quadrupoles and a scattering system is used to improve the dose profile and to control the delivered dose-per-pulse. A single-shot dosimetry protocol for the broad-spectrum proton source using Monte Carlo simulations was developed. Doses as high as 20Gy could be delivered in a single shot, lasting less than 10ns over a 1.0cm diameter sample holder, at a dose-rate exceeding 10^9 Gy/s. Exploratory application of extreme laser-driven irradiation conditions, falling within the FLASH irradiation protocol, are presented for in vitro and in vivo irradiation are presented. A reduction of radiation-induced oxidative stress in-vitro and radiation-induced developmental damage in vivo were observed, whereas anti-tumoral efficacy was confirmed by cell survival assay.</description>

      <title>Provably Positivity-Preserving Constrained Transport (PPCT) Second-Order Scheme for Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a robust and efficient second-order positivity-preserving constrained transport (PPCT) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on non-staggered Cartesian meshes. The PPCT scheme ensures two critical physical constraints: a globally discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition on the magnetic field and the positivity of density and pressure. The method is inspired by a novel splitting technique from [T.A. Dao, M. Nazarov and I. Tomas, J. Comput. Phys., 508:113009, 2024], which divides the MHD system into an Euler subsystem with steady magnetic fields and a magnetic subsystem with steady density and internal energy. To achieve these structure-preserving properties, the PPCT scheme combines a positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume method for the Euler subsystem with a finite difference constrained transport (CT) method for the magnetic subsystem via Strang splitting. The finite volume method employs a new PP limiter that retains second-order accuracy and enforces the positivity of density and pressure, with rigorous proof provided using the geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach [K. Wu and C.-W. Shu, SIAM Review, 65:1031-1073, 2023]. For the magnetic subsystem, we develop an implicit finite difference CT method that conserves energy and maintains a globally DDF constraint. This nonlinear system is efficiently solved to machine precision using an iterative algorithm. Since the CT method is unconditionally energy-stable and conserves steady density and internal energy, the PPCT scheme requires only a mild CFL condition for the finite volume method to ensure stability and the PP property. While the focus is on 2D cases for clarity, the extension to 3D is discussed. Several challenging numerical experiments, including highly magnetized MHD jets with high Mach numbers, validate the PPCT scheme's accuracy, robustness, and high resolution.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Novatron, a novel mirror fusion concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new magnetic mirror-cusp concept is described - the Novatron - with the potential to confine compact and stable fusion plasmas. Traditionally, the major challenges for open field line designs include MHD interchange modes, drift cyclotron loss-cone (DCLC) modes, neoclassical transport, and axial losses of particles and energy. The novel magnetic field configuration features favorable curvature throughout the plasma region, suppressing interchange modes. Moreover, the Novatron is designed to be self-stabilized against DCLC modes by allowing for a large plasma to Larmor radius ratio. The vacuum magnetic field geometry is axisymmetric, mitigating neoclassical transport. The Novatron features a high mirror ratio, providing strong magnetic confinement and suppressed axial losses. This paper describes the fundamental magnetic field topology and outlines the design of the magnet system. MHD interchange stability of anisotropic low-\b{eta} equilibria is demonstrated by derivation of two novel criteria, based on anisotropic ideal MHD and the Chew-Goldberger-Low model, and numerical computation in Novatron geometry. The Novatron design is also placed into a historic context by summarizing challenges faced by both previous and more current mirror/cusp concepts.</description>

      <title>Calculating radio emissions of positive streamer phenomena using 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study radio emissions from positive streamers in air using 3D simulations, from which the radiated electric field is computed by solving Jefimenko's equations. The simulations are performed at 0.5 bar using two photoionization methods: the Helmholtz approximation for a photon density and a Monte Carlo method using discrete photons, with the latter being the most realistic. We consider cases with single streamers, streamer branching, streamers interacting with preionization and streamer-streamer encounters. We do not observe a strong VHF radio signal during or after branching, which is confirmed by lab experiments. This indicates that the current inside a streamer discharges evolves approximately continuously during branching. On the other hand, stochastic fluctuations in streamer propagation due to Monte Carlo photoionization lead to more radio emission being emitted at frequencies of 100 MHz and above. Another process that leads to such high-frequency emission is the interaction of a streamer with a weakly preionized region, which can be present due to a previous discharge. In agreement with previous work, we observe the strongest and highest-frequency emission from streamer encounters. The amount of total energy that is radiated seems to depend primarily on the background electric field, and less on the particular streamer evolution. Finally, we present approximations for the maximal current along a streamer channel and a fit formula for a streamer's current moment.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of tungsten influx rate using line emissions from W$^{5+}$ ions in EAST Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The S/XB ratios (ionization per emitted photon) allow one to relate spectroscopic emissivity measurements to the impurity influx from a localized source. In this work, we determine the tungsten influx by examining two dominant EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) line emissions at 382.13 \AA and 394.07 \AA, corresponding to the $4f 14 5f \rightarrow 4f 14 5d$ radiative transitions of the W$^{5+}$ ion. The ground configuration of W$^{5+}$ consists of the ground level and a metastable level, with the latter having a higher population than the ground state. Therefore, a simple approach assuming that the transitions are independent, i.e., only populated by a unique level source, requires correction. To address this, we have developed a fully collisional-radiative modeling in which 430 levels contribute to the ionization. We have utilized three advanced computational codes -- HULLAC (Hebrew University - Lawrence Livermore Atomic Code), AS (AutoStructure), and FAC (Flexible Atomic Code) -- for the atomic structure calculations. These codes provide the necessary information such as wavelengths, collisional and radiative transition rate coefficients. The FAC code was also used to calculate the direct electron-impact ionization under the distorted-wave approximation. We also included contributions to total ionization from excitation-autoionization processes up to $n = 15$ manifolds from the distorted-wave calculations. Subsequently, we used these results to ascertain the tungsten impurity influx in a dedicated discharge of the EAST tokamak, which operates with full tungsten divertors. In our findings, we observed that for the density range relevant to the edge region of a tokamak reactor, the S/XB ratios are almost independent of electron density but exhibit significant variation with electron temperature.</description>

      <title>Dominance of 2-Minute Oscillations near the Alfv\'en Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves, considered one of the primary candidates for heating and accelerating the fast solar wind, are ubiquitous in spacecraft observations, yet their origin remains elusive. In this study, we analyze data from the first 19 encounters of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and report dominance of 2-minute oscillations near the Alfv\'en surface. The frequency-rectified trace magnetic power spectral density (PSD) of these oscillations indicates that the fluctuation energy is concentrated around 2 minutes for the ``youngest'' solar wind. Further analysis using wavelet spectrograms reveals that these oscillations primarily consist of outward-propagating, spherically polarized Alfv\'en wave bursts. Through Doppler analysis, we show that the wave frequency observed in the spacecraft frame can be mapped directly to the launch frequency at the base of the corona, where previous studies have identified a distinct peak around 2 minutes ($\sim 8$ mHz) in the spectrum of swaying motions of coronal structures observed by SDO AIA. These findings strongly suggest that the Alfv\'en waves originate from the solar atmosphere. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the PSD deformation beyond the Alfv\'en surface supports the idea of dynamic formation of the otherwise absent $1/f$ range in the solar wind turbulence spectrum.</description>
