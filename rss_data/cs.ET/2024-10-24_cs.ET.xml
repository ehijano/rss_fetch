      <title>Data Publishing in Mechanics and Dynamics: Challenges, Guidelines, and Examples from Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-based methods have gained increasing importance in engineering, especially but not only driven by successes with deep artificial neural networks. Success stories are prevalent, e.g., in areas such as data-driven modeling, control and automation, as well as surrogate modeling for accelerated simulation. Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are increasingly performing and helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with creative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek artificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help with, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in mechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized knowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly first-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and test become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data publishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as appropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the past. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in mechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks, showing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in fields where data-driven methods have been booming originally. Possible ways to deal with these challenges are discussed and a set of examples from across different design problems shows how data publishing can be put into practice. The analysis, discussions, and examples are based on the research experience made in a priority program of the German research foundation focusing on research on artificially intelligent design assistants in mechanics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Binary-Input Multi-Valued Output Optical Cascades for Reversible and Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the decomposition from the group theory based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov to design binary input multivalued output quantum cascades realized with optical NOT, SWAP, and Fredkin Gates. We present this method for 3, 5, and 7 valued outputs, but in general it can be used for odd prime valued outputs. The method can be extended to realize hybrid functions with different valued outputs. A class of local transformations is presented that can simplify the final cascade circuits. Using these simplifying transformations, we present an upper bound on the maximum number of gates in an arbitrary $n$-variable input and $k$-valued output function.</description>

      <title>LLM as a code generator in Agile Model Driven Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT4 in the auto generation of code represents a significant advancement, yet it is not without its challenges. The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic training for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model composed of three elements: a classical computer in charge of the data preparation and interpretation; a Gate-based Quantum Computer running the Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) representing the Quantum Neural Network (QNN); and an adiabatic Quantum Computer where the optimization function is executed to find the best parameters for the VQA.
  As of the moment of this writing, the majority of QNNs are being trained using gradient-based classical optimizers having to deal with the barren-plateau effect. Some gradient-free classical approaches such as Evolutionary Algorithms have also been proposed to overcome this effect. To the knowledge of the authors, adiabatic quantum models have not been used to train VQAs.
  The paper compares the results of gradient-based classical algorithms against adiabatic optimizers showing the feasibility of integration for gate-based and adiabatic quantum computing models, opening the door to modern hybrid QML approaches for High Performance Computing.</description>

      <title>Comparing Three Generations of D-Wave Quantum Annealers for Minor Embedded Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03009v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a novel type of analog computation that aims to use quantum mechanical fluctuations to search for optimal solutions of Ising problems. Quantum annealing in the Transverse Ising model, implemented on D-Wave QPUs, are available as cloud computing resources. In this article we report concise benchmarks across three generations of D-Wave quantum annealers, consisting of four different devices, for the NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problems unweighted maximum clique and unweighted maximum cut on random graphs. The Ising, or equivalently QUBO, formulation of these problems do not require auxiliary variables for order reduction, and their overall structure and weights are not highly complex, which makes these problems simple test cases to understand the sampling capability of current D-Wave quantum annealers. All-to-all minor embeddings of size $52$, with relatively uniform chain lengths, are used for a direct comparison across the Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr device topologies. A grid search over annealing times and the minor embedding chain strengths is performed in order to determine the level of reasonable performance for each device and problem type. Experiment metrics that are reported are approximation ratios for non-broken chain samples and chain break proportions. How fairly the quantum annealers sample optimal maximum cliques, for instances which contain multiple maximum cliques, is also quantified using entropy of the measured ground state distributions. The newest generation of quantum annealing hardware, which has a Zephyr hardware connectivity, performed the best overall with respect to approximation ratios and chain break frequencies.</description>

      <title>Optical next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks with internal dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises its physical openness, posing challenges for realizations in physical systems. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delayed inputs. Much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, we show that the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and large-scale Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, increased interpretability and fewer hyperparameters compared to conventional optical RC based on scattering media, while achieving better forecasting performance. Our optical NGRC framework may inspire the realization of NGRC in other physical RC systems, new applications beyond time-series processing, and the development of deep and parallel architectures broadly.</description>
