      <title>Both Text and Images Leaked! A Systematic Analysis of Multimodal LLM Data Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progression of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated superior performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, the issue of data contamination during training creates challenges in performance evaluation and comparison. While numerous methods exist for detecting dataset contamination in large language models (LLMs), they are less effective for MLLMs due to their various modalities and multiple training phases. In this study, we introduce a multimodal data contamination detection framework, MM-Detect, designed for MLLMs. Our experimental results indicate that MM-Detect is sensitive to varying degrees of contamination and can highlight significant performance improvements due to leakage of the training set of multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, We also explore the possibility of contamination originating from the pre-training phase of LLMs used by MLLMs and the fine-tuning phase of MLLMs, offering new insights into the stages at which contamination may be introduced.</description>

      <title>The Concatenator: A Bayesian Approach To Real Time Concatenative Musaicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ``The Concatenator,'' a real time system for audio-guided concatenative synthesis. Similarly to Driedger et al.'s ``musaicing'' (or ``audio mosaicing'') technique, we concatenate a set number of windows within a corpus of audio to re-create the harmonic and percussive aspects of a target audio stream. Unlike Driedger's NMF-based technique, however, we instead use an explicitly Bayesian point of view, where corpus window indices are hidden states and the target audio stream is an observation. We use a particle filter to infer the best hidden corpus states in real-time. Our transition model includes a tunable parameter to control the time-continuity of corpus grains, and our observation model allows users to prioritize how quickly windows change to match the target. Because the computational complexity of the system is independent of the corpus size, our system scales to corpora that are hours long, which is an important feature in the age of vast audio data collections. Within The Concatenator module itself, composers can vary grain length, fit to target, and pitch shift in real time while reacting to the sounds they hear, enabling them to rapidly iterate ideas. To conclude our work, we evaluate our system with extensive quantitative tests of the effects of parameters, as well as a qualitative evaluation with artistic insights. Based on the quality of the results, we believe the real-time capability unlocks new avenues for musical expression and control, suitable for live performance and modular synthesis integration, which furthermore represents an essential breakthrough in concatenative synthesis technology.</description>

      <title>Continuous Sign Language Recognition System using Deep Learning with MediaPipe Holistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign languages are the language of hearing-impaired people who use visuals like the hand, facial, and body movements for communication. There are different signs and gestures representing alphabets, words, and phrases. Nowadays approximately 300 sign languages are being practiced worldwide such as American Sign Language (ASL), Chinese Sign Language (CSL), Indian Sign Language (ISL), and many more. Sign languages are dependent on the vocal language of a place. Unlike vocal or spoken languages, there are no helping words in sign language like is, am, are, was, were, will, be, etc. As only a limited population is well-versed in sign language, this lack of familiarity of sign language hinders hearing-impaired people from communicating freely and easily with everyone. This issue can be addressed by a sign language recognition (SLR) system which has the capability to translate the sign language into vocal language. In this paper, a continuous SLR system is proposed using a deep learning model employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), trained and tested on an ISL primary dataset. This dataset is created using MediaPipe Holistic pipeline for tracking face, hand, and body movements and collecting landmarks. The system recognizes the signs and gestures in real-time with 88.23% accuracy.</description>

      <title>A multi-purpose automatic editing system based on lecture semantics for remote education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote teaching has become popular recently due to its convenience and safety, especially under extreme circumstances like a pandemic. However, online students usually have a poor experience since the information acquired from the views provided by the broadcast platforms is limited. One potential solution is to show more camera views simultaneously, but it is technically challenging and distracting for the viewers. Therefore, an automatic multi-camera directing/editing system, which aims at selecting the most concerned view at each time instance to guide the attention of online students, is in urgent demand. However, existing systems mostly make simple assumptions and focus on tracking the position of the speaker instead of the real lecture semantics, and therefore have limited capacities to deliver optimal information flow. To this end, this paper proposes an automatic multi-purpose editing system based on the lecture semantics, which can both direct the multiple video streams for real-time broadcasting and edit the optimal video offline for review purposes. Our system directs the views by semantically analyzing the class events while following the professional directing rules, mimicking a human director to capture the regions of interest from the viewpoint of the onsite students. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative analyses to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system and its components.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Collecting Training Dataset for 2D Object Detection by Online Visual Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep-learning-based vision systems require the manual annotation of a significant number of images. Such manual annotation is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although previous studies have attempted to eliminate the effort required for annotation, the effort required for image collection was retained. To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop dataset collection method that uses a web application. To counterbalance the workload and performance by encouraging the collection of multi-view object image datasets in an enjoyable manner, thereby amplifying motivation, we propose three types of online visual feedback features to track the progress of the collection status. Our experiments thoroughly investigated the impact of each feature on collection performance and quality of operation. The results suggested the feasibility of annotation and object detection.</description>

      <title>Transferable Learned Image Compression-Resistant Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks can readily disrupt the image classification system, revealing the vulnerability of DNN-based recognition tasks. While existing adversarial perturbations are primarily applied to uncompressed images or compressed images by the traditional image compression method, i.e., JPEG, limited studies have investigated the robustness of models for image classification in the context of DNN-based image compression. With the rapid evolution of advanced image compression, DNN-based learned image compression has emerged as the promising approach for transmitting images in many security-critical applications, such as cloud-based face recognition and autonomous driving, due to its superior performance over traditional compression. Therefore, there is a pressing need to fully investigate the robustness of a classification system post-processed by learned image compression. To bridge this research gap, we explore the adversarial attack on a new pipeline that targets image classification models that utilize learned image compressors as pre-processing modules. Furthermore, to enhance the transferability of perturbations across various quality levels and architectures of learned image compression models, we introduce a saliency score-based sampling method to enable the fast generation of transferable perturbation. Extensive experiments with popular attack methods demonstrate the enhanced transferability of our proposed method when attacking images that have been post-processed with different learned image compression models.</description>

      <title>PIAST: A Multimodal Piano Dataset with Audio, Symbolic and Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While piano music has become a significant area of study in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), there is a notable lack of datasets for piano solo music with text labels. To address this gap, we present PIAST (PIano dataset with Audio, Symbolic, and Text), a piano music dataset. Utilizing a piano-specific taxonomy of semantic tags, we collected 9,673 tracks from YouTube and added human annotations for 2,023 tracks by music experts, resulting in two subsets: PIAST-YT and PIAST-AT. Both include audio, text, tag annotations, and transcribed MIDI utilizing state-of-the-art piano transcription and beat tracking models. Among many possible tasks with the multi-modal dataset, we conduct music tagging and retrieval using both audio and MIDI data and report baseline performances to demonstrate its potential as a valuable resource for MIR research.</description>
