      <title>MAIZX: A Carbon-Aware Framework for Optimizing Cloud Computing Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud computing drives innovation but also poses significant environmental challenges due to its high-energy consumption and carbon emissions. Data centers account for 2-4% of global energy usage, and the ICT sector's share of electricity consumption is projected to reach 40% by 2040. As the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 becomes increasingly urgent, there is a growing need for more efficient and transparent solutions, particularly for private cloud infrastructures, which are utilized by 87% of organizations, despite the dominance of public-cloud systems.
  This study evaluates the MAIZX framework, designed to optimize cloud operations and reduce carbon footprint by dynamically ranking resources, including data centers, edge computing nodes, and multi-cloud environments, based on real-time and forecasted carbon intensity, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), and energy consumption. Leveraging a flexible ranking algorithm, MAIZX achieved an 85.68% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to baseline hypervisor operations. Tested across geographically distributed data centers, the framework demonstrates scalability and effectiveness, directly interfacing with hypervisors to optimize workloads in private, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. MAIZX integrates real-time data on carbon intensity, power consumption, and carbon footprint, as well as forecasted values, into cloud management, providing a robust tool for enhancing climate performance potential while maintaining operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the $h$-majority dynamics with many opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first upper bound on the convergence time to consensus of the well-known $h$-majority dynamics with $k$ opinions, in the synchronous setting, for $h$ and $k$ that are both non-constant values.
  We suppose that, at the beginning of the process, there is some initial additive bias towards some plurality opinion, that is, there is an opinion that is supported by $x$ nodes while any other opinion is supported by strictly fewer nodes.
  We prove that, with high probability, if the bias is $\omega(\sqrt{x})$ and the initial plurality opinion is supported by at least $x = \omega(\log n)$ nodes, then the process converges to plurality consensus in $O(\log n)$ rounds whenever $h = \omega(n \log n / x)$.
  A main corollary is the following: if $k = o(n / \log n)$ and the process starts from an almost-balanced configuration with an initial bias of magnitude $\omega(\sqrt{n/k})$ towards the initial plurality opinion, then any function $h = \omega(k \log n)$ suffices to guarantee convergence to consensus in $O(\log n)$ rounds, with high probability.
  Our upper bound shows that the lower bound of $\Omega(k / h^2)$ rounds to reach consensus given by Becchetti et al.\ (2017) cannot be pushed further than $\widetilde{\Omega}(k / h)$.
  Moreover, the bias we require is asymptotically smaller than the $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ bias that guarantees plurality consensus in the $3$-majority dynamics: in our case, the required bias is at most any (arbitrarily small) function in $\omega(\sqrt{x})$ for any value of $k \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>PAT: a new algorithm for all-gather and reduce-scatter operations at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a new algorithm called PAT, for Parallel Aggregated Trees, and which can be used to implement all-gather and reduce-scatter operations. This algorithm works on any number of ranks, has a logarithmic number of network transfers for small size operations, minimizes long-distance communication, and requires a logarithmic amount of internal buffers, independently from the total operation size. It is aimed at improving the performance of the NCCL library in cases where the ring algorithm would be inefficient, as its linear latency would show poor performance for small sizes and/or at scale.</description>

      <title>WattsOnAI: Measuring, Analyzing, and Visualizing Energy and Carbon Footprint of AI Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among them. This paper presents WattsOnAI, a comprehensive software toolkit for the measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By addressing critical limitations in existing tools, WattsOnAI encourages the research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of AI workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable "Green AI" practices.

      <title>SuperSONIC: Cloud-Native Infrastructure for ML Inferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing computational demand from growing data rates and complex machine learning (ML) algorithms in large-scale scientific experiments has driven the adoption of the Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC) approach. SONIC accelerates ML inference by offloading it to local or remote coprocessors to optimize resource utilization. Leveraging its portability to different types of coprocessors, SONIC enhances data processing and model deployment efficiency for cutting-edge research in high energy physics (HEP) and multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA). We developed the SuperSONIC project, a scalable server infrastructure for SONIC, enabling the deployment of computationally intensive tasks to Kubernetes clusters equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs). Using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, SuperSONIC decouples client workflows from server infrastructure, standardizing communication, optimizing throughput, load balancing, and monitoring. SuperSONIC has been successfully deployed for the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube), and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and tested on Kubernetes clusters at Purdue University, the National Research Platform (NRP), and the University of Chicago. SuperSONIC addresses the challenges of the Cloud-native era by providing a reusable, configurable framework that enhances the efficiency of accelerator-based inference deployment across diverse scientific domains and industries.</description>

      <title>RepuNet: A Reputation System for Mitigating Malicious Clients in DFL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes, message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to 25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior, achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness, and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated learning environments.</description>

      <title>Can One Safety Loop Guard Them All? Agentic Guard Rails for Federated Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Guardian-FC, a novel two-layer framework for privacy preserving federated computing that unifies safety enforcement across diverse privacy preserving mechanisms, including cryptographic back-ends like fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and multiparty computation (MPC), as well as statistical techniques such as differential privacy (DP). Guardian-FC decouples guard-rails from privacy mechanisms by executing plug-ins (modular computation units), written in a backend-neutral, domain-specific language (DSL) designed specifically for federated computing workflows and interchangeable Execution Providers (EPs), which implement DSL operations for various privacy back-ends. An Agentic-AI control plane enforces a finite-state safety loop through signed telemetry and commands, ensuring consistent risk management and auditability. The manifest-centric design supports fail-fast job admission and seamless extensibility to new privacy back-ends. We present qualitative scenarios illustrating backend-agnostic safety and a formal model foundation for verification. Finally, we outline a research agenda inviting the community to advance adaptive guard-rail tuning, multi-backend composition, DSL specification development, implementation, and compiler extensibility alongside human-override usability.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Batch Size Optimization for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them, their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration. Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best training settings across all participants. Our results show that against default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.</description>

      <title>Hear No Evil: Detecting Gradient Leakage by Malicious Servers in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that gradient updates in federated learning (FL) can unintentionally reveal sensitive information about a client's local data. This risk becomes significantly greater when a malicious server manipulates the global model to provoke information-rich updates from clients. In this paper, we adopt a defender's perspective to provide the first comprehensive analysis of malicious gradient leakage attacks and the model manipulation techniques that enable them. Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks cannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently stealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that incorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.
  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks, while theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often detectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we propose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection mechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins, despite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic FL settings. This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending against these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard for privacy-conscious federated learning systems.</description>

Abstract: AI integration is revolutionizing the landscape of HPC simulations, enhancing the importance, use, and performance of AI-driven HPC workflows. This paper surveys the diverse and rapidly evolving field of AI-driven HPC and provides a common conceptual basis for understanding AI-driven HPC workflows. Specifically, we use insights from different modes of coupling AI into HPC workflows to propose six execution motifs most commonly found in scientific applications. The proposed set of execution motifs is by definition incomplete and evolving. However, they allow us to analyze the primary performance challenges underpinning AI-driven HPC workflows. We close with a listing of open challenges, research issues, and suggested areas of investigation including the the need for specific benchmarks that will help evaluate and improve the execution of AI-driven HPC workflows.</description>

      <title>On the Encoding Process in Decentralized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of encoding information in a system of N=K+R processors that operate in a decentralized manner, i.e., without a central processor which orchestrates the operation. The system involves K source processors, each holding some data modeled as a vector over a finite field. The remaining R processors are sinks, and each of which requires a linear combination of all data vectors. These linear combinations are distinct from one sink processor to another, and are specified by a generator matrix of a systematic linear error correcting code. To capture the communication cost of decentralized encoding, we adopt a linear network model in which the process proceeds in consecutive communication rounds. In every round, every processor sends and receives one message through each one of its p ports. Moreover, inspired by linear network coding literature, we allow processors to transfer linear combinations of their own data and previously received data. We propose a framework that addresses the decentralized encoding problem on two levels. On the universal level, we provide a solution to the decentralized encoding problem for any possible linear code. On the specific level, we further optimize our solution towards systematic Reed-Solomon codes, as well as their variant, Lagrange codes, for their prevalent use in coded storage and computation systems. Our solutions are based on a newly-defined collective communication operation we call all-to-all encode.</description>

      <title>The Blind Men and the Elephant: Mapping Interdisciplinarity in Research on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are attracting interdisciplinary interest, particularly in business, economics, and computer science. However, much like the parable of the blind men and the elephant, where each observer perceives only a fragment of the whole, DAO research remains fragmented across disciplines, limiting a comprehensive understanding of their potential. This paper assesses the maturity of interdisciplinary research on DAOs by analyzing knowledge flows between Business &amp; Economics and Computer Science through citation network analysis, topic modelling, and outlet analysis. Our findings reveal that while DAOs serve as a vibrant topic of interdisciplinary discourse, current research remains predominantly applied and case-driven, with limited theoretical integration. Strengthening the alignment between organizational and technical insights is crucial for advancing DAO research and fostering a more cohesive interdisciplinary framework.</description>

      <title>MARCO: Multi-Agent Code Optimization with Real-Time Knowledge Integration for High-Performance Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development through code generation capabilities, yet their effectiveness for high-performance computing (HPC) remains limited. HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6\% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9\% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Power-Capping Metric Evaluation for Improving Energy Efficiency in HPC Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With high-performance computing systems now running at exascale, optimizing power-scaling management and resource utilization has become more critical than ever. This paper explores runtime power-capping optimizations that leverage integrated CPU-GPU power management on architectures like the NVIDIA GH200 superchip. We evaluate energy-performance metrics that account for simultaneous CPU and GPU power-capping effects by using two complementary approaches: speedup-energy-delay and a Euclidean distance-based multi-objective optimization method. By targeting a mostly compute-bound exascale science application, the Locally Self-Consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS), we explore challenging scenarios to identify potential opportunities for energy savings in exascale applications, and we recognize that even modest reductions in energy consumption can have significant overall impacts. Our results highlight how GPU task-specific dynamic power-cap adjustments combined with integrated CPU-GPU power steering can improve the energy utilization of certain GPU tasks, thereby laying the groundwork for future adaptive optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>LiteGD: Lightweight and Dynamic GPU Dispatching for Large-scale Heterogeneous Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although multi-GPU execution has become the de-facto paradigm for training and serving large language models (LLMs), today's schedulers still rely on a simple heuristic: pick GPUs that are physically close. This proximity rule was adequate for small, uniform clusters, but it breaks down in modern fabrics where link capacities differ by up to an order of magnitude across PCIe, NVLink, and CXL tiers. Consequently, jobs placed by locality alone often suffer from severe bandwidth imbalance and unpredictable performance. In this paper, We present LiteGD, a lightweight, globally-aware GPU dispatching system that delivers near-optimal bandwidth without incurring prohibitive state or search overheads. Instead of materializing the full O(N^2) connectivity matrix, LiteGD encodes the fabric with a sparsified Tiny-Transformer trained on a few thousand random bandwidth probes, enabling fast adaptation to incremental hardware changes. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to find the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step, which can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We implement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU Bandwidth Efficacy, approximately 90% across various cluster configurations and 80% in a real-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and interconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Maintaining a Bounded Degree Expander in Dynamic Peer-to-Peer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of maintaining robust and sparse overlay networks in fully distributed settings where nodes continuously join and leave the system. This scenario closely models real-world unstructured peer-to-peer networks, where maintaining a well-connected yet low-degree communication graph is crucial. We generalize a recent protocol by Becchetti et al. [SODA 2020] that relies on a simple randomized connection strategy to build an expander topology with high probability to a dynamic networks with churn setting. In this work, the network dynamism is governed by an oblivious adversary that controls which nodes join and leave the system in each round. The adversary has full knowledge of the system and unbounded computational power, but cannot see the random choices made by the protocol. Our analysis builds on the framework of Augustine et al. [FOCS 2015], and shows that our distributed algorithm maintains a constant-degree expander graph with high probability, despite a continuous adversarial churn with a rate of up to $\mathcal{O}(n/polylog(n))$ per round, where $n$ is the stable network size. The protocol and proof techniques are not new, but together they resolve a specific open problem raised in prior work. The result is a simple, fully distributed, and churn-resilient protocol with provable guarantees that align with observed empirical behavior.</description>

      <title>Vertex addition to a ball graph with application to reliability and area coverage in autonomous swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance $1$. These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks, including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.</description>

      <title>Survey: Graph Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24758</link>

Abstract: Graph databases have become essential tools for managing complex and interconnected data, which is common in areas like social networks, bioinformatics, and recommendation systems. Unlike traditional relational databases, graph databases offer a more natural way to model and query intricate relationships, making them particularly effective for applications that demand flexibility and efficiency in handling interconnected data.
  Despite their increasing use, graph databases face notable challenges. One significant issue is the irregular nature of graph data, often marked by structural sparsity, such as in its adjacency matrix representation, which can lead to inefficiencies in data read and write operations. Other obstacles include the high computational demands of traversal-based queries, especially within large-scale networks, and complexities in managing transactions in distributed graph environments. Additionally, the reliance on traditional centralized architectures limits the scalability of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), creating bottlenecks due to contention, CPU overhead, and network bandwidth constraints.
  This paper presents a thorough survey of graph databases. It begins by examining property models, query languages, and storage architectures, outlining the foundational aspects that users and developers typically engage with. Following this, it provides a detailed analysis of recent advancements in graph database technologies, evaluating these in the context of key aspects such as architecture, deployment, usage, and development, which collectively define the capabilities of graph database solutions.</description>
