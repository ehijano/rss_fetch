      <title>Certain Aspects of Deferred Statistical Convergence of Sequences in Probabilistic Normed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research article, we have primarily focused on the circumstantial investigation of deferred statistical convergence of sequences and investigated some fundamental results compatible with the structure of a probabilistic normed space. Additionally, the idea of deferred statistical Cauchy sequences has been discussed with reference to the structure of a probabilistic normed space.</description>

      <title>Free Banach lattices over pre-ordered Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the free Banach lattice over a pre-ordered Banach space in a category of Banach lattices of a given convexity type, and show its existence. The subsumption of a pre-ordering necessitates an approach that differs fundamentally from the known one for the free Banach lattice over a Banach space under a given convexity condition, which is a special case. The relation between the free vector lattice over a pre-ordered Banach space and the free Banach lattice of a given convexity type over it is made explicit. It is determined when precisely the free Banach lattice has a canonical realisation as a lattice of homogeneous continuous functions on the positive part of the unit ball of the dual space. For free $p$-convex Banach lattices with convexity constant 1 over pre-ordered Banach spaces, realisations as function lattices are obtained that generalise those for free Banach lattices of that type over Banach spaces.
  A characterisation of $p$-convex Banach lattices in terms of vector lattice homomorphisms into $\mathrm{L}_p$-spaces or into the real numbers is included.</description>

      <title>Deep convolutional neural networks and data approximation using the fractional Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we define a deep convolutional neural network connected with the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) using the $\theta$-translation operator, the translation operator associated with the FrFT. Subsequently, we study $\theta$-translation invariance properties of this network. Unlike the classical case, these networks are not translation invariant. \par In the second part, we study data approximation problems using the FrFT. More precisely, given a data set $\fl=\{f_1,\cdots, f_m\}\subset L^2(\R^n)$, we obtain $\Phi=\{\phi_1,\cdots,\phi_\ell\}$ such that \[ V_\theta(\Phi)=\argmin\sum_{j=1}^m \|f_j-P_{V}f_j\|^2, \] where the minimum is taken over all $\theta$-shift invariant spaces generated by at most $\ell$ elements. Moreover, we prove the existence of a space of bandlimited functions in the FrFT domain which is ``closest" to $\fl$ in the above sense.</description>

      <title>Polynomial valuations on convex functions and their maximal extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extension problems for polynomial valuations on different cones of convex functions are investigated. It is shown that for the classes of functions under consideration, the extension problem reduces to a simple geometric obstruction on the support of these valuations. The results rely on a homogeneous decomposition for the space of polynomial valuations of bounded degree and the support properties of certain distributions associated to the homogeneous components. As an application, an explicit integral representation for valuations of top degree is established.</description>

      <title>Boundary representations of hyperbolic groups: the log-Sobolev case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study boundary representations of hyperbolic groups $\Gamma$ on the (compactly embedded) function space $W^{\log,2}(\partial\Gamma)\subset L^2(\partial\Gamma)$, the domain of the logarithmic Laplacian on $\partial\Gamma$. We show that they are not uniformly bounded, and establish their exact growth (up a multiplicative constant): they grow with the square root of the length of $g\in\Gamma$. We also obtain $L^p$--analogue of this result. Our main tool is a logarithmic Sobolev inequality on bounded Ahlfors--David regular metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>On the support of free convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend to arbitrary measures results of Bao, Erd\"os, Schnelli, Moreillon, and Ji on the connectedness of the supports of additive convolutions of measures on \mathbb{R} and of free multiplicative convolutions of measures on \mathbb{R}_+. More precisely, the convolution of two measures with connected supports also has connected support. The result holds without any absolute continuity or bounded support hypotheses on the measures being convolved. We also show that the results of Moreillon and Schnelli concerning the number of components of the support of a free additive convolution hold for arbitrary measures with bounded supports. Finally, we provide an approach to the corresponding results in the case of free multiplicative convolutions of probability measures on the unit circle.</description>

      <title>The maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for spaces that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure for metric spaces, which serves as a generalization of the A-by-CE structure for a sequence of group extensions proposed by Deng, Wang, and Yu. We show that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for metric spaces with bounded geometry that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. As an application, the relative expanders constructed by Arzhantseva and Tessera, as well as the box space derived from an extension of Haagerup groups by amenable groups, are shown to exhibit the A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. Consequently, their maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjectures are affirmed.</description>

      <title>Nuclearity, Schatten-von Neumann classes, distribution of eigenvalues and $L^p$-$L^q$-boundedness of Fourier integral operators on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We link Sogge's type $L^p$-estimates for eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on compact manifolds with the problem of providing criteria for the $r$-nuclearity of Fourier integral operators. The classes of Fourier integral operators $I^\mu_{\rho,1-\rho}(X,Y;C)$ considered here are associated with complex canonical relations $C$, i.e. they are parametrised by a complex-valued phase function. Our analysis also includes the case of real canonical relations, namely, the class of Fourier integral operators with real-valued phase functions. The nuclear trace in the sense of Grothendieck is investigated for these operators as well as the validity of the Grothendieck-Lidskii formula on Lebesgue spaces. Criteria are presented in terms of the factorisation condition for the complex canonical relation. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership of Fourier integral operators in Schatten-von Neumann classes are presented in the case where the Schatten index $r&gt;0$ belongs to the set $\mathbb{N} $ and sharp sufficient conditions are presented in the general case $r&gt;0$. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership of Fourier integral operators to the ideal of trace class operators and to the ideal of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on $L^2(X)$. The rate of decay of eigenvalues and the trace of Fourier integral operators is also investigated in both settings, in the Hilbert space case of $L^2(X)$ using Schatten-von Neumann properties and in the context of the Banach spaces $L^p(X),$ $1&lt;p&lt;\infty,$ utilising the notion of $r$-nuclearity.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Random Fourier--Jacobi Series in weighted $\mathrm{L}_{[-1,1]}^{\mathrm{p},(\zeta,\eta)}$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, the random series $\sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty c_m C_m(\varpi)q_m^{(\zeta,\eta)}(u)$ in orthogonal Jacobi polynomials $q_m^{(\zeta,\eta)}(u)$ is discussed. The scalars $c_m$ are Fourier--Jacobi coefficients of a function in the weighted space $\mathrm{L}_{[-1,1]}^\mathrm{p}(d\mu_{\zeta,\eta}),\mathrm{p}&gt;1.$ The random variables $C_m(\varpi)$ are chosen to be the Fourier--Jacobi coefficients of symmetric stable process $Y_{\zeta,\eta}(v,\varpi)$ of index $\chi \in [1,2]$ for $\zeta,\eta \geq 0,$ which are not independent. We prove that, under certain conditions on $\mathrm{p},\zeta$ and $\eta,$ the random Fourier--Jacobi series converges in probability to the stochastic integral \begin{equation*} \int_{-1}^1 \mathfrak{g}(u,v)dY_{\zeta,\eta}(v,\varpi). \end{equation*} We also establish the existence of this integral in the sense of probability for $\mathfrak{g} \in \mathrm{L}_{[-1,1]}^\mathrm{p}(d\mu_{\zeta,\eta}).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Hardy inequalities for antisymmetric functions in three different settings: euclidean space, torus and the integer lattice. In particular, we show that under the antisymmetric condition the sharp constant in Hardy inequality increases substantially and grows as d^4 as d \rightarrow \infty in all cases. As a side product, we prove Hardy inequality on a domain whose boundary forms a corner at the point of singularity x=0.</description>

      <title>Principles of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03600v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to the algebras $A\subset B(H)$ that the linear operators $T:H\to H$ can form, once a complex Hilbert space $H$ is given. Motivated by quantum mechanics, we are mainly interested in the von Neumann algebras, which are stable under taking adjoints, $T\to T^*$, and are weakly closed. When the algebra has a trace $tr:A\to\mathbb C$, we can think of it as being of the form $A=L^\infty(X)$, with $X$ being a quantum measured space. Of particular interest is the free case, where the center of the algebra reduces to the scalars, $Z(A)=\mathbb C$. Following von Neumann, Connes, Jones, Voiculescu and others, we discuss the basic properties of such algebras $A$, and how to do algebra, geometry, analysis and probability on the underlying quantum spaces $X$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic progressions and holomorphic phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the determination of a holomorphic function from its absolute value. Given a parameter $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$, we derive the following characterization of uniqueness in terms of rigidity of a set $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}$: if $\mathcal{F}$ is a vector space of entire functions containing all exponentials $e^{\xi z}, \, \xi \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \{ 0 \}$, then every $F \in \mathcal{F}$ is uniquely determined up to a unimodular phase factor by $\{|F(z)| : z \in e^{i\theta}(\mathbb{R} + i\Lambda)\}$ if and only if $\Lambda$ is not contained in an arithmetic progression $a\mathbb{Z}+b$. Leveraging this insight, we establish a series of consequences for Gabor phase retrieval and Pauli-type uniqueness problems. For instance, $\mathbb{Z} \times \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}$ is a uniqueness set for the Gabor phase retrieval problem in $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, provided that $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}$ is a suitable perturbation of the integers.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation for a Class of Indefinite Elliptic Systems by Comparison Theory for the Spectral Flow via an Index Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider families of strongly indefinite systems of elliptic PDE and investigate bifurcation from a trivial branch of solutions by using the spectral flow. The novelty in our approach is a refined version of a comparison principle that was originally proved by Pejsachowicz in a joint work with the third author, and which is based on an index theorem for a certain class of Fredholm operators that is of independent interest. Finally, we use our findings for a bifurcation problem on shrinking domains that originates from works of Morse and Smale.</description>
