      <title>Sources of matter for wormholes in a k-essence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze some matter sources associated with wormhole models within a k-essence theory coupled to the gravitational sector through a phantom scalar field. We adopt a spherically symmetric background in (3+1) dimensions and consider two types of systems: electrically and magnetically charged. In the first case, we consider the generalized Ellis-Bronnikov model, in which we fix the k-essence field exponent to $n=1/2$ and take the parameter $m\ge 2$, where $m$ is the parameter that modifies the area of this wormhole model. From this we obtained the expression for the scalar field, the potential, and the associated electromagnetic functions for any values of the parameter $m\geq{2}$. In the second and third models, we consider the scenario of two wormholes that are structured according to the adjustment of the parameters that define their area function $\Sigma^2$, and in both cases we adopt $n=1/2$. Finally, we show that the violation of the null energy conditions is conditioned by the parameters of the area function.</description>

      <title>A well-posed BSSN-type formulation for scalar-tensor theories of gravity with second-order field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the modified harmonic and modified puncture gauges have opened new possibilities for performing stable numerical evolutions beyond General Relativity. In this work, we utilise techniques developed in the aforementioned formalisms to derive a BSSN-type formalism compatible with certain classes of modified gravity theories. As an intermediate step, we also derived modified versions of the Z4 and Z3 formalisms, thereby completing the connection between these formalisms beyond General Relativity. We then test the robustness of the new modified BSSN formalism by simulating the dynamics of black hole systems and benchmarking the results against the modified CCZ4 formulation. These developments enable the exploration of theories beyond General Relativity in many well-known Numerical Relativity codes that use different versions of the puncture gauge approach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational synchronization in bosonic dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the search for dark matter remains a central focus of modern astrophysics and high-energy physics, neutron stars provide natural laboratories in which the interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter can be studied. In this work we model dark matter as an ultralight bosonic field, which can accrete onto the neutron star and form a composite object bound through gravity. Using long-term, numerical relativity simulations in spherical symmetry, we extract and analyze the frequency spectra of the radial oscillation modes of fermion-boson stars. Our simulations reveal that the fermionic and bosonic components synchronize through gravitational coupling, enriching their oscillation spectrum. This synchronization leads to new multi-state scalar configurations and reshapes the hierarchy of the neutron-star radial modes. We further propose a procedure to compute the values of the new dominant modes as a function of the bosonic mass, and discuss the implications for neutron-star physics and gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics is gauge independent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics provides a rare window into the elusive quantum nature of gravity. In the first-order formalism for gravitational theories, where torsion and gauge freedom are present, it has been suggested that the first law of black hole thermodynamics requires a specific gauge choice, which would undermine its fundamental character. By using principal fiber bundles, it has been shown that the first law is independent of this gauge choice. The present work introduces an alternative method that establishes this independence in a more direct manner, thereby reinforcing the status of the first law as a guide toward quantum gravity. This method also facilitates explicit computations of the first law and helps resolve several ambiguities that commonly appear in such analyses.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Detection Based on Gravitomagnetic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the feasibility of detecting gravitomagnetic effects generated by gravitational waves, by monitoring the relative orientation of the angular momentum vectors of test particles. We analyze the response of the relative angular momentum direction to all six polarization modes of gravitational waves and estimate the magnitude of its variation during gravitational wave events. Our findings indicate that when test particles possess magnetic moments, applying an external magnetic field of appropriate strength can induce resonant precession of the angular momentum direction under the influence of gravitational waves. This resonance may significantly amplify the gravitational wave signal, potentially enabling its detection with future gyroscope-based detectors. Such detectors would complement existing gravitational wave observatories that rely on gravitoelectric effects.</description>

      <title>Vibration Isolation for the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) presents a novel concept for observing gravitational waves from astrophysical sources at sub-Hertz frequencies. Compared to the Earth, the seismic environment of the moon, while uncertain, is known to be orders of magnitude lower, opening the possibility for achieving this sub-Hz band. This band fills the gap between space-based detectors (mHz) and Earth-based detectors (10 Hz to a few kHz). The initial version of LILA, known as LILA Pioneer, calls for non-suspended optics, relying on the moon's resonant modes to respond to gravitational waves. However, the follow-on design, LILA Horizon, requires suspensions to realize in-band free floating test masses and to filter the residual seismic background. This paper will establish baseline designs for these suspensions for different assumptions of the seismic background.</description>

      <title>Mixmaster Fluids Near the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the approach to the singularity in $\mathbb{T}^{2}$-symmetric cosmological spacetimes containing a non-stiff perfect fluid satisfying a linear equation of state $p=K\rho$, $K \in [0,1)$. Near the singularity, the dynamics are found to be local and oscillatory. In particular, our results show, for the first time, that the fluid velocity in inhomogeneous cosmologies develops mixmaster-esque oscillations consistent with the generalised BKL conjecture of Uggla et al. Moreover, we find these fluid oscillations are responsible for the development of local inhomogeneities in the matter density of the early universe.</description>

      <title>A Global Isometric Embedding of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om Metric into Pseudo-Euclidean Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The event horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole has been well studied and the singular behavior of the Schwarzschild metric on horizon is understood as a coordinate singularity rather than an essential singularity. One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime. While the Reissner-Nordstr\"om embedding presented has several similarities to the Fronsdal embedding of the Schwarzschild metric, the presence of the second horizon requires additional embedding coordinates and terms not found in the Fronsdal embedding, in order that the embedding is defined and finite on each horizon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Foundations and Exact Solutions in $n$--Dimensional Fractional Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three theoretically plausible techniques to developing a fractional scalar field cosmological model are pointed in this paper; the time-dependent kernel weighted action being then selected. Upon this choice, we proceed to establish a fractional cosmological model in $n$ dimensions considering the FLRW metric and a generalized version of the S\'{a}ez-Ballester (SB) theory. Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated.
  Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects. Furthermore, the model's predictions are compared with those of the corresponding standard models and observational data.
  Lastly, we propose new ideas to further generalize our model, with a focus on constructing an effective potential and investigating the conditions under which bounce solutions may emerge.</description>

      <title>The cosmological volume function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work, the regular cosmological volume function $\tau_V$ was introduced as an alternative to the regular cosmological time function of Andersson, Galloway, and Howard. In this paper, we show that in many cases of interest, $\tau_V$ is a continuously differentiable temporal function. This leads to a canonical splitting of the metric tensor, and induces a canonical ``Wick-rotated" Riemannian metric. We also provide some further results and examples related to the cosmological time and volume functions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Black Holes, far from Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6</description>

      <title>Cosmic Acceleration from Quantum Gravity: Emergent Inflation and Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanism for the emergence of cosmic acceleration within the mean-field approximation of Group Field Theory models of quantum gravity. Depending on the interaction type, the resulting cosmological dynamics can either feature a late-time attractor corresponding to a dynamical dark energy phase, often with characteristic phantom behavior, including in models inspired by simplicial gravity, or instead support an early slow-roll inflationary epoch driven by the same underlying quantum-gravitational effects. This emergent inflation, effectively captured by a single-field description, can sustain the required expansion, naturally avoids the graceful exit problem, and appears to transition into a persistent, non-accelerating phase consistent with classical expectations.</description>

      <title>Inflation in light of ACT/SPT: a new perspective from Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) have placed the strictest constraints on the primordial scalar perturbation spectrum, reporting a spectral index of $n_s\sim0.967-0.98$ at 95% confidence level. This result indicates a stronger scale invariance of the scalar perturbation than earlier estimates, posing challenges for numerous inflation models. In this work, we propose an appealing inflationary scenario from the Weyl scale-invariant gravity theory dominated by the higher-order curvatures. Specifically, the exponential curvature extensions are introduced to suppress the mass divergence of the inflaton. We find such scenario naturally yields leading-order predictions of $n_s\simeq1-3/(2N)\sim0.97-0.975$ or $n_s\simeq1-5/(3N)\sim0.967-0.972$ for various models, in excellent agreement with the ACT/SPT constraints. This result builds a concrete bridge between theoretical and observational scale invariance, implying an enduring cosmic echo of the primordial symmetry.</description>

      <title>Structure of Chern-Simons Graviton Scattering Amplitudes from Topological Gravity Equivalence Theorem and Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Geometry of non-Gaussianity in transient non-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models predicting abundant primordial black holes (PBHs) and large amplitude of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) often rely on amplified fluctuations over limited scales, typically driven by phase transitions, particle production, or departures from slow-roll evolution. While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak.</description>

      <title>Wet Hair: Global Symmetries in Entanglement Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair"); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian.</description>

      <title>Singularities in Cosmological Loop Correlators II : Non Local Interactions and Flat Space limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-local interactions naturally arise in the ADM formalism after solving the constraint equations and substituting their solutions back into the action. However, the effects of these non-local operators on loop corrections to cosmological correlators remain largely unexplored. Extending the analysis of arXiv:2503.21880 , in this work we compute the $1$-loop bispectrum during slow-roll inflation, including the inverse-Laplacian operators present at cubic and quartic order in the ADM action (in the spatially flat gauge). These non-local vertices introduce non-trivial angular dependencies that significantly complicate the evaluation of loop integrals. We find that the diagrammatic rules of arXiv:2503.21880 for identifying poles and branch cuts in correlators without explicit integration remain valid even in the presence of such non-local interactions. Finally, we derive the flat-space limit of the $1$-loop inflationary correlator and verify it with explicit examples, thereby establishing a direct correspondence between its leading total-energy singularities ($\omega_T\rightarrow0$) and the flat-space scattering amplitude.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Entanglement partners in Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify where the total correlations and entanglement with a chosen degree of freedom reside within the rest of a system, in the context of bosonic many-body Gaussian quantum systems. Our results are organized into two main propositions. First, for pure Gaussian states, we show that every correlated mode possesses a unique single-degree-of-freedom partner that fully captures its correlations (consisting of entanglement), and we provide an explicit construction of this partner from the complex structure of the system's state. Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Milky Way Globular Clusters: Nurseries for Dynamically-Formed Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel self-consistent theoretical framework to characterize the formation, evolution, and merger sites of dynamically-formed black hole binaries, with a focus on explaining the most massive events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5. This cosmic evolution is a crucial signature with significant implications for future detectors like the LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will be capable to probe the high-redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>Thermal Spin Waves from Accelerating Domain Walls via the Unruh Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a wire consisting of a conducting ferromagnetic layer and an insulating antiferromagnetic layer that are coupled. The ferromagnet hosts a domain wall, which is dynamically driven by a charge current. We show that for a specific time-dependent current, the domain wall moves according to a Rindler trajectory. This motion excites spin waves in the antiferromagnetic insulator, and their emission spectrum is characterised by an effective temperature analogous to the Unruh temperature, $T_U = \hbar a/2\pi c k_B$, with a the acceleration of the domain wall, c the maximum antiferromagnetic spin wave velocity, and kB the Boltzmann constant. This thermal signature is a direct consequence of the Unruh effect and could be experimentally observed. Our results establish magnetism as a promising platform for probing relativistic quantum field phenomena. Moreover, since the Unruh effect is inherently linked to entanglement, our proposal provides a route for entangling magnetic domain walls via relativistic effects.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the large-N index analog of the spectrum form factor for ABJM theory in the microcanonical ensemble. In the Cardy-like limit, the most dominant saddle describing the dual black hole decays rapidly at early times. However, the late-time behavior of the spectral form factor is determined by multi-cut saddles, which prevent it from decaying.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum corrections in interacting dark energy cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm m}$ and $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = \Gamma \, \rho_{\rm m} \, \rho_{\rm DE} \, \theta_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $\Gamma$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $\Gamma$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $\Gamma = 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>Fast LISA Likelihood Approximations by Downsampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is due to launch in the mid-2030s. A key challenge for LISA data analysis is efficient Bayesian inference with parametrised gravitational-wave models, particularly for early inspirals of low- and intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, where time series can contain $\sim 10^8$-$10^9$ samples and naive likelihood evaluations become prohibitively expensive. For purely simulated studies, we present a simple time-domain likelihood-approximation scheme for such signals. The method retains only a small subset of samples and defines a modified noise-weighted inner product on this reduced set that closely reproduces the original inner product on the waveform manifold. Because this alters the effective noise model, the scheme is intended for simulated LISA data rather than direct analysis of real LISA data. In our examples, the resulting posteriors agree to high accuracy with those obtained using much denser sampling, while retaining only $10^3$-$10^4$ samples. The computational cost then scales linearly with the number of retained samples $N_s$, so the speed-up is roughly $N/N_s$, where $N$ is the original data length; for realistic LISA-like datasets with $N\sim10^8$-$10^9$ this would correspond to gains of order $10^4$-$10^6$ over straightforward frequency-domain likelihood evaluations of the full dataset. The time-domain formulation is particularly convenient for incorporating waveform modifications from non-trivial astrophysical environments or alternative-gravity effects. The results presented here provide the theoretical basis for the software package \texttt{Dolfen}.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the deflection of light around a BTZ-ModMax black hole, focusing on the influence of the ModMax parameter and the cosmological constant. The trajectories of massless particles are explored through an analysis of null geodesics, providing deeper insights into the gravitational lensing effects in this modified black hole geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we derive the deflection angle of light and provide a detailed examination of how the ModMax parameter and the cosmological constant impact the bending of light. Furthermore, we compare the deflection results obtained for the BTZ-ModMax black hole with those of the charged and static BTZ black hole solution, highlighting key differences and insights into the role of nonlinear electrodynamics in the gravitational lensing phenomena. This study provides valuable insights into the deflection of light in modified black hole solutions within the framework of lower-dimensional geometry, highlighting the complex relationship between nonlinear dynamics and spacetime curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear perturbations on top of the static and spherically symmetric background of dyonic black hole solutions endowed with electric and magnetic charges, as well as a scalar hair, in the lowest-order $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories. The presence of magnetic charges in the background solutions gives rise to a mixing between the odd-parity and even-parity sectors of perturbations, which makes it impossible to analyze each sector separately. Thus, we expand the action up to second order in both odd-parity and even-parity perturbations and derive the general conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities. We apply these general conditions to extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories, which encompass numerous types of concrete models from the literature known to have dyonic black hole solutions with the scalar hair, and examine their stabilities. Our general framework for studying stability conditions and dynamics of perturbations can be applied to a wide variety of theories, including nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to a scalar field, as well as to calculations of black hole quasinormal modes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe, and a perfect fluid with and without interaction to the scalar field. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the cosmological field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. Based on this equivalence, we construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of canonical transformations can relate the solution spaces of different cosmological models, such as of the scalar field and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.</description>

Abstract: The multi-mode acoustic gravitational wave experiment (MAGE) is a high-frequency gravitational wave detection experiment featuring cryogenic quartz bulk acoustic wave resonators operating as sensitive strain antennas in the MHz regime. After 61 days of non-continuous data collection, we present bounds on the observable merger rate density of primordial black hole binary systems of chirp mass $1.2\times10^{-4}M_\odot&lt;\mathcal{M}&lt;1.7\times10^{-9}M_\odot$. The maximum achieved limit on the merger rate density is $\mathcal{R}&gt;1.3\times10^{18}~\mathrm{kpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ which corresponds to constraining yearly mergers to a distance of reach on the order of the solar system, or $1.0\times10^{-6}$ kpc during the observational period. In addition, we exclude significantly rare and strong events similar to those observed in previous predecessor experiments as non-gravitational background signals, utilising coincident analysis between multiple detectors.</description>

      <title>Novel Mechanism for Production of Planck Relics in Third Order Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism for the formation of Planck-scale black hole remnants, or Planck relics. We use the third-order effective field theory corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry and Hawking temperature obtained in the literature to construct a modified evaporation law that departs significantly from Hawking's classical prediction at small masses. At a critical mass $M_{crit}$, the evaporation process comes to a halt: for $c_6 &gt; 0$ the Hawking temperature remains finite while the leading-order mass-loss rate vanishes, whereas for $c_6 &lt; 0$ the Hawking temperature itself drops to zero. In both cases the black hole mass approaches $M_{crit}$ only asymptotically, so that the evaporation time diverges and the objects become stable remnants. The corrected heat capacity exhibits qualitative departures from Hawking's result near the Planckian regime, with a sign change for $c_6 &lt; 0$ and a shifted extremum for $c_6 &gt; 0$. Our results show that cubic curvature corrections in effective field theory naturally give rise to black hole remnants without invoking ad hoc modifications to Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing effects of black holes with quantum hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the no-hair theorem, stationary black holes are uniquely characterized by their mass, charge, and angular momentum. In this paper, we explore quantum hair by deriving the quantum-corrected black hole metric within the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky formalism. The quantum-corrected metric is obtained perturbatively around flat spacetime without assuming either the commutativity between the nonlocal operator and covariant derivatives or the nonlocal Gauss-Bonnet theorem, both of which are adopted in previous studies. Using this metric, we evaluate the deflection angle in the strong-field limit and compute the associated strong gravitational lensing observables, such as the angular separation and the relative magnification. Our results show that as the quantum hair, determined by the number of virtual massless quantum fields in the nonlocal effective action, increases, the photon sphere radius, the strong deflection angle, and the relative magnification all increase, whereas the angular separation decreases. As a result, we demonstrate that the quantum hair affects not only the black hole geometry but also its strong gravitational lensing effects.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>Frequency-domain self-force calculations using Gegenbauer reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of the Gegenbauer procedure for time-domain reconstruction in frequency-domain calculations of the self-force on a particle orbiting a black hole. The conventional technique relies on the so-called method of extended homogeneous solutions (EHSs), which circumvents the Gibbs phenomenon that would otherwise hamper the reconstruction of the particle's field from frequency modes. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of EHS reconstruction deteriorates rapidly with increasing orbital eccentricity, due to large numerical cancellations between frequency-mode contributions. Furthermore, the method is only suitable for bound orbits and cannot be fully applied in scattering scenarios. The Gegenbauer reconstruction procedure involves a reprojection of the partial Fourier representation onto a complementary basis of polynomials. The resulting series converges exponentially while averting the cancellation problem. We demonstrate the procedure with numerical results for the spherical harmonic modes of the scalar field sourced by a scalar charge in orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We illustrate the merits of this approach, and discuss the challenges that remain for a full Gegenbauer-based self-force calculation.</description>

      <title>Ergoregion instability in bosonic stars: scalar mode structure, universality, and weakly nonlinear effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracompact spinning horizonless spacetimes with ergoregions are subject to the ergoregion instability. We systematically investigate the instability of a massless scalar field in a variety of rapidly spinning Proca stars and boson stars using WKB-, frequency-, and time-domain methods. We find universal features in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a zero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple scaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects), the mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably trapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal mode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially growing. The e-folding times are as short as $\tau\sim 10^4 M$ (in terms of the spacetime's ADM mass $M$). Interestingly, we find a near universal relationship between the frequencies and growth rates across all bosonic stars and also compared with Kerr-like objects. Furthermore, we show that weakly nonlinear backreaction of the instability induces a shift in growth rates as well as emission of gravitational waves; we find evidence that these effects lead to an amplification of the unstable process. This suggests that strongly nonlinear interactions are important during the gravitational saturation of the instability.</description>

      <title>Clines and the Analytic Structure of Black Hole Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit black hole perturbations through Heun differential equations, focusing on Frobenius power-series solutions near regular singularities and their connection formulas. Central to our approach is the notion of a cline in the complex plane, which organizes singular points of the differential equations and remain invariant under M\"obius transformations. Building on the cline structure we identified in black hole horizons, we carry out a systematic reduction and relocation of poles in the differential equation to obtain explicit representations of the solutions. We illustrate our approach by extracting the scalar perturbation solutions for the 7-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole and deriving the static scalar tidal Love numbers. These results suggest that clines expose a M\"obius-invariant order within black hole perturbations, rendering black hole perturbation problems remarkably tractable.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations with $\mu$-dependent effective cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $\mu$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $\mu$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $\mu$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. The relation to dark matter is of importance.</description>

      <title>BinaryGFH-v2: Improved method to search for gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact binaries using the Generalized Frequency-Hough Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, inspiraling compact binaries would provide almost smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes. Here, we develop a method to search for ultra-compact binaries with chirp masses ranging from $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M_\odot$. This mass range represents a previously unexplored gap in gravitational-wave searches for compact binaries: it was thought that the signals would too long for matched-filtering analyses but too short for time-frequency pattern-recognition techniques. Despite this, we show that a pattern-recognition technique, the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), can be employed with particular modifications that allow us to handle rapidly spinning-up binaries and to increase the statistical robustness of our method, and call this improved method BinaryGFH-v2. We then design a hypothetical search for binaries in this mass regime, compare the empirical and theoretical sensitivities of this method, and project constraints on formation rate densities and the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose in both current- and future-generation gravitational-wave detectors. Our results show that our method can be used to search for sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact objects in a mass regime that remains to-date unconstrained with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Modeling reflection spectra of super-Eddington X-ray sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic reflection is a common feature in the X-ray observations of accreting compact objects. We present reflux, a new X-ray reflection model for spectral analysis of super-Eddington sources. We develop two relativistic reflection frameworks for super-Eddington accretion: a slim-disk model that self-consistently accounts for disk thickening and self-shadowing, and an optically thick wind model that treats reflection off a funnel-shaped outflow. The slim-disk model offers a geometry where the inner disk thickness is proportional to radius, becoming thicker as the mass accretion rate increases. The wind model measures the opening angle of the funnel, the wind speed, and wind acceleration radius. The slim-disk profile reduces the brightness of the blue horn in the Fe K emission line for a fixed emissivity and significantly changes the intensity profile for a lamppost geometry. The wind model shows a blue-shifted iron line due to high velocity outflows. Both models assume a spherically symmetric spacetime. We apply the wind model to the XMM-Newton spectrum of the tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57, where the Fe K profile is expected to be shaped by scattering in an outflowing funnel. We constrain the opening angle of the funnel and find a high velocity of the wind.</description>

Abstract: We prove Hawking's singularity theorem for spacetime metrics of local Lipschitz regularity. The proof rests on (1) new estimates for the Ricci curvature of regularising smooth metrics that are based upon a quite general Friedrichs-type lemma and (2) the replacement of the usual focusing techniques for timelike geodesics -- which in the absence of a classical ODE-theory for the initial value problem are no longer available -- by a worldvolume estimate based on a segment-type inequality that allows one to control the volume of the set of points in a spacelike surface that possess long maximisers.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential growth and compare our observations with a Bogoliubov description. The growth rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number, which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are switched off.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically global $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes in type IIB supergravity, with $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(3) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry, localised on the $\mathrm{S}^3$ and translationally invariant along the torus. These solutions, with horizons whose spatial cross sections have $\mathrm{S}^4 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ topology, dominate the microcanonical ensemble at low energies. At higher energies, a first-order phase transition occurs to $\mathrm{BTZ} \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes $-$ possessing $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(4) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry and $\mathrm{S}^1 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ horizon topology. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, this transition reflects the spontaneous breaking of the $SO(4)$ R-symmetry of the D1-D5 CFT$_2$ to $SO(3)$. We also compute the expectation value of the scalar operator with lowest conformal dimension in the low-energy phase. Our $SO(3)$-localised black holes $-$ together with the $U(1)^2$-localised solutions of [1] $-$ point to a rich landscape of novel black holes that may approach the $\mathrm{CFT}_2$ sparseness bootstrap condition, and shed light on how macroscopic entanglement in thermal phases encodes microscopic structure via internal directions.</description>

      <title>$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the K\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.</description>

      <title>Stringent Constraints on Gravitational Wave Signatures of Dark Electromagnetism in Neutron Star Binaries</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave interferometers have studied compact object mergers and solidified our understanding of strong gravity. Their increasing precision raises the possibility of detecting new physics, especially in a neutron star binary system that may contain hidden-sector particles. In particular, a new vector force between binary constituents, giving rise to dark electromagnetic phenomena, could measurably alter the inspiral waveforms and thus be constrained by gravitational wave observations. In this work, we critically examine the mechanisms for neutron stars to acquire enough hidden-sector particles with requisite couplings to furnish a detectable signature from dark electromagnetism. We demonstrate that the repulsive nature of vector forces imposes stringent constraints on any putative particle physics model or astrophysical environment which could give rise to such gravitational signatures. We argue that absent an extreme fine-tuning of parameters, such signatures are well out of reach of any current or near-future gravitational wave observatory.</description>

      <title>Island of acoustic black hole in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an analogue information paradox in acoustic black holes which are emerged from the superfluid surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting acoustic black hole contains both acoustic horizons and optical horizon, with analogue Hawking radiation, i.e. phonons, emitted from the outer acoustic horizon. By using the island formula, we calculate the entanglement entropy of analogue Hawking radiation of the acoustic black hole in both non-extremal and extremal cases. In the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons follow the Page curve due to the emergence of islands, and it is approximately proportional to the area of the acoustic horizon at late time. While in the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons diverges, leading to an ill-defined Page time. Our study verifies the unitarity of the analogue gravity system, and provides further insight into the connection between the entanglement entropy and the causal structure of spacetime.</description>
