      <title>KiDS-SBI: Simulation-Based Inference Analysis of KiDS-1000 Cosmic Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) cosmological analysis of cosmic shear two-point statistics from the fourth weak gravitational lensing data release of the ESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). KiDS-SBI efficiently performs non-Limber projection of the matter power spectrum via Levin's method, and constructs log-normal random matter fields on the curved sky for arbitrary cosmologies, including effective prescriptions for intrinsic alignments and baryonic feedback. The forward model samples realistic galaxy positions and shapes based on the observational characteristics, incorporating shear measurement and redshift calibration uncertainties, as well as angular anisotropies due to variations in depth and point-spread function. To enable direct comparison with standard inference, we limit our analysis to pseudo-angular power spectra. The SBI is based on sequential neural likelihood estimation to infer the posterior distribution of spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters from 18,000 realisations. We infer a mean marginal of the growth of structure parameter $S_{8} \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_\mathrm{m} / 0.3)^{0.5} = 0.731\pm 0.033$ ($68 \%$). We present a measure of goodness-of-fit for SBI and determine that the forward model fits the data well with a probability-to-exceed of $0.42$. For fixed cosmology, the learnt likelihood is approximately Gaussian, while constraints widen compared to a Gaussian likelihood analysis due to cosmology dependence in the covariance. Neglecting variable depth and anisotropies in the point spread function in the model can cause $S_{8}$ to be overestimated by ${\sim}5\%$. Our results are in agreement with previous analysis of KiDS-1000 and reinforce a $2.9 \sigma$ tension with constraints from cosmic microwave background measurements. This work highlights the importance of forward-modelling systematic effects in upcoming galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Cosmological Models from Quasars Calibrated with Type Ia Supernova by a Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use quasars calibrated from type Ia supernova (SN Ia) to constrain cosmological models. We consider three different X-ray luminosity ($L_{X}$) - ultraviolet luminosity ($L_{UV}$) relations of quasars, i.e., the standard $L_{X}$-$L_{UV}$ relation and two redshift-evolutionary relations (Type I and Type II) respectively constructed from copula and considering a redshift correction to the luminosity of quasars. Only in the case of the Type I relation, quasars can always provide effective constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we show that, when the observational Hubble data (OHD) are added, the constraints on the absolute magnitude $M$ of SN Ia and the Hubble constant $H_0$ can be obtained. In the $\Lambda$CDM model, the OHD measurements plus quasars with the Type I relation yields $M$ =$-19.321^{+0.085}_{-0.076}$, which is in good agreement with the measurement from SH0ES ($M=-19.253\pm{0.027}$), and $H_0$ = $70.80\pm3.6~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, falling between the measurements from SH0ES and the Planck cosmic microwave background radiation data.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on time-varying cosmological terms: A study of FLRW universe models with $\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores models of the FLRW universe that incorporate a time-varying cosmological term $\Lambda(t)$. Specifically, we assume a power-law form for the cosmological term as a function of the scale factor: $\Lambda(t)=\Lambda_{0} a(t)^{-\alpha}$, where $\Lambda_{0}$ represents the present value of the cosmological term. Then, we derive an exact solution to Einstein's field equations within the framework of $\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmology and determine the best-fit values of the model parameters using the combined $H(z)$ + SNe Ia dataset and MCMC analysis. Moreover, the deceleration parameter demonstrates the accelerating behavior of the universe, highlighting the transition redshift $z_{tr}$, at which the expansion shifts from deceleration to acceleration, with confidence levels of $1-\sigma$ and $2-\sigma$. In addition, we analyze the behavior of the Hubble parameter, jerk parameter, and $Om(z)$ diagnostic. Our analysis leads us to the conclusion that the $\Lambda(t)$CDM model is consistent with present-day observations.</description>

      <title>Detecting unresolved lensed SNe Ia in LSST using blended light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong-gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe) are promising probes for providing absolute distance measurements using gravitational lens time delays. Spatially unresolved LSNe offer an opportunity to enhance the sample size for precision cosmology. We predict that there will be approximately $3$ times more unresolved than resolved LSNe Ia in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Rubin Observatory. In this article, we explore the feasibility of detecting unresolved LSNe Ia from the shape of the observed blended light curves using deep learning techniques, and we find that $\sim 30\%$ can be detected with a simple 1D CNN using well-sampled $rizy$-band light curves (with a false-positive rate of $\sim 3\%$). Even when the light curve is well-observed in only a single band among $r$, $i$, and $z$, detection is still possible with false-positive rates ranging from $\sim 4-7\%$, depending on the band. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these unresolved cases can be detected at an early stage using light curves up to $\sim20$ days from the first observation, with well-controlled false-positive rates, providing ample opportunities for triggering follow-up observations. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of time-delay estimations using solely LSST-like data of unresolved light curves, particularly for doubles, when excluding systems with low time delay and magnification ratio. However, the abundance of such systems among those unresolved in LSST poses a significant challenge. This approach holds potential utility for upcoming wide-field surveys, and overall results could significantly improve with enhanced cadence and depth in the future surveys.</description>

      <title>A Spatially Resolved [CII] Survey of 31 $z\sim7$ Massive Galaxies Hosting Luminous Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The [CII] 158 $\mu$m emission line and the underlying far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum are important tracers for studying star formation and kinematic properties of early galaxies. We present a survey of the [CII] emission lines and FIR continua of 31 luminous quasars at $z&gt;6.5$ using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) at sub-arcsec resolution. This survey more than doubles the number of quasars with [CII] and FIR observations at these redshifts and enables statistical studies of quasar host galaxies deep into the epoch of reionization. We detect [CII] emission in 27 quasar hosts with a luminosity range of $L_{\rm [CII]}=(0.3-5.5)\times10^9~L_\odot$ and detect the FIR continuum of 28 quasar hosts with a luminosity range of $L_{\rm FIR}=(0.5-13.0)\times10^{12}~L_\odot$. Both $L_{\rm [CII]}$ and $L_{\rm FIR}$ are correlated ($\rho\simeq0.4$) with the quasar bolometric luminosity, albeit with substantial scatter. The quasar hosts detected by ALMA are clearly resolved with a median diameter of $\sim$5 kpc. About 40% of the quasar host galaxies show a velocity gradient in [CII] emission, while the rest show either dispersion-dominated or disturbed kinematics. Basic estimates of the dynamical masses of the rotation-dominated host galaxies yield $M_{\rm dyn}=(0.1-7.5)\times10^{11}~M_\odot$. Considering our findings alongside those of literature studies, we found that the ratio between $M_{\rm BH}$ and $M_{\rm dyn}$ is about ten times higher than that of local $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm dyn}$ relation on average but with substantial scatter (the ratio difference ranging from $\sim$0.6 to 60) and large uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A Ramsey Neutron-Beam Experiment to Search for Ultralight Axion Dark Matter at the ESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-intensity neutron beams, such as those available at the European Spallation Source (ESS), provide new opportunities for fundamental discoveries. Here we discuss a novel Ramsey neutron-beam experiment to search for ultralight axion dark matter through its coupling to neutron spins, which would cause the neutron spins to rotate about the velocity of the neutrons relative to the dark matter halo. We estimate that experiments at the HIBEAM beamline at the ESS can improve the sensitivity to the axion-neutron coupling compared to the current best laboratory limits by up to $2-3$ orders of magnitude over the axion mass range $10^{-22} \, \textrm{eV} - 10^{-16}$\,eV.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical PSF Reconstruction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction of the point spread function (PSF) plays an important role in many areas of astronomy, including photometry, astrometry, galaxy morphology, and shear measurement. The atmospheric and instrumental effects are the two main contributors to the PSF, both of which may exhibit complex spatial features. Current PSF reconstruction schemes typically rely on individual exposures, and its ability of reproducing the complicated features of the PSF distribution is therefore limited by the number of stars. Interestingly, in conventional methods, after stacking the model residuals of the PSF ellipticities and (relative) sizes from a large number of exposures, one can often observe some stable and nontrivial spatial patterns on the entire focal plane, which could be quite detrimental to, e.g., weak lensing measurements. These PSF residual patterns are caused by instrumental effects as they consistently appear in different exposures. Taking this as an advantage, we propose a multi-layer PSF reconstruction method to remove such PSF residuals, the second and third layers of which make use of all available exposures together. We test our method on the i-band data of the second release of Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our method successfully eliminates most of the PSF residuals. Using the Fourier\_Quad shear measurement method, we further test the performance of the resulting PSF fields on shear recovery using the field distortion effect. The PSF residuals have strong correlations with the shear residuals, and our new multi-layer PSF reconstruction method can remove most of such systematic errors related to PSF, leading to much smaller shear biases.</description>

      <title>Dark matter and space-time symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine local physics in the presence of global variables: variables associated with the whole of the spacelike surfaces of a foliation. These could be the (pseudo-)constants of nature and their conjugate times, but our statements are more general. Interactions between the local and the global (for example, dependence of the local action on global times dual to constants) degrades full space-time diffeomorphism invariance down to spatial diffeomorphism invariance, and so an extra degree of freedom appears. When these presumably primordial global interactions switch off, the local action recovers full invariance and so the usual two gravitons, but a legacy matter component is left over, bearing the extra degree of freedom. Under the assumption that the preferred foliation is geodesic, this component behaves like dark matter, except that 3 of its 4 local degrees of freedom are frozen, forcing its rest frame to coincide with the preferred foliation. The non-frozen degree of freedom (the number density of the effective fluid) is the survivor of the extra "graviton" present in the initial theory, and keeps memory of all the past global interactions that took place in a given location in the preferred foliation. Such "painted-on" dark matter is best distinguished from the conventional one in situations where the preferred frame would be preposterous if all 4 degrees of freedom of dark matter were available. We provide one example: an outflowing halo of legacy matter with exact escape speed at each point and a very specific profile, surrounding a condensed structure made of normal matter.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of massive, bright, dynamically-active galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of three-dimensional (3D) thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium (ICM) across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of four massive, bright, dynamically-active galaxy clusters (A3667, A2319, A520, and A2146), with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Based on a forward modeling approach developed in previous work, we extend this approach with more generalized ICM density and temperature profiles, allowing us to apply uniformly to the observed X-ray surface brightness profiles to detect edges and measure the 3D thermodynamic profiles of the ICM simultaneously and self-consistently. With the forward modeling analysis, we find, in agreement with previous works, that the obtained 3D thermodynamic structures of the ICM across the edges in A3667 and A2319 are consistent with the characteristics of cold fronts, whereas those in A520 and A2146 are consistent with the nature of shock fronts. We find that the azimuthal distribution of the pressure ratio at the cold front in A3667 shows a different trend from that in A2319. For the shock fronts in A520 and A2146, the observed 3D temperature profiles of the ICM indicate that the temperature is highest at the position of the shock front. In the case of the sector exhibiting M = 2.4 in A520, the ICM temperature appears isothermal with a temperature of ~10 keV until ~300 kpc away from the shock front in the post-shock region, being consistent with the hypothesis of the instant-equilibration model for shock-heating.</description>

      <title>Primordial Nucleosynthesis with Non-Extensive Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional Big Bang model successfully anticipates the initial abundances of 2H(D), 3He, and 4He, aligning remarkably well with observational data. However, a persistent challenge arises in the case of 7Li, where the predicted abundance exceeds observations by a factor of approximately three. Despite numerous efforts employing traditional nuclear physics to address this incongruity over the years, the enigma surrounding the lithium anomaly endures. In this context, we embark on an exploration of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) of light element abundances with the application of Tsallis non-extensive statistics. A comparison is made between the outcomes obtained by varying the non-extensive parameter q away from its unity value and both observational data and abundance predictions derived from the conventional big bang model. A good agreement is found for the abundances of 4He, 3He and 7Li, implying that the lithium abundance puzzle might be due to a subtle fine-tuning of the physics ingredients used to determine the BBN. However, the deuterium abundance deviates from observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Himalayas: The Highest Quasar Density Peak Identified in a 10,000 deg$^2$ Sky with Spatial Discrepancies between Galaxies, Quasars, and IGM HI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the identification of a quasar overdensity in the BOSSJ0210 field, dubbed Cosmic Himalayas, consisting of 11 quasars at $z=2.16-2.20$, the densest overdensity of quasars ($17\sigma$) in the $\sim$10,000 deg$^2$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We present the spatial distributions of galaxies and quasars and an HI absorption map of the intergalactic medium (IGM). On the map of 465 galaxies selected from the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey, we find two galaxy density peaks that do not fall on the quasar overdensity but instead exist at the northwest and southeast sides, approximately 25 $h^{-1}$ comoving-Mpc apart from the quasar overdensity. With a spatial resolution of 15 $h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc in projection, we produce a three-dimensional HI tomography map by the IGM Ly$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of 23 SDSS/eBOSS quasars behind the quasar overdensity. Surprisingly, the quasar overdensity coincides with neither an absorption peak nor a transmission peak of IGM HI but lies near the border separating opaque and transparent volumes, with the more luminous quasars located in an environment with lesser IGM HI. Hence remarkably, the overdensity region traced by the 11 quasars, albeit all in coherently active states, has no clear coincidence with peaks of galaxies or HI absorption densities. Current physical scenarios with mixtures of HI overdensities and quasar photoionization cannot fully interpret the emergence of Cosmic Himalayas, suggesting this peculiar structure is an excellent laboratory to unveil the interplay between galaxies, quasars, and the IGM.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Model for Dark Energy -- Dark Matter Interaction: Scenario for the Hubble Tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter interaction, based on a decaying process of the former constituents into the latter ones. The dynamical equations are constructed following a kinetic formulation, which separates the interacting fluctuations from equilibrium distribution of the both the species. The emerging dynamical picture consists of coupled equations, which are specialized in the case of a Dark Energy equation of state parameter: we deal with a modified Lambda Cold Dark Matter model, which is investigated versus a possible interpretation of the Hubble tension. We compare our model with data corresponding to 6 points of the expansion rate from Type Ia Supernovae. We show that, the proposed model suitably fits data according to a value of the Hubble constant compatible with the SHOES Collaboration measurement. The tension is solved because, essentially for redshift greater than one, the correction to the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model vanishes and its presence does not affect the Planck measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing the evolution of galaxy clusters using SZ effect and non-thermal emission: first results from A1413</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass is the most fundamental property of galaxy clusters. However, measuring it is still a challenge. Calibrating mass from intracluster medium observables such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect is subject to uncertainty and biases because of the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption. On the other hand, merging cluster systems have been shown to exhibit radio emission which implies a link with disturbances from hydrostatic equilibrium. We present work on studying deviations of galaxy cluster gas pressure profile from the average (universal) pressure profile using an example of galaxy cluster Abell 1413 with SZ effect data from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager and Planck. This cluster has also been observed at low radio frequency with the Murchison Widefield Array allowing the investigation of links between gas pressure profile deviations and the presence of radio emission.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the momentum coupling between early dark energy (EDE) and cold dark matter to alleviate cosmological tensions. EDE has exhibited promising efficacy in addressing the Hubble tension, but it exacerbates the large-scale structure tension. We consider the interaction between EDE and cold dark matter, introducing a pure momentum exchange between them to alleviate the large-scale structure tension introduced by the EDE model. We find that this coupling model is consistent with the EDE model, yielding a higher value for $H_0$, which can resolve the Hubble tension. Additionally, the new model exhibits a suppressive effect on structure growth, contributing to the alleviation of the large-scale structure tension. By utilizing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and incorporating various cosmological data, the coupling model constrains the best-fit values for $H_0$ to be $72.23$ km/s/Mpc and for $S_8$ to be 0.8192. Compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, the new models have not fully resolved the large-scale structure tension. However, in contrast to the best-fit value of 0.8316 for $S_8$ obtained from the EDE model, the new model alleviates the negative impact of the EDE model.</description>

      <title>The effect of reionization on direct measurements of the mean free path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the ionizing photon mean free path (MFP) based on composite quasar spectra may point to reionization ending at $z&lt;6$. These measurements are challenging because they rely on assumptions about the proximity zones of the quasars. For example, some quasars might have been close to neutral patches where reionization was still ongoing ("neutral islands"), and it is unclear how they would affect the measurements. We address this question with mock MFP measurements from radiative transfer simulations. We find that, even in the presence of neutral islands, our mock MFP measurements agree to within $30~\%$ with the true spatially averaged MFP in our simulations, which includes opacity from both the ionized medium and the islands. The inferred MFP is sensitive at the $&lt;~50\%$ level to assumptions about quasar environments and lifetimes for realistic models. We demonstrate that future analyses with improved data may require explicitly modeling the effects of neutral islands on the composite spectra, and we outline a method for doing this. Lastly, we quantify the effects of neutral islands on Lyman-series transmission, which has been modeled with optically thin simulations in previous MFP analyses. Neutral islands can suppress transmission at $\lambda_{\rm rest}&lt;912$ Angstroms significantly, up to a factor of 2 for $z_{\rm qso}=6$ in a plausible reionization scenario, owing to absorption by many closely spaced lines as quasar light redshifts into resonance. However, the suppression is almost entirely degenerate with the spectrum normalization and thus does not significantly bias the inferred MFP.</description>

      <title>Coupled Dark Sector Models and Cosmological Tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two coupling models of early dark energy (EDE) and cold dark matter aimed at alleviating cosmological tensions. We utilize the EDE component in the coupling models to relieve the Hubble tension, while leveraging the interaction between dark matter and dark energy to alleviate the large-scale structure tension. The interaction is implemented in the form of pure momentum coupling and Yukawa coupling. We employed various cosmological datasets, including cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia supernovae, the local distance-ladder data (SH0ES), and the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 data, to analyze our models. We first exclude SH0ES data from the entire dataset to constrain the parameters of novel models. We observe that the constraints on $H_0$ from two coupling models are slightly higher than that from the $\Lambda$CDM model, but they exhibit a significant inconsistency with the SH0ES data, consistent with prior research findings in the EDE model. Subsequently, we incorporate SH0ES data to re-constrain the parameters of various models, our findings reveal that both coupling models yield best-fit values for $H_0$ approximately around $72.23$ km/s/Mpc, effectively mitigating the Hubble tension. Similar to the EDE model, the coupling models yield the $S_8$ values that still surpasses the result of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, the best-fit values for $S_8$ obtained with the two new models are 0.8192 and 0.8177, respectively, which are lower than the 0.8316 achieved by the EDE model. Consequently, although our coupling models fail to fully resolve the large-scale structure tension, they partially mitigate the adverse effect of the original EDE model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological constraints on the Variable Chaplygin gas model parameters with latest observational data of the Fast Radio Bursts and compare the results with previous constraints obtained using SNe Ia (Pantheon+SHOES), Gamma Ray Bursts, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Hubble parameter observational data. The Variable Chaplygin gas model is shown to be compatible with these datasets.} We have obtained tighter constraints on model parameters $B_s$ and $n$, using the FRB data set. By using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method we obtain, $B_s$=$0.18\pm 0.10$ , $n=1.10\pm 1.15$ and $H_0$= $70.46\pm 0.66$ with the SNe Ia data set, $B_s$= $0.09\pm0.06$ , $n= 0.44\pm 0.89 $ and $H_0=70.57\pm0.64 $ with the FRB data set, $B_s$=$0.16\pm 0.11$ , $n=1.06\pm 1.25$ and $H_0$= $70.37\pm 0.65$ with the BAO data set, $B_s$=$0.05\pm 0.000$ , $n=1.46\pm 0.23$ and $H_0$= $70.21\pm 0.57$ with the H(z) data set and $B_s$=$0.20\pm 0.11$ , $n=1.25\pm 1.17$ and $H_0$= $70.37\pm 0.64$ with the GRB data set . A good agreement for $H_0$ is observed from these data sets.</description>

      <title>Inverse Gertsenshtein effect as a probe of high-frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, i.e., the graviton-photon conversion in the presence of a magnetic field, to constrain high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). Using existing astrophysical measurements, we compute upper limits on the GW energy densities $\Omega_{\rm GW}$ at 16 different frequency bands. Given the observed magnetisation of galaxy clusters with field strength $B\sim\mu{\rm G}$ correlated on $\mathcal{O}(10)\,{\rm kpc}$ scales, we estimate HFGW constraints in the $\mathcal{O}(10^2)\,{\rm GHz}$ regime to be $\Omega_{\rm GW}\lesssim10^{16}$ with the temperature measurements of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Similarly, we conservatively obtain $\Omega_{\rm GW}\lesssim10^{13} (10^{11})$ in the $\mathcal{O}(10^2)\,{\rm MHz}$ ($\mathcal{O}(10)\,{\rm GHz}$) regime by assuming uniform magnetic field with strength $B\sim0.1\,{\rm nG}$ and saturating the excess signal over the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) reported by radio telescopes such as the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES), LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), and Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and the balloon-borne second generation Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse Emission (ARCADE2) with graviton-induced photons. The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) can tighten these constraints by roughly 10 orders of magnitude, which will be a step closer to reaching the critical value of $\Omega_{\rm GW} = 1$ or the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound of $\Omega_{\rm GW}\simeq1.2\times10^{-6}$. We point to future improvement of the SKA forecast and estimate that proposed CMB measurement at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{0-2})\,{\rm nK}$, such as Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) and Voyage 2050, are needed to viably detect stochastic backgrounds of HFGWs.</description>

      <title>Forecast of CMB TB and EB correlations for AliCPT-1</title>

Abstract: The correlations between T, E modes and B modes in cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which are expected to vanish under parity symmetry, have become a sensitive probe of the new physics beyond the standard model. In this paper, we forecast the estimation of TB and EB cross power spectra using NILC and cILC on AliCPT-1 simulations. We find that, NILC performs better than cILC on TB and EB correlations in light of its lower uncertainties. In terms of the birefringence angle estimation without assuming systematic errors, the combination of CMB TB and EB spectrum from NILC cleaned simulations could reach a sensitivity of $-0.049^\circ&lt;\beta&lt;0.056^\circ$ (95% CL).</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 VI: Cosmological Constraints from the Measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological results from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers from the first year of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), to be released in the DESI Data Release 1. DESI BAO provide robust measurements of the transverse comoving distance and Hubble rate, or their combination, relative to the sound horizon, in seven redshift bins from over 6 million extragalactic objects in the redshift range $0.1&lt;z&lt;4.2$. DESI BAO data alone are consistent with the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with a matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.295\pm 0.015$. Paired with a BBN prior and the robustly measured acoustic angular scale from the CMB, DESI requires $H_0=(68.52\pm0.62)$ km/s/Mpc. In conjunction with CMB anisotropies from Planck and CMB lensing data from Planck and ACT, we find $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.307\pm 0.005$ and $H_0=(67.97\pm0.38)$ km/s/Mpc. Extending the baseline model with a constant dark energy equation of state parameter $w$, DESI BAO alone require $w=-0.99^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$. In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, combinations of DESI with CMB or with SN~Ia individually prefer $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. This preference is 2.6$\sigma$ for the DESI+CMB combination, and persists or grows when SN~Ia are added in, giving results discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the $2.5\sigma$, $3.5\sigma$ or $3.9\sigma$ levels for the addition of Pantheon+, Union3, or DES-SN5YR datasets respectively. For the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with the sum of neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ free, combining the DESI and CMB data yields an upper limit $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072$ $(0.113)$ eV at 95% confidence for a $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$ $(\sum m_\nu&gt;0.059)$ eV prior. These neutrino-mass constraints are substantially relaxed in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. [Abridged.]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric reheating is a generic requirement for models of dark sectors with light species, but its implementation is usually in tension with unique phenomenologies otherwise possible in compelling theories containing dark copies of the Standard Model. We present a simple module to implement asymmetric reheating during a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking phase above some critical temperature. This reinvigorates the possibility of an exactly degenerate mirror sector and the striking phenomenology of composite particles oscillating into their mirror counterparts.</description>

      <title>Slow-rolling scalar dynamics and as solution for the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a theoretical framework to interpret the Hubble tension by means of a slow-rolling dynamics of a self-interacting scalar field. In particular, we split the Friedmann equation in order to construct a system for the three unknowns, corresponding to the Hubble parameter $H$, the scalar field $\phi$ and its self-interaction potential $V$, as functions of the redshift. In the resulting picture, the vacuum energy density is provided by a constant term in the potential $V(\phi)$, while the corresponding small kinetic term is responsible for reproducing the apparent variation of the Hubble constant $H_0$ with the redshift. The emerging solution depends on two free parameters, one of which is fixed to account for the discrepancy between the values of $H_0$ as measured by the Super Nova Ia sample ($H_0=73.6\pm1.1$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (Brout et al., 2022)) and the Planck satellite data ($H_0=67.4\pm0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (Aghanim et al., 2020)), respectively. The other parameter is instead determined by a fitting procedure of the apparent Hubble constant variation across the data corresponding to a 40 bin analysis of the Super Nova Pantheon sample, in each of which $H_0$ has been independently determined. The fundamental result of the present analysis is the emerging Hubble parameter as function of the redshift, which correctly takes the Super Nova Ia prediction at $z=0$ and naturally approaches the profile predicted by a flat $\Lambda$CDM model corresponding to the cosmological parameters detected by Planck. It is remarkable that this achievement is reached without reducing the Super Nova Ia data to a single point for determining $H(z=0)$, but accounting for the distribution over their redshift interval of observation, via the binned analysis.</description>

      <title>Double-graviton production from Standard Model plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal plasma filling the early universe generated a stochastic gravitational wave background that peaks in the microwave frequency range today. If the graviton production rate is expressed as a series in a fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and the temperature over the Planck mass, $T^2_{ } / m_{\rm pl}^2$, then the lowest-order contributions come from single ($\sim \alpha T^2_{ }/m_{\rm pl}^2$) and double ($\sim T^4_{ }/m_{\rm pl}^4$) graviton production via $2\to 2$ scatterings. We show that in the Standard Model, single-graviton production dominates if the maximal temperature is smaller than $4\times 10^{18}_{ }$ GeV. This justifies previous calculations which relied solely on single-graviton production. We mention Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in which the single and double-graviton contributions could be of comparable magnitudes. Finally, we elaborate on what these results imply for the range of applicability of General Relativity as an effective theory.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Bounces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe that the energy and the enthalpy densities can be smeared by two fudge factors that are constrained by the contracted Bianchi identities. Depending on the analytic properties of the smearing functions the underlying cosmological solutions belong to two physically different classes, namely the bounces of the scale factor and the curvature bounces. While the curvature bounces are naturally compatible with a stage of accelerated expansion, the bounces of the scale factor demand an early phase of accelerated contraction even if a short inflationary stage may arise prior to the decelerated regime. Despite the regularity of the underlying solutions, gradient instabilities and singularities do occasionally appear in the evolution of curvature inhomogeneities. After deducing the specific criteria behind these occurrences, the background-independent conclusions are corroborated by a series of concrete examples associated with different forms of the smearing functions. The evolution of the curvature inhomogeneities restricts the ranges of the solutions that turn out to be unsuitable even for a limited description of the pre-inflationary initial data. The same observation holds in the case of the gauge-invariant evolution of the matter density contrast. It is however not excluded that a class of scenarios (mainly associated with the curvature bounces) could indeed avoid the potential instabilities. All in all the present analysis explore a general approach whose results are relevant in all the contexts where bouncing solutions are invoked either as complementary or as alternative to the conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>
