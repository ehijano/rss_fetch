      <title>Secure and Efficient Group Handover Protocol in 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have become an essential part of the fifth-generation (5G) non-terrestrial network (NTN) market. These satellites can enable direct-to-cell connectivity for mobile devices and support various applications with ubiquitous coverage for 5G and beyond networks. However, satellite-based NTNs bring several challenges to the 5G handover protocol design. The high mobility of satellites can lead to signaling storms and security compromises during handovers. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a secure and efficient group handover protocol. The protocol's effectiveness is evaluated on a custom discrete-event simulator and compared against the baseline 5G handover scheme. The simulator is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Time-to-Science by Streaming Detector Data Directly into Perlmutter Compute Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in detector technology have significantly increased the size and complexity of experimental data, and high-performance computing (HPC) provides a path towards more efficient and timely data processing. However, movement of large data sets from acquisition systems to HPC centers introduces bottlenecks owing to storage I/O at both ends. This manuscript introduces a streaming workflow designed for an high data rate electron detector that streams data directly to compute node memory at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), thereby avoiding storage I/O. The new workflow deploys ZeroMQ-based services for data production, aggregation, and distribution for on-the-fly processing, all coordinated through a distributed key-value store. The system is integrated with the detector's science gateway and utilizes the NERSC Superfacility API to initiate streaming jobs through a web-based frontend. Our approach achieves up to a 14-fold increase in data throughput and enhances predictability and reliability compared to a I/O-heavy file-based transfer workflow. Our work highlights the transformative potential of streaming workflows to expedite data analysis for time-sensitive experiments.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G/6G Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic innovation can unleash the potential of the beyond 5G (B5G)/6G communication systems. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven zero-touch network slicing is envisaged as a promising cutting-edge technology to harness the full potential of heterogeneous 6G networks and enable the automation of demand-aware management and orchestration (MANO). The network slicing continues towards numerous slices with micro or macro services in 6G networks, and thereby, designing a robust, stable, and distributed learning mechanism is considered a necessity. In this regard, robust brain-inspired and dopamine-like learning methods, such as Actor-Critic approaches, can play a vital role. The tutorial begins with an introduction to network slicing, reinforcement learning (RL), and recent state-of-the-art (SoA) algorithms. Then, the paper elaborates on the combination of value-based and policy-based methods in the form of Actor-Critic techniques tailored to the needs of future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing queues with deadlines under infrequent monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to improve the percentage of packets meeting their deadline in discrete-time M/M/1 queues with infrequent monitoring. More specifically, we look into policies that only monitor the system (and subsequently take actions) after a packet arrival. We model the system as an MDP and provide the optimal policy for some special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a heuristic algorithm called "AB-n" for general deadlines. Finally, we provide numerical results demonstrating the desirable performance of "AB-n" policies.</description>

      <title>5G cellular systems supported by UAVs, RESs, and RISs (PL: Systemy kom\'orkowe 5G wspierane przez BSP, OZE oraz IPR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper considers energy consumption in 5G cellular networks powered by Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and equipped with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), acting as mobile access points. The study was focused on the energy side of the Radio Access Network (RAN) located in the city of Pozna\'n in Poland. The profit associated with the use of renewable energy generators, i.e. photovoltaic panels (PVP) for base stations (BSs) is presented in the form of two factors: the average number of UAV charges (ANUC) to provide continuous access to mobile services for connected user equipment (UE) terminals, and the average reduction in energy consumption (AREC) of the wireless system.</description>
