      <title>vop_poc_nz: A Python Framework for Distributional Cost-Effectiveness and Value of Perspective Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health economic evaluations are sensitive to the choice of analytical perspective (e.g., health system vs. societal). While guidelines often recommend specific perspectives, the uncertainty associated with this choice - and the potential decision discordance it creates - is rarely quantified. We present vop_poc_nz, a Python package that implements a framework for Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (DCEA) and operationalizes the quantification of perspective uncertainty through the Value of Perspective (VoP) metric. The package provides tools for Markov modeling, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, value of information analysis, and equity impact assessment. Unlike existing tools that treat perspective as a fixed input, vop_poc_nz allows for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple perspectives. This enables decision-makers to estimate the opportunity cost of perspective misalignment. We demonstrate the package's capabilities using case studies from Aotearoa New Zealand.</description>

      <title>Is Jobless Growth Valid in Turkiye? A Sectoral Analysis of the Relationship between Unemployment and Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the validity of jobless growth in Turkiye on sectoral basis. It analyzes the impacts of agriculture, industry, construction and services sectors on unemployment using annual data for the period 2000-2022. ARDL method is applied within the scope of the analysis. The findings are tested with FMOLS and CCR methods. The results show that growth in all sectors reduces the unemployment. A one-unit increase in the share of agriculture sector in GDP decreases the unemployment rate by 0.471 points, 0.680 points in the industrial sector, 0.899 points in the construction sector and 1.383 points in the services sector in the short-run. The long-run coefficients reveal that the impacts of sectoral growth on unemployment are stronger in the long-run than in the short-run. A one unit increase in the share of the agricultural sector in GDP decreases the unemployment rate by 2.380 points, 4.057 points in the industrial sector, 1.761 points in the construction sector and 3.664 points in the services sector in the long-run. These findings show that jobless growth is not valid in Turkiye in general. On the contrary, economic growth plays an important role in reducing unemployment.</description>

      <title>Does Globalization Promote or Hinder Sustainable Development? Evidence from Turkiye on the Three Dimensions of Globalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of globalization on sustainable development in Turkiye. We used the ARDL method with annual data for the period 2000-2021. Results reveal that economic globalization promotes positively to sustainable development in the short run with a coefficient of 0.144 and in the long run with a 0.153 coefficient. Although social globalization has a negative impact with a coefficient of -0.150 in the short run, this effect turns positive with a coefficient of 0.080 in the long run. Political globalization strongly supports sustainable development with a coefficient of 0.254 in the short run and 2.634 in the long run. Finally, total globalization has a positive impact on sustainable development in the short and long run with coefficients of 0.339 and 0.196, respectively.</description>

      <title>Equalizer or amplifier? How AI may reshape human cognitive differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machines have at times equalized physical strength by substituting for human effort, and at other times amplified these differences. Artificial intelligence (AI) may likewise narrow or widen disparities in cognitive ability. Recent evidence from the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) revolution suggests that computers increased inequality by education but reduced it by cognitive ability. Early research on generative AI shows larger productivity gains for less-skilled than for high-skilled workers. Whether AI ultimately acts as an equalizer or an amplifier of human cognitive differences is especially crucial for education systems, which must decide whether -- and how -- to allow students to use AI in coursework and exams. This decision is urgent because employers value workers who can leverage AI effectively rather than operate independently of it.</description>

      <title>Polarization by Design: How Elites Could Shape Mass Preferences as AI Reduces Persuasion Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.</description>

      <title>From Oracle Choice to Oracle Lock-In: An Exploratory Study on Blockchain Oracles Supplier Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As data is an essential asset for any Web3 application, selecting an oracle is a critical decision for its success. To date, academic research has mainly focused on improving oracle technology and internal economics, while the drivers of oracle choice on the client side remain largely unexplored. This study fills this gap by gathering insights from leading Web3 protocols, uncovering their rationale for oracle selection and their preferences when deciding whether to outsource or internalize data request mechanisms. The collected data covers more than 55% of the DeFi market cap and is obtained exclusively by protocol executives, board members, or delegates. Insights support the view that protocol choices are tied to technological dependencies, where immutability of smart contracts amplifies lock-in, preventing agile switching among data providers. Furthermore, when viable third-party solutions exist, protocols overwhelmingly prefer outsourcing rather than building and maintaining internal oracle mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of OECD Countries Based on Energy Trilemma Index: A Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes OECD countries in the context of the energy trilemma index and clusters countries with similar characteristics. In the study, the k-means clustering technique is used. The optimum number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method in combination with the Silhouette Index. Moreover, all results are visualized to enhance comprehensibility. The results show that countries such as Austria, Canada, Finland, and Denmark are in the high energy trilemma group with index scores of 82.2, 82.3, 82.7, and 83.3, respectively. Countries in the high group have achieved a high level of balance between energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. In addition, countries such as Belgium, Hungary, Australia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia are in the medium energy trilemma group with index scores of 76.4, 76.6, 77.1, 77.6, and 78.7, respectively. Countries in the medium group have made progress in balancing the dimensions of the energy trilemma but have not yet reached excellence. However, countries such as Mexico, T\"urkiye, Colombia, and Costa Rica are in the low energy trilemma group with index scores of 63.1, 64.1, 64.8, and 69.3, respectively. These low energy trilemma group countries face significant challenges in balancing energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability and need to make improvements in these areas.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impacts of Economic Growth on Ecosystem and Its Subcomponents in Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impacts of economic growth on ecosystem in Turkiye. The study uses annual data for the period 1995-2021 and the ARDL method. The study utilizes the Ecosystem Vitality Index, a sub-dimension of the Environmental Performance Index. In addition, seven models were constructed to assess in detail the impact of economic growth on different dimensions of the ecosystem. The results show that economic growth has a significant impact in all models analyzed. However, the direction of this impact differs across ecosystem components. Economic growth is found to have a positive impact on agriculture and water resources. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP increases the agriculture and water resources indices by 0.074-0.672%. In contrast, economic growth has a negative impact on biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP reduces the indices of biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality by 0.101-2.144%. The results suggest that the environmental costs of economic growth processes need to be considered. Environmentally friendly policies should be combined with sustainable development strategies to reduce the negative impacts of economic growth.</description>
