      <title>An overview on self-similar graphs, their generalizations, and their associated algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes were originally intended to be complementary material for an introductory course on self-similar graphs and their algebras, presented by the author at the CIMPA School ``K-theory and Operator Algebras'', held in La Plata and Buenos Aires (Argentina) from 28 July to 8 August 2025.
  In these notes, we introduce the concept of self-similar graph, associated with groups acting on graphs. We define the corresponding $C^*$-algebra using different complementary approaches, to understand its basic properties. We also analyze various generalizations that appear in the literature and, in particular, review the relationship of this construction with Zappa-Sz\'ep products. Finally, we present very recent results on homology and $K$-theory for these algebras.</description>

      <title>Regular ideals, Ideal Intersections and Quotients II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of regular ideals in regular inclusions of C*-algebras. Let $B \subseteq A$ be a regular inclusion of C*-algebras satisfying the ideal intersection property and with a faithful invariant pseudo-expectation. A complete description of the regular ideals of $A$ is given using the invariant regular ideals of $B$ and the pseudo-expectation. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a quotient by a regular ideal to preserve the faithful unique pseudo-expectation property.
  Special attention is given throughout to pseudo-Cartan inclusions, i.e. inclusions having a Cartan envelope. We show that the quotient of a pseudo-Cartan inclusion by a regular ideal is again a pseudo-Cartan inclusion, and we describe the Cartan envelope of the quotient.</description>

      <title>A new obstruction to Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a unital $C^*$-algebra containing a closed two-sided ideal $J$ and an operator system $X$. We enlarge $X$ to an operator system $\mathcal{S}(X,J)$ in $\mathbb{M}_2(A)$, and show that in order for $\mathcal{S}(X,J)$ to be hyperrigid, each $*$-representation of $C^*(X)$ annihilating $C^*(X)\cap J$ must admit a unique contractive completely positive extension from $X$ to the larger $C^*$-algebra $C^*(X)+J$. We leverage this implicit additional rigidity constraint to construct counterexamples to Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture. A key condition in our construction is the mutual orthogonality of the atomic projection of $C^*(X)$ and the support projection of $J$, which we interpret as a new obstruction to the conjecture. Specializing to the case where $J$ is the ideal of compact operators on a Hilbert space, we recover as a by-product of our general construction the recent counterexample of Bilich and Dor-On. On the other hand, we find that such a pathology cannot be implemented using our construction when $A$ admits only finite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations, thereby illustrating that the obstruction only manifests itself in noncommutative settings.</description>
