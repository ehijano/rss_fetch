      <title>Analytic semigroups approaching a Schr\"{o}dinger group on real foliated metric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On real metric manifolds admitting a co-dimension one foliation, sectorial operators are introduced that interpolate between the generalized Laplacian and the d'Alembertian. This is used to construct a one-parameter family of analytic semigroups that remains well-defined into the near Lorentzian regime. In the strict Lorentzian limit we identify a sense in which a well-defined Schr\"{o}dinger evolution group arises. For the analytic semigroups we show in addition that: (i) they act as integral operators with kernels that are jointly smooth in the semigroup time and both spacetime arguments. (ii) the diagonal of the kernels admits an asymptotic expansion in (shifted) powers of the semigroup time whose coefficients are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients evaluated on the complex metrics.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the $q$-Heisenberg algebra in the tensor product space $\otimes^2$. We establish its algebraic properties and provide applications to the theory of non-monogenic functions. Our results extend known constructions in $q$-deformed algebras and offer new insights into functional analysis in non-commutative settings.</description>

      <title>Random matrix ensembles and integrable differential identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrable differential identities, together with ensemble-specific initial conditions, provide an effective approach for the characterisation of relevant observables and state functions in random matrix theory. We develop the approach for the unitary and orthogonal ensembles. In particular, we focus on a reduction where the probability measure is induced by a Hamiltonian expressed as a formal series of even interactions. We show that the order parameters for the unitary ensemble, that is associated with the Volterra lattice, solve the modified KP equation. The analogous reduction for the orthogonal ensemble, associated with the Pfaff lattice, leads to a new integrable chain. A key step for the calculation of order parameters solution for the orthogonal ensemble is the evaluation of the initial condition by using a map from orthogonal to skew-orthogonal polynomials. The thermodynamic limit leads to an integrable system (a chain for the orthogonal ensemble) of hydrodynamic type. Intriguingly, we find that the solution to the initial value problem for both the discrete system and its continuum limit are given by the very same semi-discrete dynamical chain.</description>

      <title>Complex structure of time-periodic solutions decoded in Poincar\'{e}-Lindstedt series: the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the rich structure of spherically symmetric time-periodic solutions of the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$. We discover that the families of solutions bifurcating from the eigenmodes of the linearised equation form patterns similar to the ones observed for the cubic wave equation. Alongside the Galerkin approaches, we study them using the new method based on the Pad\'{e} approximants. To do so, we provide a rigorous perturbative construction of solutions. Due to the conformal symmetry, the solutions presented in this work serve as examples of large time-periodic solutions of the conformally coupled scalar field on the anti-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>D-convolution categories and Hopf algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a smooth affine algebraic group $G$, one can attach various D-module categories to it that admit convolution monoidal structure. We consider the derived category of D-modules on $G$, the stack $G/G_{ad}$ and the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules. Combining the work of Beilinson-Drinfeld on D-modules and Hecke patterns with the recent work of the author with Dimofte and Py, we show that each of the above categories (more precisely the equivariant version) is monoidal equivalent to a localization of the DG category of modules of a graded Hopf algebra. As a consequence, we give an explicit braided monoidal structure to the derived category of D-modules on $G/G_{ad}$, which when restricted to the heart, recovers the braiding of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg-Ostrik.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of operators and wave propagation in high-contrast media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper aims to study the spectral properties of elliptic operators with highly inhomogeneous coefficients and related issues concerning wave propagation in high-contrast media. A unified approach to solving problems in bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, as well as in infinite periodic media, is proposed. For a small parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ characterizing the contrast of the components of the medium, the analyticity of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions is established in a neighborhood of $\varepsilon = 0$. Effective operators corresponding to $\varepsilon = 0$ are described.</description>

      <title>Ornstein-Zernike decay of Wilson line observables in the free phase of the \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) lattice Higgs model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the physics literature, the Wilson line observable is believed to have a phase transition between a region with pure exponential decay and a region with Ornstein-Zernike type corrections. In~\cite{f2024b}, we confirmed the first part of this prediction. In this paper, we complement these results by showing that if \( \kappa \) is small and \( \beta \) large compared to the length of the line, then Wilson line expectations have exponential decay with Ornstein-Zernike type behavior.</description>

      <title>Analytical coordinate time at the second post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the analytical expression of the coordinate time $t$ in terms of the eccentric anomaly $u$ at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. The parametrization of $t$ with $u$ permits to reduce at the minimum the presence of discontinuous trigonometric functions. This is helpful as they must be properly connected via accumulation functions to finally have a smooth coordinate time $t(u)$. Another difficulty relies on the presence of an infinite sum, about which we derive a compact form. This effort reveals to be extremely useful for application purposes. Indeed, we need to truncate the aforementioned sum to a certain finite threshold, which strongly depends on the selected parameter values and the accuracy error we would like to achieve. Thanks to our work, this analysis can be easily carried out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instability features associated to topological quantum domains which emerge from the Weyl-Wigner (WW) quantum phase-space description of Gaussian ensembles driven by Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) Hamiltonians are investigated. Hyperbolic equilibrium and stability patterns are then identified and classified according to the associated (nonlinear) AAH Hamiltonian parameters. Besides providing the tools for quantifying the information content of AAH systems, the Wigner flow patterns here discussed suggest a systematic procedure for identifying the role of quantum fluctuations over equilibrium and stability, in a framework which can be straightforwardly extended to describe the evolution of similar/modified AAH systems.</description>

      <title>A fully variational numerical method for structural topology optimization based on a Cahn-Hilliard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a novel numerical method suitable for the solution of topology optimization problems in solid mechanics. The most salient feature of the new approach is that the space and time discrete equations of the numerical method can be obtained as the optimality conditions of a single incremental potential. The governing equations define a gradient flow of the mass in the domain that maximizes the stiffness of the proposed solid, while exactly preserving the mass of the allocated material. Moreover, we propose a change of variables in the model equations that constrains the value of the density within admissible bounds and a continuation strategy that speeds up the evolution of the flow. The proposed strategy results in a robust and efficient topology optimization method that is exactly mass-preserving, does not employ Lagrange multipliers, and is fully variational.</description>

      <title>Magnetic uniform resolvent estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish uniform $L^{p}-L^{q}$ resolvent estimates for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators $H=(i\partial+A(x))^2+V(x)$ in dimension $n \geq 3$. Under suitable decay conditions on the electromagnetic potentials, we prove that for all $z \in \mathbb{C}\setminus[0,+\infty)$ with $|\Im z| \leq 1$, the resolvent satisfies \begin{equation*} \|(H-z)^{-1}\phi\|_{L^{q}}\lesssim|z|^{\theta(p,q)} (1+|z|^{\frac 12 \frac{n-1}{n+1}}) \|\phi\|_{L^{p}} \end{equation*} where $\theta(p,q)=\frac{n}{2}(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{q})-1$. This extends previous results by providing estimates valid for all frequencies with explicit dependence on $z$, covering the same optimal range of indices as the free Laplacian case, and including weak endpoint estimates. We also derive a variant with less stringent decay assumptions when restricted to a smaller parameter range. As an application, we establish the first $L^p-L^{p'}$ bounds for the spectral measure of magnetic Schr\"odinger operators.</description>

      <title>Characterizing High Schmidt Number Witnesses in Arbitrary Dimensions System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A profound comprehension of quantum entanglement is crucial for the progression of quantum technologies. The degree of entanglement can be assessed by enumerating the entangled degrees of freedom, leading to the determination of a parameter known as the Schmidt number. In this paper, we develop an efficient analytical tool for characterizing high Schmidt number witnesses for bipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. Our methods not only offer viable mathematical methods for constructing high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses in theory but also simplify the quantification of entanglement and dimensionality. Most notably, we develop high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses within arbitrary-dimensional systems, with our Schmidt witness coefficients relying solely on the operator Schmidt coefficient. Subsequently, we demonstrate our theoretical advancements and computational superiority by constructing Schmidt number witnesses in arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum systems with Schmidt numbers four and five.</description>

Abstract: We consider the critical temperature for superconductivity, defined via the linear BCS equation. We prove that at weak coupling the critical temperature for a sample confined to a quadrant in two dimensions is strictly larger than the one for a half-space, which in turn is strictly larger than the one for $\mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore, we prove that the relative difference of the critical temperatures vanishes in the weak coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Classical $6j$-symbols for finite dimensional representation of the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper an explicit formula for an arbitrary $6j$-symbol for finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_3$ is derived. A $6j$-symbol is written as a result of substitution of $\pm 1$ into a series of hypergeometric type, which is similar to a $\Gamma$-series, which is a simplest example of a multivariate series of hypergeometric type. The selection rulers for a $6j$-symbol are derived.</description>

Abstract: An explicit description of the multiplicity space that describes occurrences of irreducible representations in a splitting of a tensor product of two irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is given. Using this description an explicit formula for an arbitrary $6j$-symbol for the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is derived. The $6j$-symbol is expressed through a value of a generalized hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and N\'eel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Brane Configurations and Coamoeba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generative AI model to obtain Type IIB brane configurations that realize toric phases of a family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. These 4d N=1 quiver gauge theories are worldvolume theories of a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The Type IIB brane configurations are given by the coamoeba projection of the mirror curve associated with the toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The shape of the mirror curve and its coamoeba projection, as well as the corresponding Type IIB brane configuration and the toric phase of the 4d N=1 theory, all depend on the complex structure moduli parameterizing the mirror curve. We train a generative AI model, a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), that takes a choice of complex structure moduli as input and generates the corresponding coamoeba. This enables us not only to obtain a high-resolution representation of the entire phase space for a family of 4d N=1 theories corresponding to the same toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold, but also to continuously track the movements of the mirror curve and the branes wrapping the curve in the corresponding Type IIB brane configurations during phase transitions associated with Seiberg duality.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Holographic Wilson Loop Expectation Values and Super-Yang-Mills Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a well-known phenomenon in the infrared regime of (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory. While both experimental observations and numerical simulations have robustly confirmed its existence, the underlying physical mechanism remains elusive. Unraveling the theoretical origin of confinement continues to be a profound and longstanding challenge in both physics and mathematics. Motivated by recent advances in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we investigate the Wilson loop expectation values in the large-$N$ limit of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at finite chemical potential, employing a holographic approach within the background of an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane. Our results reveal that quantum gravitational fluctuations in the near-horizon region significantly modify the holographic Wilson loop expectation values. These values exhibit an area-law behavior, indicative of a confining quark-antiquark potential. Within this framework, our findings suggest that confinement in the super-Yang-Mills theory arises as a consequence of near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations in the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane geometry.</description>

      <title>Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. The model is a sinusoidally perturbed Harper model and is similar to the sinusoidally perturbed pendulum. Separatrices connecting hyperbolic fixed points in the unperturbed classical system become chaotic under sinusoidal perturbation. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. For each propagator eigenstate we compute a Husimi distribution in phase space and an energy and energy dispersion from the expectation value of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. Chaotic orbits in the mixed classical system are related to Floquet eigenstates that appear ergodic. For a mixed regular and chaotic system, the energy dispersion can separate the Floquet eigenstates into ergodic and integrable subspaces. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix orbit. We derive a related expression for the associated quantum system from the averaged perturbation in the interaction representation evaluated at states with energy close to the separatrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes review the theory of Fisher information, especially its use in kinetic theory of gases and plasmas. The recent monotonicity theorem by Guillen--Silvestre for the Landau--Coulomb equation is put in perspective and generalised. Following my joint work with Imbert and Silvestre, it is proven that Fisher information is decaying along the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, for all relevant interactions, and from this the once longstanding problem of regularity estimates for very singular collision kernels (very soft potentials) is solved.</description>

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global invertible symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to non-invertible symmetries by considering unitary actions of higher fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ on twisted sector local operators. We propose that the latter transform in $\ast$-representations of the tube algebra associated to $\mathcal{C}$, which we introduce and classify using the notion of higher $S$-matrices of higher braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Tensor products, $q$-characters and $R$-matrices for quantum toroidal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new topological coproduct $\Delta^{\psi}_{u}$ for quantum toroidal algebras $U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{tor}})$ in all untwisted types, leading to a well-defined tensor product on the category $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathrm{int}}$ of integrable representations. This is defined by twisting the Drinfeld coproduct $\Delta_{u}$ with an anti-involution $\psi$ of $U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{tor}})$ that swaps its horizontal and vertical quantum affine subalgebras. Other applications of $\psi$ include generalising the celebrated Miki automorphism from type $A$, and an action of the universal cover of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$.
  Next, we investigate the ensuing tensor representations of $U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{tor}})$, and prove quantum toroidal analogues for a series of influential results by Chari-Pressley on the affine level. In particular, there is a compatibility with Drinfeld polynomials, and the product of irreducibles is generically irreducible. We moreover show that the $q$-character of a tensor product is equal to the product of $q$-characters for its factors. Furthermore, we obtain $R$-matrices with spectral parameter which provide solutions to the (trigonometric, quantum) Yang-Baxter equation, and endow $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathrm{int}}$ with a meromorphic braiding. These moreover give rise to a commuting family of transfer matrices for each module.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied.Classical solutions of the mass-deformed IKKT matrix model can be constructed from semisimple Lie algebras whose dimension matches the number of matrices in the model.We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size tends to infinity.Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric objects.We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of Lie-Poisson algebras (linear Poisson algebras) on the algebraic varieties defined by their Casimir polynomials. Casimir polynomials correspond with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization.This quantization is a generalization of the method for constructing the fuzzy sphere.In order to define the weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the Casimir polynomials, we take a fixed reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of polynomials.The operation of replacing this remainders with representation matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization.As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$. In the case of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this "wrong sign" requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition". Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Notes on color reductions and $\gamma$ traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms to calculate the color factors for the $SU(N)$ gauge group and to evaluate $\gamma$ traces. The aim of these notes is to give a self-contained, proved account of the basic results with particular emphasis on color reductions. We fine tune existing algorithms to make calculations at high loop orders possible.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\b_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}, $$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Arnold Diffusion in the Full Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of Arnold diffusion in the planar full three-body problem, which is expressed as a perturbation of a Kepler problem and a planar circular restricted three-body problem, with the perturbation parameter being the mass of the smallest body. In this context, we obtain Arnold diffusion in terms of a transfer of energy, in an amount independent of the perturbation parameter, between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on a topological method based on correctly aligned windows which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. This approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, such as those in a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>
