      <title>Does the fluid-static equilibrium of a self-gravitating isothermal sphere of van der Waals' gas present multiple solutions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take up the investigation we had to put in the future-work stack at the end of Sec.VB2 of Ref.2, in which we pointed out the obvious necessity to inquire about existence or absence of values of the characteristic numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in correspondence to which the perfect-gas model's self gravitational effects, namely upper boundedness of the gravitational number, spiraling behavior of peripheral density, oscillating behavior of central density, and existence of multiple solutions corresponding to the same value of the gravitational number, appear also for the van der Waals' model. The development of our investigation brings to the conversion of our M$_{2}$ scheme based on a second-order differential equation into an equivalent system of two first-order differential equations that incorporates Milne's homology invariant variables. The converted scheme 1oM$_2$ turns out to be much more efficacious than the M$_{2}$ scheme in terms of numerical calculations' easiness and richness of results. We use the perfect-gas model as benchmark to test the 1oM$_2$ scheme; we re-derive familiar results and put them in a more general and rational perspective that paves the way to deal with the van der Waals' gas model. We introduce variable transformations that turn out to be the key to study (almost) analytically the monotonicity of the peripheral density with respect to variations of the gravitational number. The study brings to the proof that the gravitational number is not constrained by upper boundedness, the peripheral density does not spiral, and the central density does not oscillate for any couple of values assumed by the characteristic numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$; however, multiple solutions corresponding to the same value of the gravitational number can exist but their genesis is completely different from that of the perfect-gas model's multiple solutions. We provide the boundary in the $\alpha,\beta$ plane between the two regions of solution's uniqueness and multiplicity. Finally, by the application of the 1oM$_2$ scheme, we resolve the mystery of the missing steep curve corresponding to Aronson and Hansen's 60km case [29] that we unsuccessfully chased in Ref.2 and we even detect another solution that had somehow escaped the attention of those authors.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: tracking the expansion and merger histories of ionized bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of ionized hydrogen bubbles in the intergalactic medium around early luminous objects is a fundamental process during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In this study, we analyze bubble sizes and their evolution using the state-of-the-art THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulation suite, which self-consistently models radiation transport and realistic galaxy formation throughout a large (95.5 cMpc)^3 volume of the Universe. Analogous to the accretion and merger tree histories employed in galaxy formation simulations, we characterize the growth and merger rates of ionized bubbles by focusing on the spatially-resolved redshift of reionization. By tracing the chronological expansion of bubbles, we partition the simulation volume and construct a natural ionization history. We identify three distinct stages of ionized bubble growth: (1) initial slow expansion around the earliest ionizing sources seeding formation sites, (2) accelerated growth through percolation as bubbles begin to merge, and (3) rapid expansion dominated by the largest bubble. Notably, we find that the largest bubble emerges by z=9-10, well before the midpoint of reionization. This bubble becomes dominant during the second growth stage, and defines the third stage by rapidly expanding to eventually encompass the remainder of the simulation volume and becoming one of the few bubbles actively growing. Additionally, we observe a sharp decline in the number of bubbles with radii around ~10 cMpc compared to smaller sizes, indicating a characteristic scale in the final segmented bubble size distribution. Overall, these chronologically sequenced spatial reconstructions offer crucial insights into the physical mechanisms driving ionized bubble growth during the EoR and provide a framework for interpreting the structure and evolution of reionization itself.</description>

      <title>Why is the Galactic disk so cool?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk of old stars in the Galactic disk have migrated radially by up to several kpc in their lifetimes, yet the disk has remained relatively cool, i.e., the ratio of radial heating to migration has been small. Here, we demonstrate that this small ratio places very strong constraints on which mechanisms could have been responsible for orbital transport in our Galaxy. For instance, Sellwood &amp; Binney's mechanism of nonlinear horseshoe transport by spirals tends to produce too high a ratio of heating to migration, unless the spirals' amplitudes are heavily suppressed away from their corotation resonances, or their pitch angles are significantly larger than is observed. This problem is only made worse if one includes the effect of the Galactic bar, diffusion due to disk or halo substructure, etc. Resonant (but non-horseshoe) scattering by spirals can drive transport consistent with the data, but even this requires some fine-tuning. In short, reproducing both the observed radial migration and the small ratio of heating to migration is a highly nontrivial requirement, and poses a significant challenge to models of the Milky Way's dynamical history, theories of spiral structure, and the identification of 'Milky Way analogues' in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>AT 2021hdr: A candidate tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a binary super massive black hole system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a growing number of facilities able to monitor the entire sky and produce light curves with a cadence of days, in recent years there has been an increased rate of detection of sources whose variability deviates from standard behavior, revealing a variety of exotic nuclear transients. The aim of the present study is to disentangle the nature of the transient AT 2021hdr, whose optical light curve used to be consistent with a classic Seyfert 1 nucleus, which was also confirmed by its optical spectrum and high-energy properties. From late 2021, AT 2021hdr started to present sudden brightening episodes in the form of oscillating peaks in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, and the same shape is observed in X-rays and UV from Swift data. The oscillations occur every about 60-90 days with amplitudes of around 0.2 mag in the g and r bands. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations show no radio emission at milliarcseconds scale. It is argued that these findings are inconsistent with a standard tidal disruption event (TDE), a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH), or a changing-look active galactic nucleus (AGN); neither does this object resemble previous observed AGN flares, and disk or jet instabilities are an unlikely scenario. Here, we propose that the behavior of AT 2021hdr might be due to the tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a BSMBH. In this scenario, we estimate that the putative binary has a separation of about 0.83 mpc and would merge in about 70000 years. This galaxy is located at 9 kpc from a companion galaxy, and in this work we report this merger for the first time. The oscillations are not related to the companion galaxy.</description>

      <title>Reconciling concentration to virial mass relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concentration-virial mass (c-M) relation is a fundamental scaling relation within the standard cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework well established in numerical simulations. However, observational constraints of this relation are hampered by the difficulty of characterising the properties of dark matter haloes. Recent comparisons between simulations and observations have suggested a systematic difference of the c-M relation, with higher concentrations in the latter. In this work, we undertake detailed comparisons between simulated galaxies and observations of a sample of strong-lensing galaxies. We explore several factors of the comparison with strong gravitational lensing constraints, including the choice of the generic dark matter density profile, the effect of radial resolution, the reconstruction limits of observed versus simulated mass profiles, and the role of the initial mass function in the derivation of the dark matter parameters. Furthermore, we show the dependence of the c-M relation on reconstruction and model errors through a detailed comparison of real and simulated gravitational lensing systems. An effective reconciliation of simulated and observed c-M relations can be achieved if one considers less strict assumptions on the dark matter profile, for example, by changing the slope of a generic NFW profile or focusing on rather extreme combinations of stellar-to-dark matter distributions. A minor effect is inherent to the applied method: fits to the NFW profile on a less well-constrained inner mass profile yield slightly higher concentrations and lower virial masses.</description>

      <title>Gas dynamics in an AGN-host galaxy at $z\simeq2.6$: regular rotation, non-circular motions, and mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas dynamics of galaxies provide critical insights into the evolution of both baryons and dark matter (DM) across cosmic time. In this context, galaxies at cosmic noon -- the period characterized by the most intense star formation and black hole activities -- are particularly significant. In this work, we present an analysis of the gas dynamics of PKS 0529-549: a galaxy at $z\simeq2.6$, hosting a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). We use new ALMA observations of the [CI] (2-1) line at a spatial resolution of 0.18$''$ ($\sim$1.5 kpc). We find that (1) the molecular gas forms a rotation-supported disk with $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{\rm v}=6\pm3$ and displays a flat rotation curve out to 3.3 kpc; (2) there are several non-circular components including a kinematically anomalous structure near the galaxy center, a gas tail to the South-West, and possibly a second weaker tail to the East; (3) dynamical estimates of gas and stellar masses from fitting the rotation curve are inconsistent with photometric estimates using standard gas conversion factors and stellar population models, respectively; these discrepancies may be due to systematic uncertainties in the photometric masses, in the dynamical masses, or in the case a more massive radio-loud AGN-host galaxy is hidden behind the gas-rich [CI] emitting starburst galaxy along the line of sight. Our work shows that in-depth investigations of 3D line cubes are crucial for revealing the complexity of gas dynamics in high-$z$ galaxies, in which regular rotation may coexist with non-circular motions and possibly tidal structures.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo T: A perturbed cored dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the dynamical state of gas-rich satellite galaxies at the early moments of their infall into their host systems and the relation to their quenching process are not completely understood at the low-mass regime. Two such nearby systems are the infalling Milky Way (MW) dwarfs Leo~T and Phoenix located near the MW virial radius at $414 {\rm kpc}\,(1.4 R_{\rm vir})$, both of which present intriguing offsets between their gaseous and stellar distributions. Here we present hydrodynamic simulations with {\sc ramses} to reproduce the observed dynamics of Leo~T: its $80{\rm pc}$ stellar-HI offset and the 35{\rm pc} offset between its older ($\gtrsim 5{\rm Gyr}$) and younger ($\sim\!200\!-\!1000{\rm Myr}$) stellar population. We considered internal and environmental properties such as stellar winds, two HI components, cored and cuspy dark matter profiles, and different satellite orbits considering the MW circumgalactic medium. We find that the models that best match the observed morphology of the gas and stars include mild stellar winds that interact with the HI generating the observed offset, and dark matter profiles with extended cores. The latter allow long oscillations of the off-centred younger stellar component, due to long mixing timescales ($\gtrsim200 {\rm Myr}$), and the slow precession of near-closed orbits in the cored potentials; instead, cuspy and compact cored dark matter models result in the rapid mixing of the material ($\lesssim 200{\rm Myr}$). These models predict that non-equilibrium substructures, such as spatial and kinematic offsets, are likely to persist in cored low-mass dwarfs and to remain detectable on long timescales in systems with recent star formation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Dense Association of Stars in the Vicinity of the Supermassive Black Hole Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-sources), located at the distance of $6.05''$ north-east of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of $1.35''$. We present the first proper motion measurements of N-sources and find that a larger subset of N-sources (28 sources) exhibit a north-westward flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N-sources in $H$, $K_s$, and $L$' bands. The north-westward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss a tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain a significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of $\sim 10^4~M_\odot$ for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a co-moving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals towards Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N-sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.</description>

      <title>Challenges in constraining dust properties from starlight polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust polarization, which comes from the alignment of aspherical grains to magnetic fields, has been widely employed to study the interstellar medium (ISM) dust properties. The wavelength dependence of the degree of optical polarization, known as the Serkowski relation, was a key observational discovery that advanced grain modeling and alignment theories. However, it was recently shown that line-of-sight (LOS) variations in the structure of the ISM or the magnetic field morphology contaminate the constraints extracted from fits to the Serkowski relation. These cases can be identified by the wavelength-dependent variability in the polarization angles. We aim to investigate the extent to which we can constrain the intrinsic dust properties and alignment efficiency from dust polarization data, by accounting for LOS variations of the magnetic field morphology. We employed archival data to fit the Serkowski relation and constrain its free parameter. We explored potential imprints of LOS variations of the magnetic field morphology in these constraints. We found that these LOS integration effects contaminate the majority of the existing dataset, thus biasing the obtained Serkowski parameters by approximately 10%. The constancy of the polarization angles with wavelength does not necessarily guarantee the absence of 3D averaging effects. We examined the efficiency of dust grains in polarizing starlight, as probed by the ratio of the degree of polarization to dust reddening, E(B-V). We found that all measurements respect the limit established by polarized dust emission data. A suppression in polarization efficiencies occurs at E(B-V) close to 0.5 mag, which we attribute to projection effects and may be unrelated to the intrinsic alignment of dust grains.</description>

      <title>HETDEX-LOFAR Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the power of blind integral field spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) with sources detected by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to construct the HETDEX-LOFAR Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog. Starting from the first data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), including a value-added catalog with photometric redshifts, we extracted 28,705 HETDEX spectra. Using an automatic classifying algorithm, we assigned each object a star, galaxy, or quasar label along with a velocity/redshift, with supplemental classifications coming from the continuum and emission line catalogs of the internal, fourth data release from HETDEX (HDR4). We measured 9,087 new redshifts; in combination with the value-added catalog, our final spectroscopic redshift sample is 9,710 sources. This new catalog contains the highest substantial fraction of LOFAR galaxies with spectroscopic redshift information; it improves archival spectroscopic redshifts, and facilitates research to determine the [O II] emission properties of radio galaxies from $0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.5$, and the Ly$\alpha$ emission characteristics of both radio galaxies and quasars from $1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. Additionally, by combining the unique properties of LOFAR and HETDEX, we are able to measure star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses. Using the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS), we measure the emission lines of [O III], [Ne III], and [O II] and evaluate line-ratio diagnostics to determine whether the emission from these galaxies is dominated by AGN or star formation and fit a new SFR-L$_{150MHz}$ relationship.</description>

      <title>Interaction Between Rogue HI Clouds and the Magnetic Field High Above the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the Milky Way and external galaxies support the idea that large-scale magnetic fields are concentrated in galactic disks, with halo magnetic fields at least an order of magnitude weaker. However, very little is known about the transition between the two. We present the discovery of linearly polarized radio emission at the interface between interacting shells of gas within a well-known grouping of high-velocity clouds (HVCs), the Anti-Center Shell. Faraday rotation of diffuse emission and of background extragalactic compact sources demonstrates an enhancement of the field at the interface. This is the clearest observed example of an HVC altering the large-scale magnetic field at the disk-halo interface and is the first image of magnetic field effects in an HVC. These results demonstrate the possibility of future three-dimensional reconstruction of the Galactic magnetic field and showcase the versatility of the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory as one of the few existing telescopes which can exploit this new method of probing Galactic magnetism.</description>

Abstract: Context. A major challenge in astrophysics is classifying galaxies by their activity. Current methods often require multiple diagnostics to capture the full range of galactic activity. Furthermore, overlapping excitation sources with similar observational signatures complicate the analysis of a galaxy's activity. Aims. This study aims to create an activity diagnostic tool that overcomes the limitations of current emission line diagnostics by identifying the underlying excitation mechanisms in mixed-activity galaxies (e.g., star formation, active nucleus, or old stellar populations) and determining the dominant ones. Methods. We use the random forest machine-learning algorithm, trained on three main activity classes -star-forming, AGN, and passive- that represent key gas excitation mechanisms. This diagnostic employs four distinguishing features: the equivalent widths of [O iii] ${\lambda}$5007, [N ii] ${\lambda}$6584, H${\alpha}$, and the D4000 continuum break index. Results. The classifier achieves near-perfect performance, with an overall accuracy of ~ 99% and recall scores of ~ 100% for star-forming, ~ 98% for AGN, and ~ 99% for passive galaxies. These exceptional scores allow for confident decomposition of mixed activity classes into the primary gas excitation mechanisms, overcoming the limitations of current classification methods. Additionally, the classifier can be simplified to a two-dimensional diagnostic using the D4000 index and log$_{10}$(EW([O iii])$^{2}$) without significant loss of diagnostic power. Conclusions. We present a diagnostic for classifying galaxies by their primary gas excitation mechanisms and deconstructing the activity of mixed-activity galaxies into these components. This method covers the full range of galaxy activity. Aditionally, D4000 index serves as an indicator for resolving the degeneracy among various activity components.</description>

      <title>$S^5$: New insights from deep spectroscopic observations of the tidal tails of the globular clusters NGC 1261 and NGC 1904</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08991</link>

Abstract: As globular clusters (GCs) orbit the Milky Way, their stars are tidally stripped forming tidal tails that follow the orbit of the clusters around the Galaxy. The morphology of these tails is complex and shows correlations with the phase of the orbit and the orbital angular velocity, especially for GCs on eccentric orbits. Here, we focus on two GCs, NGC 1261 and NGC 1904, that have potentially been accreted alongside Gaia-Enceladus and that have shown signatures of having, in addition of tidal tails, structures formed by distributions of extra-tidal stars that are misaligned with the general direction of the clusters' respective orbits. To provide an explanation for the formation of these structures, we make use of spectroscopic measurements from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$) as well as proper motion measurements from Gaia's third data release (DR3), and apply a Bayesian mixture modeling approach to isolate high-probability member stars. We recover extra-tidal features similar to those found in Shipp et al. (2018) surrounding each cluster. We conduct N-body simulations and compare the expected distribution and variation in the dynamical parameters along the orbit with those of our potential member sample. Furthermore, we use Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry to inspect the distribution of the member stars in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). We find that the potential members agree reasonably with the N-body simulations and that the majority of them follow a simple stellar population-like distribution in the CMD which is characteristic of GCs. In the case of NGC 1904, we clearly detect the tidal debris escaping the inner and outer Lagrange points which are expected to be prominent when at or close to the apocenter of its orbit. Our analysis allows for further exploration of other GCs in the Milky Way that exhibit similar extra-tidal features.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL Survey: Complex kinematics of the galaxies at the end of the Reionization Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The history of gas assembly in early galaxies is reflected in their complex kinematics. While a considerable fraction of galaxies at z~5 are consistent with rotating disks, current studies indicate that the dominant galaxy assembly mechanism corresponds to mergers. Despite the important progress, the dynamical classification of galaxies at these epochs is still limited by observations' resolution. We present a detailed morphological and kinematic analysis of the far-infrared bright main sequence galaxy HZ10 at z=5.65, making use of new high-resolution ($\lesssim0.3$") [CII] 158$\mu$m ALMA and rest-frame optical JWST/NIRSpec observations. These observations reveal a previously unresolved complex morphology and kinematics of the HZ10. We confirm that HZ10 is not a single galaxy but consists of at least three components in close projected separation along the east-to-west direction. We find a [CII] bright central component (C), separated by 1.5 and 4 kpc from the east (E) and west (W) components, respectively. Our [CII] observations resolve the HZ10-C component resulting in a velocity gradient, produced by either rotation or a close-in merger. We test the rotating disk possibility using DysmalPy kinematic modeling and propose three dynamical scenarios for the HZ10 system: (i) a double merger, in which the companion galaxy HZ10-W merges with the disturbed clumpy rotation disk formed by the HZ10-C and E components; (ii) a triple merger, where the companion galaxies, HZ10-W and HZ10-E, merge with the rotation disk HZ10-C; and (iii) a quadruple merger, in which the companion galaxies HZ10-W and HZ10-E merge with the close double merger HZ10-C. Comparing [CII] with JWST/NIRSpec data, we find that [CII] emission closely resembles the broad [OIII] 5007{\AA} emission. The latter reflects the interacting nature of the system and suggests that ionized and neutral gas phases in HZ10 are well mixed.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation from non-evaporating primordial black holes cannot enable the formation of direct collapse black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe is a subject of significant debate. In this study, we examine whether non-evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) can offer a solution. We establish initial constraints on the range of PBH masses that correspond to Hawking radiation (HR) effective temperatures in the range needed to avoid the fragmentation of primordial gas into smaller, stellar-mass black holes. We also investigate the specific intensity of the HR from non-evaporating PBHs and compare it with the critical radiation needed for direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). We show that HR from non-evaporating PBHs cannot serve as the heating mechanism to facilitate the formation of the seeds for the SMBHs we observe in the high-redshift Universe unless, perhaps, the PBHs within the relevant mass range comprise a significant fraction of dark matter and are significantly clustered towards the center of the primordial halo.</description>

      <title>Detection of an orthogonal alignment between parsec scale AGN jets and their host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is an area of active research. One way to investigate this is to compare parsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs with the projected shape of their kiloparsec-scale host galaxies. We analyse Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and optical images of their host galaxies. We compare the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio sources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large optical surveys. In total 6273 galaxy-AGN pairs were found. We carefully account for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys data (DESI LS) is significantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS, with which 5853 galaxy-AGN pairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (with a p-value $\leqslant$ 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kpc projected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties are connected over 3 orders of magnitude in scale. This points towards an intimate connection between the SMBH, their host galaxies and their subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Chemical pathways of SO2 with hydrogen atoms on interstellar ice analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a sulfur-containing molecule expected to exist as a solid in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we performed laboratory experiments and computational analyses on the surface reactions of solid SO2 with hydrogen atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) at low temperatures. After 40 min of exposure of SO2 deposited on ASW to H atoms, approximately 80% of the solid SO2 was lost from the substrate at 10-40 K, and approximately 50% even at 60 K, without any definite detection of reaction products. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that H atoms preferentially add to the S atom of solid SO2, forming the HSO2 radical. Further reactions of the HSO2 radical with H atoms result in the formation of several S-bearing species, including HS(O)OH, the S(O)OH radical, HO-S-OH, HS-OH, and H2S. In codeposition experiments involving H and SO2, we confirmed the formation of H2S, HS(O)OH, and/or HO-S-OH. However, the yields of these S-bearing species were insufficient to account for the complete loss of the initial SO2 reactant. These findings suggest that some products desorbed into the gas phase upon formation. This study indicates that a portion of SO2 in ice mantles may remain unreacted, avoiding hydrogenation, while the remainder is converted into other species, some of which may be subject to chemical desorption.</description>

      <title>Mapping the dense molecular gas towards thirteen supernova remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) can exert strong influence on molecular clouds (MCs) through interaction by shock wave and cosmic rays. In this paper, we present our mapping observation of HCO+ and HCN 1-0 lines towards 13 SNRs interacting with MCs, together with archival data of CO isotopes. Strong HCO+ emission is found in the fields of view (FOVs) of SNRs W30, G9.7-0.0, Kes 69, 3C 391, 3C 396, W51C, HC 40, and CTB109 in the local-standard-of-rest (LSR) velocity intervals in which they are suggested to show evidence of SNR-MC interaction. We find an incomplete 12CO shell surrounding G9.7-0.0 with an expanding motion. This shell may be driven by the stellar wind of the SNR progenitor. We also find an arc of 12CO gas spatially coincident with the northwestern radio shell of Kes 69. As for the HCO+ line emission, SNRs 3C 391 and W51C exhibit significant line profile broadening indicative of shock perturbation, and CTB109 exhibits a possible blue-shifted line wing brought by shock interaction. We do not find significant variation of the I(HCO+)/I(HCN) line ratio between broad-line and narrow-line regions, among different SNRs, and between MCs associated with SNRs and typical Galactic MCs. Therefore, we caution on using the I(HCO+)/I(HCN) line ratio as a diagnostic of SNR feedback and CR ionization. We also estimate the N(HCO+)/N(CO) abundance ratio in 11 regions towards the observed SNRs, but they show little difference from the typical values in quiescent MCs, possibly because N(HCO+)/N(CO) is not an effective tracer of CR ionization.</description>

      <title>On the Average Ultraviolet Emission Line Spectra of High-Redshift Galaxies: Hot and Cold, Carbon-poor, Nitrogen-modest, and Oozing Ionizing Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Galactic Structure using Time Domain Gravitational Wave Signal from Double White Dwarfs Detected by Space Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gravitation Wave (GW) signals from a large number of double white dwarfs (DWDs) in the Galaxy are expected to be detected by space GW detectors, e.g., the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and Tianqin in the millihertz band. In this paper, we present an alternative method by directly using the time-domain GW signal detected by space GW detectors to constrain the anisotropic structure of the Galaxy. The information of anisotropic distribution of DWDs is naturally encoded in the time-domain GW signal because of the variation of the detectors' directions and consequently the pattern functions due to their annual motion around the sun. The direct use of the time-domain GW signal enables simple calculations, such as utilizing an analytical method to assess the noise arising from the superposition of random phases of DWDs and using appropriate weights to improve the constraints. We investigate the possible constraints on the scale of the Galactic thin disk and bulge that may be obtained from LISA and Taiji by using this method with mock signals obtained from population synthesis models. We further show the different constraining capabilities of the low-frequency signal (foreground) and the high-frequency signal (resolvable-sources) via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and find that the scale height and length of the Galactic thin disk and the scale radius of bulge can be constrained to a fractional accuracy of ~ 30%, 30%, 40% (or 20%, 10%, 40%) by using the low-frequency (or high-frequency) signal detected by LISA or Taiji.</description>

      <title>A search for HI absorption in distant star-forming galaxies with ASKAP-FLASH - I. Selection and analysis of the radio sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and discuss two catalogues of UV-selected (NUV $&lt; 22.8$ mag) galaxies that lie within a 200 deg$^2$ area of sky covered by the ASKAP FLASH survey and have an impact parameter of less than 20 arcsec to a FLASH radio continuum source. These catalogues are designed to enable a future search for 21 cm HI absorption in and around star-forming galaxies at redshift $0.4&lt;z&lt;1$. We outline the production of this UV-bright dataset, which has optical spectroscopy from the WiggleZ and SDSS surveys and a median redshift of $\sim0.6$. Analysis of the optical spectra, using multiple diagnostic diagrams, shows that galaxies with an impact parameter of less than 5 arcsec are likely to be physically associated with the radio source and are five times more likely to be an AGN than objects without a radio match. Conversely, objects with impact factors between 5 and 20 arcsec are largely (&gt;80 percent) star-forming and resemble the overall WiggleZ population. The ($g - i$) colour evolution with redshift is consistent with a history of active star-formation, but the radio-associated objects are typically redder and have colours similar to high-excitation radio galaxies. The redshift distribution of the two catalogues matches the overall distribution for WiggleZ galaxies, despite their otherwise rare radio properties. These catalogues can be expanded in future as new radio data become available, and a forthcoming paper will present the HI absorption results.</description>

      <title>COSMOS2020: Disentangling the Role of Mass and Environment in Star Formation Activity of Galaxies at $0.4&lt;z&lt;4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of internal and environmental factors in the star formation activity of galaxies is still a matter of debate, particularly at higher redshifts. Leveraging the most recent release of the COSMOS catalog, COSMOS2020, and density measurements from our previous study we disentangle the impact of environment and stellar mass on the star formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR (sSFR) of a sample of $\sim 210,000$ galaxies within redshift range $0.4&lt; z &lt; 4$ and present our findings in three cosmic epochs: 1) out to $z\sim 1$, the average SFR and sSFR decline at extremely dense environments and high mass end of the distribution which is mostly due to the presence of the massive quiescent population; 2) at $1&lt;z&lt;2$, the environmental dependence diminishes, while mass is still the dominant factor in star formation activity; 3) beyond $z\sim 2$, our sample is dominated by star-forming galaxies and we observe a reversal of the trends seen in the local universe: the average SFR increases with increasing environmental density. Our analysis shows that both environmental and mass quenching efficiencies increase with stellar mass at all redshifts, with mass being the dominant quenching factor in massive galaxies compared to environmental effects. At $2&lt;z&lt;4$, negative values of environmental quenching efficiency suggest that the fraction of star-forming galaxies in dense environments exceeds that in less dense regions, likely due to the greater availability of cold gas, higher merger rates, and tidal effects that trigger star formation activity.</description>

Abstract: The VLT Survey Telescope Survey of Mass Assembly and Structural Hierarchy (VST-SMASH) aims to detect tidal features and remnants around very nearby galaxies, a unique and essential diagnostic of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation. Leveraging optimal sky conditions at ESO's Paranal Observatory, combined with the VST's multi-band optical filters, VST-SMASH aims to be the definitive survey of stellar streams and tidal remnants in the Local Volume, targeting a low surface-brightness limit of $\mu \sim$ 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the g and r bands, and $\mu \sim$ 28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the i band, in a volume-limited sample of local galaxies within 11 Mpc and the Euclid footprint.</description>

      <title>X-ray reverberation modelling of the continuum, optical/UV time-lags in quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Extensive, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of nearby and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown that the UV/optical variations are well correlated with time delays which increase with increasing wavelength. Such behaviour is expected in the context of the X-ray thermal reverberation of the accretion disc in AGN. Aims: Our main objective is to use time-lag measurements of luminous AGN and fit them with sophisticated X-ray reverberation time-lags models. In this way we can investigate whether X-ray reverberation can indeed explain the observed continuum time lags, and whether time-lag measurements can be used to measure physical parameters such as the X-ray corona height and the spin of the black hole (BH) in these systems. Methods: We use archival time-lag measurements for quasars from different surveys, and we compute their rest frame, mean time-lags spectrum. We fit the data with analytical X-ray reverberation models, using $\chi^2$ statistics, and fitting for both maximal and non spinning BHs, for various colour correction values and X-ray corona heights. Results: We found that X-ray reverberation can explain very well the observed time lags, assuming the measured BH mass, accretion rate and X-ray luminosity of the quasars in the sample. The model agrees well with the data both for non-rotating and maximally rotating BHs, as long as the corona height is larger than $\sim 40$ gravitational radii. This is in agreement with previous results which showed that X-ray reverberation can also explain the disc radius in micro-lensed quasars, for the same corona heights. The corona height we measure depends on the model assumption of a perfectly flat disc. More realistic disc models may result in lower heights for the X-ray corona.</description>

      <title>Evaluating cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with spectral variance in the optical window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide valuable insights on galaxy evolution when coupled with observational data. Comparisons with real galaxies are typically performed via scaling relations of model fitting. Here we follow an alternative approach based on the spectral variance in a model-independent way. We build upon the work presented in Sharbaf et al. (2023) that studied the covariance of high quality SDSS continuum-subtracted spectra in a relatively narrow range of velocity dispersion (100-150 km/s). Here the same analysis is applied to synthetic data from the EAGLE and Illustris TNG100 simulations, to assess the ability of these runs to mimic real galaxies. The real and simulated spectra are consistent regarding spectral variance, although with subtle differences that can inform the implementation of subgrid physics. Spectral fitting done a posteriori on stacks segregated with respect to latent space reveals that the first principal component (PC1) is predominantly influenced by the stellar age distribution, with an underlying age-metallicity degeneracy. Good agreement is found regarding star formation prescriptions but there is disagreement with AGN feedback, that also affects the subset of quiescent galaxies. We show a substantial difference in the implementation of the AGN subgrid, regarding central black hole seeding, that could lead to the mismatch. Differences are manifest between these two simulations in the star formation histories stacked with respect to latent space. We emphasise that this methodology only relies on the spectral variance to assess whether simulations provide a true representation of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>A complete Herbig disk mass survey in Orion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disks around intermediate mass stars called Herbig disks are the formation sites of giant exoplanets. Obtaining a complete inventory of these disks will therefore give insights into giant planet formation. However, until now no complete disk survey has been done on Herbig disks in a single star-forming region. Orion is the only nearby region with a significant number of Herbig disks (N=35) to carry out such a survey. Using new NOEMA observations of 25 Herbig disks, in combination with ALMA archival data of 10 Herbig disks, results in a complete sample of all know Herbig disks in Orion. Using uv-plane analysis for the NOEMA observed disks, and literature values of the ALMA observed disks, we obtain the dust masses of all Herbig disks and obtain a cumulative dust mass distribution. Additionally, six disks with new CO isotopologues detections are presented, one of which is detected in C17O. We calculate the external ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on each disk and compare the dust mass to it. We find a median disk dust mass of 11.7 M_\oplus for the Herbig disks. Comparing the Herbig disks in Orion to previous surveys for mainly T Tauri disks in Orion, we find that while ~50% of the Herbig disks have a mass higher than 10 M_\oplus, this is at most 25% for the T~Tauri disks. This difference is especially striking when considering that the Herbig disks are around a factor of two older than the T Tauri disks. Comparing to the Herbig disks observed with ALMA from a previous study, no significant difference is found between the distributions. We find a steeper (slope of -7.6) relationship between the dust mass and external UV irradation compared to that of the T~Tauri disks (slope of -1.3). This work shows the importance of complete samples, giving rise to the need of a complete survey of the Herbig disk population.</description>

      <title>KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412: Three microlensing events involving two lens masses and two source stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carried out a project involving the systematic analysis of microlensing data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network survey. The aim of this project is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are difficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly complex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be adequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S model can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By incorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a comprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features. Bayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables, indicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary systems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an early K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge, whereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In all events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a detection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary source star, which increases detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Interstellar Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio events with millisecond-scale durations, and debated origins. Collisions between planetesimals and neutron stars have been proposed as a mechanism to produce FRBs; the planetesimal strength, size and density determine the time duration and energy of the resulting event. One source of planetesimals is the population of interstellar objects (ISOs), free-floating objects expected to be extremely abundant in galaxies across the Universe as products of planetary formation. We explore using the ISO population as a reservoir of planetesimals for FRB production, finding that the expected ISO-neutron star collision rate is comparable with the observed FRB event rate. Using a model linking the properties of planetesimals and the FRBs they produce, we further show that observed FRB durations are consistent with the sizes of known ISOs, and the FRB energy distribution is consistent with the observed size distributions of Solar System planetesimal populations. Finally, we argue that the rate of ISO-neutron star collisions must increase with cosmic time, matching the observed evolution of the FRB rate. Thus, ISO-neutron star collisions are a feasible mechanism for producing FRBs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Large-Scale Anisotropies on Galaxy Clustering and Cosmological Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically assess the impact of significant dipole and large-scale anisotropies on galaxy clustering signals, with a focus on radio continuum surveys. Our study reveals that these anisotropies -- resulting from intrinsic cosmological effects and/or observational systematics -- profoundly influence the two-point correlation function (2PCF) and angular power spectrum ($C_\ell$). Notably, large-scale anisotropies can obscure or simulate non-Gaussianity signals, complicating the extraction of precise cosmological information. The results emphasize that it is crucial to address systematics and rigorously mask the dipole and its surrounding multipoles to obtain accurate cosmological constraints. This approach is essential for extracting cosmological results from clustering signals, particularly for future surveys such as SKA, DESI, and LSST, to ensure the precision and reliability of cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of $f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10}$ at 90\% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically $f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}$. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least $\sim$$10\%$ of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.</description>

      <title>A Recent Supermassive Black Hole Binary in the Galactic Center Unveiled by the Hypervelocity Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dozens of B-type hypervelocity stars (HVSs) moving faster than the Galactic escape speed have been discovered in the Galactic halo and are produced most likely by the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC). However, the velocity distribution and in particular the deficit of the HVSs above 700 km/s is seriously inconsistent with the expectations of the present models. Here we show that the high-velocity deficit is due to the deficiency in close interactions of stars with the SMBH, because an orbiting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of about 15,000 Solar mass kicked away slowly approaching stars 50-250 million years ago. The SMBH-IMBH binary formed probably after the merger of the Galaxy with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy, and coalesced about 10 million years ago. Afterwards, HVSs with speed up to above 3000 km/s are produced by binary tidal disruptions and the counterparts formed the S-star cluster at the GC.</description>

      <title>Two-temperature treatments in magnetically arrested disk GRMHD simulations more accurately predict light curves of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sgr A* and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The two most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, these and nearly all MAD models exhibit greater light-curve variability at 230 GHz compared to historical observations. Moreover, no model successfully passes all the variability and multiwavelength constraints. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*, where the temperatures of both species are evolved more self-consistently. We include Coulomb coupling, radiative cooling of electrons, and model heating via magnetic reconnection. We find that the light-curve variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment and variable adiabatic indices, compared to 1T simulations. Contrary to the common assumption of neglecting radiative cooling for the low accretion rates of Sgr A*, we also find that radiative cooling still affects the accretion flow, reducing the electron temperature in the inner disk by about 10%, which in turn lowers both the average flux and variability at 230 GHz by roughly 10%.</description>

      <title>Violent starbursts and quiescence induced by FUV radiation feedback in metal-poor galaxies at high-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim 8$ suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at sub-pc resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., $\mathrm{H_2}$ dissociating radiation) from Pop II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous, but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm ($\sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$) until they reach a relatively high density ($\gtrsim 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder ($\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We, therefore, observe exceptionally bright galaxies (ten times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched "dead" galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myrs.</description>

      <title>Charting the main sequence of star-forming galaxies out to redshifts z&lt;5.7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new determination of the star-forming main sequence (MS), obtained through stacking 100k K-band-selected galaxies in the far-infrared (FIR) Herschel and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) imaging. By fitting the dust emission curve to the stacked FIR photometry, we derive the IR luminosities (LIR), and hence the star formation rates (SFRs) out to z&lt;5.7. The functional form of the MS is found, with the linear SFR-M* relation that flattens at high stellar masses and the normalization that increases exponentially with redshift. We derive the corresponding redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and compare our findings with the recent literature. We find our MS to be exhibiting slightly lower normalization at z&lt;2 and to flatten at somewhat larger stellar masses at high redshifts. By deriving the relationship between the peak dust temperature (Td) and redshift, where Td increases linearly from ~20 K at z=0.5 to ~50 K at z=5, we conclude that the apparent inconsistencies in the shapes of the MS are most likely caused by the different dust temperatures assumed when deriving SFRs in the absence of FIR data. Finally, we investigate the derived shape of the star-forming MS by simulating the time evolution of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF). While the simulated GSMF is in good agreement with the observed one, some inconsistencies persist. In particular, we find the simulated GSMF to be slightly overpredicting the number density of low-mass galaxies at z&gt;2.</description>

Abstract: The metal content of galaxies is a direct probe of the baryon cycle. A hallmark example is the relationship between a galaxy's stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas-phase metallicity: the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR). While low-redshift ($z\lesssim4$) observational studies suggest that the FMR is redshift-invariant, recent high-$z$ JWST data indicate deviations from the FMR established at low-$z$. In this study, we utilize the FMR to predict the evolution of the normalisation of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) using the cosmological simulations Illustris, IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA. Our findings demonstrate that a $z = 0$ calibrated FMR struggles to predict the evolution in the MZR of each simulation. To quantify the divergence of the predictions, we introduce the concepts of a ``static'' FMR, where the role of the SFR in setting the normalization of the MZR does not change with redshift, and a ``dynamic'' FMR, where the role of SFR evolves over time. We find static FMRs in SIMBA and dynamic FMRs in Illustris, IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. We suggest that the differences between these models likely points to the subtle differences in the implementation of the baryon cycle. Moreover, we echo recent JWST results at $z &gt; 4$ by finding significant offsets from the FMR in IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, suggesting that the observed FMR may have a similar dynamic trend as these simulations. Overall, our findings imply that the current FMR framework neglects important time variations of these simulations' baryon cycles.</description>

      <title>Expansion Kinematics of Young Clusters. I. Lambda Ori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Most stars form in clusters or associations but only a small number of these groups are expected to remain bound for longer than a few Myr. Once star formation has ended and the molecular gas around young stellar objects has been expelled via feedback processes, most initially bound young clusters lose the majority of their binding mass and begin to disperse into the Galactic field. Aims. This process can be investigated by analysing the structure and kinematic trends in nearby young clusters, particularly expansion, the tell-tale sign that a cluster is no longer gravitationally bound but is dispersing into the field. Methods. We combine Gaia DR3 5-parameter astrometry with calibrated radial velocities for members of the nearby young cluster Lambda Ori (Collinder 69). Results. We characterise the plane-of-sky substructure of the cluster using the Q-parameter and Angular Dispersion parameter. We find evidence that the cluster contains significant substructure, but that this is preferentially located away from the central cluster core, which is smooth and likely remains bound. We find strong evidence for expansion in Lambda Ori in the plane-of-sky using a number of metrics, but also that the trends are asymmetric at the 5$\sigma$ significance level. with the maximum rate of expansion being directed nearly parallel to the Galactic plane. We then invert the maximum rate of expansion of $0.144^{+0.003}_{-0.003} kms^{-1}pc^{-1}$ to give an expansion timescale of $6.944^{+0.148}_{-0.142} Myr$, which is slightly larger than typical literature age estimates for the cluster. We also find asymmetry in the velocity dispersion, potential signatures of cluster rotation, and calculate kinematic ages for individual cluster members by tracing their motion back in time to their closest approach to the cluster center.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way's rowdy neighbours: The effects of the Large Magellanic Cloud and Sagittarius Dwarf on the Milky Way Disc</title>

Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) is a barred spiral galaxy shaped by tidal interactions with its satellites. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy (Sgr) are the dominant influences at the present day. This paper presents a suite of four 10^9 particle N-body simulations, illustrating the response of the stellar disc of the MW to the close approach of the LMC and the merger of Sgr into the MW. The suite is intended to provide a resource for others to study the complex interactions between the MW and its satellites independently and together, in comparison to an isolated disc control simulation. The high temporal and mass resolution allows for a quantitative Fourier decomposition of the stellar kinematics, disentangling the individual influence of each satellite on the MW. In our preliminary analysis, we find that the influences from the LMC and Sgr on the disc of the MW appear distinct, additive, and separable within our tailored simulations. Notably, the corrugations induced by Sgr reproduce the large radial velocity wave seen in the data (Eilers et al. 2020). Overall, our findings emphasise the need to include both satellites when modelling the present-day state of the MW structure and kinematics</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) IX: The enriched circumgalactic and intergalactic medium around star-forming field dwarf galaxies traced by O VI absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shallow potential wells of star-forming dwarf galaxies make their surrounding circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM) sensitive laboratories for studying the inflows and outflows thought to regulate galaxy evolution. We present new absorption-line measurements in quasar sightlines probing within projected distances of $&lt;300$ kpc from 91 star-forming field dwarf galaxies with a median stellar mass of $\log{M_\star/\rm{M_\odot}} \approx 8.3$ at $0.077 &lt; z &lt; 0.73$ from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). In this redshift range, the CUBS quasar spectra cover a suite of transitions including H I, low and intermediate metal ions (e.g., C II, Si II, C III, and Si III), and highly ionized O VI. This CUBS-Dwarfs survey enables constraints with samples 9$\times$ larger than past dwarf CGM/IGM studies with similar ionic coverage. We find that low and intermediate ionization metal absorption is rare around dwarf galaxies, consistent with previous surveys of local dwarfs. In contrast, highly ionized O VI is commonly observed in sightlines that pass within the virial radius of a dwarf, and O VI detection rates are non-negligible at projected distances of 1$-$2$\times$ the virial radius. Based on these measurements, we estimate that the O VI-bearing phase of the CGM/IGM accounts for a dominant share of the metal budget of dwarf galaxies. The absorption kinematics suggest that a relatively modest fraction of the O VI-bearing gas is formally unbound. Together, these results imply that low-mass systems at $z\lesssim 1$ effectively retain a substantial fraction of their metals within the nearby CGM and IGM.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Shear on Disk Galaxy Star Formation Rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the physical processes that control galactic-scale star formation rates is essential for an improved understanding of galaxy evolution. The role of orbital shear is currently unclear, with some models expecting reduced star formation rates (SFRs) and efficiencies (SFEs) with increasing shear, e.g., if shear stabilizes gas against gravitational collapse, while others predicting enhanced rates, e.g., if shear-driven collisions between giant molecular clouds (GMCs) trigger star formation. Expanding on the analysis of 16 galaxies by Suwannajak, Tan, \&amp; Leroy (2014), we assess the shear dependence of SFE per orbital time ($\epsilon_\mathrm{orb}$) in 49 galaxies selected from the PHANGS-ALMA survey. In particular, we test a prediction of the shear-driven GMC collision model that $\epsilon_\mathrm{orb}\propto(1-0.7\beta)$, where $\beta\equiv{d}\:\mathrm{ln}\:v_\mathrm{circ}/d\:\mathrm{ln}\:r$, i.e., SFE per orbital time declines with decreasing shear. We fit the function $\epsilon_\mathrm{orb}=\epsilon_\mathrm{orb,\,0}(1-\alpha_\mathrm{CC}\beta)$ finding $\alpha_\mathrm{CC}\simeq0.76\pm0.16$; an alternative fit with $\epsilon_\mathrm{orb}$ normalized by the median value in each galaxy yields $\alpha_\mathrm{CC}^*=0.80\pm0.15$. These results are in good agreement with the prediction of the shear-driven GMC collision theory. We also examine the impact of a galactic bar on $\epsilon_\mathrm{orb}$ finding a modest decrease in SFE in the presence of bar, which can be attributed to lower rates of shear in these regions. We discuss the implications of our results for the GMC life cycle and environmental dependence of star formation activity.</description>

      <title>Reverberation Mapping of Lamp-post and Wind Structures in Accretion Thin Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the discrepancy where disk sizes exceed those predicted by standard models, we explore two extensions to disk size estimates within the UV/optical wavelength range: disk winds and color correction. We provide detailed, self-consistent derivations and analytical formulas, including those based on a power-law temperature approximation, offering efficient tools for analyzing observational data. Applying our model to four type I AGNs with intensive reverberation mapping observations, we find a shallower temperature slope ($T\propto R^{-0.66}$, compared to $R^{-3/4}$ traditionally) and a color correction factor ($f_{\rm col} \approx 1.6$), consistent with previous studies. We observe a positive correlation between accretion rate and color correction with black hole mass. However, the small sample size limits our conclusions. The strong degeneracy between the temperature slope and accretion rate suggests that incorporating flux spectra or spectral energy distributions could improve fitting accuracy. Our simulation approach rapidly generates quasar light curves while accommodating various observational scenarios for reverberation mapping, making it well-suited for training machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Origin of the Vertical Metallicity Gradient of the Milky Way Bulge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertical metallicity gradient in the Milky Way bulge is well-established. Yet, its origin has not been fully understood under the Galactic secular evolution scenario. We construct single-disk and triple-disk $N$-body models with an initial radial metallicity gradient for each disk. These models generate a vertical metallicity gradient through a ``two-step heating" mechanism: first the outer, metal-poor particles move inward via the bar instability and subsequently undergo more significant vertical heating during the buckling instability, so they end up at greater vertical height. The ``two-step heating" mechanism nearly linearly transforms the radial metallicity gradients in precursor disks into vertical metallicity gradients. Comparing the models with a triple-disk model tagged with radially independent Gaussian metallicity, we find that, despite certain limitations, the ``two-step heating" mechanism is still important in shaping the Galactic vertical metallicity gradient. If the bar and buckling instabilities contributed to the formation of boxy/peanut-shaped bulges, then the ``two-step heating" mechanism is inevitable in the secular evolution of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge.</description>

      <title>Boosting the evolutionary picture of Cl 0024+17 and MS 0451-03: A case study at intermediate-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we improve the dynamic-evolutionary framework of two massive clusters at intermediate redshifts: Cl 0024+17 at $z \sim 0.4$ and MS 0451-03 at $z \sim 0.5$. The spectroscopic galaxy members were selected from Moran et al. (2007a), which combine optical and UV imaging with spectroscopy. Using a set of dynamic estimators with different approaches, our results show that both Cl 0024+17 and MS 0451-03 are non-relaxed systems with distinct dynamical configurations. Cl 0024+17 exhibits a disturbed kinematics, displaying significant gaps and a velocity dispersion profile suggesting a merger. This is confirmed by the presence of previously reported substructures and new ones identified in this study. MS 0451-03 appears less disturbed than Cl 0024+17, indicating by the significant segregation between late and early-type galaxies, with the latter occupying more central regions of the projected phase-space. However, five previously unobserved substructures and non-Gaussianity in the velocity distribution indicate that MS 0451-03 is also out of equilibrium. In both clusters, there are substructures infalling onto the systems, indicating key moments in their assembly histories and potential effects on the pre-processing of galaxies within these subgroups. This is suggested by the high percentage of early-type galaxies outside $R_{200}$ (approximately $83\%$) in the case of CL 0024+17. This work reinforces the importance of more detailed dynamical analysis of clusters to better characterize their evolutionary picture.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Xu &amp; Jing (2022) reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass $M_h$ and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the S\'ersic index $n$, at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of $11.3 &lt; \log M_*/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 11.7$, using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on $n$, we confirm a positive correlation between $n$ and $M_h$, and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of $n$ and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between $M_h$ and $n$. Furthermore, disabling jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback in SIMBA simulations results in the disappearance of the positive $n-M_h$ relationship, suggesting that the star formation history influenced by black holes may be a contributing factor.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of Thorne-\.Zytkow objects: Rejuvenated donors and unexplored progenitors in the common envelope formation channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Common envelope evolution of a massive star and a neutron star companion has two possible outcomes: formation of a short-period binary (a potential gravitational wave source progenitor) or a merger of the massive star with the neutron star. If the binary merges, a structure with a neutron star core surrounded by a large diffuse envelope, a so-called Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO), may form. The predicted appearance of this hypothetical class of star is very similar to red supergiants, making observational identification difficult.
  Aims. Our objective is to understand the properties of systems that are potential T\.ZO progenitors, e.g., binary systems that enter a common envelope phase with a neutron star companion. We also aim to distinguish those that have been through a previous stable mass transfer phase, which can rejuvenate the accretor. We estimate the number of T\.ZOs in the Milky Way and assess the impact of uncertainties in their formation.
  Methods. We use the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS at Solar metallicity and with common envelope efficiency parameter set to unity to determine the population demographics of T\.ZOs. We use one-dimensional evolutionary T\.ZO models from the literature to determine a fit for T\.ZO lifetime in order to estimate the current number of T\.ZOs in the Galaxy as well as to assess core disruption during the merger.
  Results. We explore the progenitors in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, calculate formation rates, and investigate kinematics of the progenitor stars. We find that the vast majority ($\approx 92\%$) of T\.ZO progenitors in our population have experienced mass transfer and become rejuvenated before their formation event. Using a constant star formation rate we estimate $\approx 2\times 10 ^{-4}$ T\.ZOs per $M_\odot$ in our Galaxy, corresponding to $\approx 5\pm 1$ T\.ZOs in the Milky Way at present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern telescopes generate catalogs of millions of objects with the potential for new scientific discoveries, but this is beyond what can be examined visually. Here we introduce Astronomaly: Protege, an extension of the general purpose machine learning-based active anomaly detection framework Astronomaly. Protege is designed to provide well-selected recommendations for visual inspection, based on a small amount of optimized human labeling. The resulting sample contains rare or unusual sources which are simultaneously as diverse as the human trainer chooses, and of scientific interest to them. We train Protege on images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey, leveraging the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to find a low-dimensional representation of the radio galaxy cutouts. By operating in this feature space, Protege is able to recommend interesting sources with completely different morphologies in image space to those it has been trained on. This provides important advantages over similarity searches, which can only find more examples of known sources, or blind anomaly detection, which selects unusual, but not necessarily scientifically interesting sources. Using an evaluation subset, we show that, with minimal training, Protege provides excellent recommendations and find that it is even able to recommend sources that the authors missed. We briefly highlight some of Protege's top recommendations, which include X- and circular-shaped sources, filamentary structures and one-sided structures. These results illustrate the power of an optimized human-machine collaboration such as Protege to make unexpected discoveries in samples beyond human-accessible scales.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>
