      <title>Controlled Shifts of X-ray Emission Lines Measured with Transition Edge Sensors at the Advanced Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of shifts in the energy of X-ray emission lines is important for understanding the electronic structure and physical properties of materials. In this study, we demonstrate a method using a synchrotron source to introduce controlled eV-scale shifts of a narrow line in between fixed-energy fluorescence lines. We use this to characterize the ability of a hard X-ray superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) array to measure line shifts. Fixed fluorescence lines excited by higher harmonics of the monochromatic X-ray beam are used for online energy calibration, while elastic scattering from the primary harmonic acts as the variable energy emission line under study. We use this method to demonstrate the ability to track shifts in the energy of the elastic scattering line of magnitude smaller than the TES energy resolution, and find we are ultimately limited by our calibration procedure. The method can be applied over a wide X-ray energy range and provides a robust approach for the characterization of the ability of high-resolution detectors to detect X-ray emission line shifts, and the quantitative comparison of energy calibration procedures.</description>

      <title>Usage of GPUs for online and offline Reconstruction in ALICE in Run 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALICE records Pb-Pb collisions in Run 3 at an unprecedented rate of 50 kHz, storing all data in continuous readout (triggerless) mode. The main purpose of the ALICE online computing farm is the calibration of the detectors and the compression of the recorded data. The detector with the largest data volume by far is the TPC, and the online farm is thus optimized for fast and efficient processing of TPC data during data taking. For this, ALICE leverages heavily the compute power of GPUs. When there is no beam in the LHC, the GPU-equipped farm performs the offline reconstruction of the recorded data, in addition to the GRID. Since the majority of the compute capacity of the farm is in the GPUs, and meanwhile also some GRID sites begin to offer GPU resources, ALICE has started to offload other parts of the offline reconstruction to GPUs as well. The talk will present the experience and processing performance with GPUs in the Run 3 Pb-Pb and pp online and offline processing in ALICE.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic SiPMs for the Optical Readout of DarkSide-20k</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) have gained significant traction as an alternative technology to the well-established photomultiplier tube (PMT), with numerous high-sensitivity experiments adopting them either complementarily or as a replacement for PMTs. SiPMs are an ideal match for low-background cryogenic applications, such as massive noble liquid experiments for dark matter direct detection, due to (i) the significant reduction of dark noise in cold environments, (ii) relatively low radioactive content, and (iii) scalable industrial production. For these reasons, the Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration has committed to this technology for DarkSide-20k, its next experiment for the direct search of WIMP Dark Matter, currently in construction at LNGS Hall C. The development of a large-area cryogenic SiPM-based photon counter has culminated in the Photon Detector Unit (PDU), a compact photosensor measuring $20\times20$ cm$^2$ with $100$ cm$^2$ active surface per channel, based on SiPM technology from Fondazione Bruno Kessler and incorporating custom front-end electronics suited for cryogenics. More than 600 PDUs are being produced and tested in various collaboration facilities to construct the two $~10.5$ m$^2$ optical planes of the massive two-phase argon time projection chamber of DarkSide-20k and the optical readout of its veto system.</description>

      <title>A unified model of feed rotation in radio telescopes and GNSS antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a model that accounts for the phase rotation that occurs when a receiver or transmitter changes orientation while observing or emitting circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. This model extends work detailing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) carrier phase wind-up to allow us to describe the interaction of changing satellite orientation with phase rotation in observing radio telescopes. This development is motivated by, and a critical requirement of, unifying GNSS and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements at the observation level. The model can be used for either stationary choke ring antennas or steerable radio telescopes observing either natural radio sources or satellites. Simulations and experimental data are used to validate the model and to illustrate its importance. In addition, we rigorously lay out the feed rotation correction for radio telescopes with beam waveguide and full Nasmyth focuses and validate the correction by observing the effect with dual polarization observations. Using this feed rotation model for beam waveguide telescopes, we produce the first phase delay solution for the VLBI baseline WARK30M-WARK12M. We provide a practical guide to using the feed rotation model in Appendix D.</description>

      <title>RF phase effect in the ion-guide laser ion source (IG-LIS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the phase between the radio frequency (RF) waveform driving the ion guide and the laser pulses generating ions on the intensity of the transmitted ion beam has been studied. Experiments were conducted at TRIUMF's offline laser ion source test stand (LIS-stand) and online at the isotope separator and accelerator (ISAC) facility for radioactive ion beam delivery. In this study, a master clock is used to synchronize the laser trigger for laser ionization and the RF waveform generator driving the ion guide, so that laser ionization within the ionization volume inside the RF ion guide will occur at a specific RF phase which affects the ions' transmission through the RFQ. At optimal phase the ion extraction from the IG-LIS can be improved by 10-50%. Simulations were run considering both fringe field and RFQ phase effects. The method also provides an additional function of IG-LIS to modulate the laser-ionized ions at hundreds of kHz, allowing phase-sensitive detection for experiments downstream. In addition, modulation of the RF envelope (on and off like a gating device) in transmission mode allows for the suppression of surface-ionized species outside the laser-ion pulse, which provides an alternative to a classic fast kicker for beam purification.</description>

      <title>Modeling of surface-state induced inter-electrode isolation of $n$-on-$p$ devices in mixed-field and $\gamma$-irradiation environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the HEP-experiments of High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), the application of isolation implants like $p$-stop between $n^+$-electrodes of position sensitive $n$-on-$p$ sensors has been typically considered to counter the detrimental effect on position resolution of the accumulation of positive net oxide charge with radiation. In addition to the positively charged layer close to the Si/SiO$_2$-interface, surface damage introduced by radiation in SiO$_2$-passivated silicon particle detectors includes the accumulation of trapped-oxide-charge and interface traps. A previous study of either n/$\gamma$ (mixed field)- or $\gamma$-irradiated Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitors showed evidence of substantially higher introduction rates of acceptor- and donor-type deep interface traps ($N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$) in mixed-field environment. In this work, an inter-electrode resistivity ($\rho_\textrm{int}$) TCAD-simulation study of $n$-on-$p$ sensors with and without $p$-stop isolation implants was conducted for both irradiation types. Higher levels of $\rho_\textrm{int}$ showed correlation to higher densities of deep $N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$, with the isolation performance of the mixed-field irradiated sensors becoming independent of the presence of $p$-stop implant between the $n^+$-electrodes throughout the investigated dose range up to about 100 kGy. The low introduction rates of deep $N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$ in $\gamma$-irradiated sensors resulted in high sensitivity of $\rho_\textrm{int}$ to the presence and peak doping of $p$-stop above the lowest dose of 7 kGy in the study. Because of the advantageous influence of radiation-induced accumulation of deep $N_\textrm{it}$ on the inter-electrode isolation, position sensitive $n$-on-$p$ sensors without isolation implants may be considered for future HEP-experiments where the radiation is largely due to hadrons.</description>

      <title>Low-threshold response of a scintillating xenon bubble chamber to nuclear and electronic recoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A device filled with pure xenon first demonstrated the ability to operate simultaneously as a bubble chamber and scintillation detector in 2017. Initial results from data taken at thermodynamic thresholds down to ~4 keV showed sensitivity to ~20 keV nuclear recoils with no observable bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-ray interactions. This paper presents results from further operation of the same device at thermodynamic thresholds as low as 0.50 keV, hardware limited. The bubble chamber has now been shown to have sensitivity to ~1 keV nuclear recoils while remaining insensitive to bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-rays. A robust calibration of the chamber's nuclear recoil nucleation response, as a function of nuclear recoil energy and thermodynamic state, is presented. Stringent upper limits are established for the probability of bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-ray-induced Auger cascades, with a limit of $&lt;1.1\times10^{-6}$ set at 0.50 keV, the lowest thermodynamic threshold explored.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost, Low-Power Media Converter Solution for Next-Generation Detector Readout Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23173v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Energy Physics (HEP) data acquisition systems are often built from high-end FPGAs. As such systems scale in the HL-LHC era, severe under-utilization of FPGA transceivers can occur because front-end links prioritize radiation hardness and power consumption over raw data bandwidth. This work evaluates recently introduced low-power, low-cost FPGA devices as an alternative building block for future readout architectures. This study presents the implementation of a readout back-End on FPGA where the front-end protocol is based on the Low-Power GigaBit Transceiver (lpGBT) and the readout protocol is based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet, using the LHCb Run 4 RICH detector as a practical case study.</description>

      <title>Investigation and optimization of the deconvolution method for PMT waveform reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are extensively employed as photosensors in neutrino and dark matter detection. The precise charge and timing information extracted from the PMT waveform plays a crucial role in energy and vertex reconstruction. In this study, we investigate the deconvolution algorithm utilized for PMT waveform reconstruction, while enhancing the timing separation ability for pile-up hits by redesigning filters based on the time-frequency uncertainty principle. This filter design sacrifices signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve narrower pulse widths. Furthermore, we optimize the selection of signal pulses in the case of low SNR based on Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Monte Carlo data confirms that our optimization yields enhanced reconstruction performance: improving timing separation ability for pile-up hits from $7\sim10$~ns to $3\sim5$~ns, while controlling the residual nonlinearity of charge reconstruction to about 1\% in the range of 0 to 20 photoelectrons.</description>

      <title>Characterizing hole trap production due to proton irradiation in germanium cross-strip detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the effects of high-energy proton damage on charge trapping in germanium cross-strip detectors, with the goal of accomplishing three important measurements. First, we calibrated and characterized the spectral resolution of a spare COSI-balloon detector in order to determine the effects of intrinsic trapping, finding that electron trapping due to impurities dominates over hole trapping in the undamaged detector. Second, we performed two rounds of proton irradiation of the detector in order to quantify, for the first time, the rate at which charge traps are produced by proton irradiation. We find that the product of the hole trap density and cross-sectional area, $[n\sigma]_\mathrm{h}$ follows a linear relationship with the proton fluence, $F_\mathrm{p}$, with a slope of $(5.4\pm0.4)\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{cm/p^{+}}$. Third, by utilizing our measurements of physical trapping parameters, we performed calibrations which corrected for the effects of trapping and mitigated degradation to the spectral resolution of the detector.</description>

      <title>Performance studies of the CE-65v2 MAPS prototype structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the next upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system (ITS3) as its primary focus, a set of small MAPS test structures have been developed in the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS process. The CE-65 focuses on the characterisation of the analogue charge collection properties of this technology. The latest iteration, the CE-65v2, was produced in different processes (standard, with a low-dose n-type blanket, and blanket with gap between pixels), pixel pitches (15, 18, 22.5 $\mu$m), and pixel arrangements (square or staggered). The comparatively large pixel array size of $48\times24$ pixels in CE-65v2 allows the uniformity of the pixel response to be studied, among other benefits.
  The CE-65v2 chip was characterised in a test beam at the CERN SPS. A first analysis showed that hit efficiencies of $\geq 99\%$ and spatial resolution better than 5 $\mu$m can be achieved for all pitches and process variants. For the standard process, thanks to larger charge sharing, even spatial resolutions below 3 $\mu$m are reached, in line with vertex detector requirements for the FCC-ee.
  This contribution further investigates the data collected at the SPS test beam. Thanks to the large sensor size and efficient data collection, a large amount of statistics was collected, which allows for detailed in-pixel studies to see the efficiency and spatial resolution as a function of the hit position within the pixels. Again, different pitches and process variants are compared.</description>
