      <title>Mapping the Photon Detection Efficiency of VUV Sensitive SiPMs from the Ultra-Violet to the Near Infra-Red</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a flexible analytic model describing the Photo-Detection Efficiency (PDE) for P-on-N silicon photomultipliers. This model can be used for device characterization, PDE extrapolation from limited data or design optimization. The model uses six device specific parameters to describe PDE for a large range of wavelengths, angles of incidence, voltages and temperatures. Refractive index data taken from literature are inputs to the model, which also allows the prediction of PDE for devices operated in dense media. We present the measurement of the absolute PDE from 350-830~nm at 163~K for two UV sensitive devices: Hamamatsu VUV4 and the Fondazione Bruno Kessler VUV-HD3. Additional measurements of relative PDE versus angle are performed. We successfully fit the model to the data and show its predictive power, extrapolating the PDE to new wavelengths and to operation in liquid argon and xenon. Lastly we investigate optimizing efficiency for specific applications in astroparticle physics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Covert Fissile Material Production in Nuclear Fusion Reactors via Antineutrino Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion power systems can in principle be used to make significant amounts of fissile material. To do so, an operator would have to introduce fertile material, such as uranium-238, in a suitable region of the reactor where it is exposed to an intense neutron flux. The possibility of using a fusion reactor for this purpose has raised the question of how these facilities can be monitored to ensure their peaceful use. This study examines whether covert production of fissile material in a declared fusion plant could be detected with an onsite antineutrino detector. We find that even a relatively small detector should be able to confirm production rates of a few kilograms of plutonium over 30 days, despite the cosmogenic background and the antineutrino emissions associated with neutron activation of reactor components.</description>

      <title>Advancing rail safety: An onboard measurement system of rolling stock wheel flange wear based on dynamic machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time. Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime. The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2 %. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.</description>

      <title>On the nature and charge state of the X-Defect, a radiation-induced Silicon defect with field-enhanced charge carrier emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elusive X-Defect, a defect found in low-resistivity $p$-type Silicon after irradiation, observed as a low-temperature shoulder of the $\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{O}_\mathrm{i}$ defect (Boron-interstitial-Oxygen-interstitial complex) in Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC) measurements, was investigated to determine its properties, matching them with those of a previously identified defect. Through a combination of TSC, Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS), Difference-DLTS (DDLTS), numerical simulations of field-enhanced charge carrier emissions in TSC measurements and a comparison to literature, the X-Defect was identified as the singly positively charged Silicon di-vacancy $\mathrm{V}_2(+/0)$. This assignment is supported by an agreement in activation energy, capture cross-section, trap type and charge emission process, as well as simulations comparing the effects of phonon-assisted tunnelling (PAT) and Poole-Frenkel (PF) mechanisms on TSC spectra. DDTLS measurements revealed a quadratic dependence of the activation energy on the electric field strength, confirming PAT as the prevailing mechanism over PF in the case of the radiation-induced X-Defect. Assigning the X-Defect to an electrically neutral defect in the space charge region resolves previous contradictions regarding its deficiency in impacting on the effective doping concentration.</description>

      <title>A Neutron Sensitive Detector Using 3D-Printed Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reports on the performance of a novel neutron-sensitive scintillating detector fabricated using Fused-Deposition Modelling (FDM) additive manufacturing. FDM is a cost-effective 3D-printing method employing flexible plastic filaments to create custom-shaped components. Scintillating filaments, based on polystyrene doped with \emph{p}-terphenyl and 1,4-bis (5-phenyloxazol-2-yl) benzene, and enriched with $^6$LiF to enable neutron sensitivity were manufactured in house and achieved visible scintillation with a light output of 30$\pm$5~photons per MeV. Printed scintillators were then integrated into a detector system consisting of an image intensified TimePix3 camera, offering high spatial and temporal resolution. The detector performance was compared with Geant4 simulations of the scintillating sensor's response to electrons, gamma-rays, and thermal neutrons. A novel event discrimination algorithm, using the properties of the TimePix3 camera, enabled the separation of neutron signatures from the gamma-ray background.</description>

      <title>Heatpipe-cooled in-vacuum electromagnet for quantum science experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.</description>
