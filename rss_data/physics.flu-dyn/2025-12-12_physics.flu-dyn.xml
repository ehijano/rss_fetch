      <title>Generating wall-bounded turbulent inflows at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in simulating high Reynolds number ($Re$) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) is the long streamwise distance required for large-scale outer-layer structures to develop, making such simulations prohibitively expensive. We propose an inflow generation method for high $Re$ wall turbulence that leverages the known structure and scaling laws of TBLs, enabling shorter development lengths by providing rich input information. As observed from the inner-scaled pre-multiplied spectra of streamwise velocity, with an increase in $Re$ the outer region grows and occupies more of the spanwise wavenumber space in proportion to the increase in $Re$; while the inner region remains approximately the same. Exploiting this behavior, we generate high-$Re$ inflow conditions for a $\textit{target}$ $Re$ by starting from cross-stream velocity slices at a lower $\textit{base}$ $Re$. In spectral space, we identify the inner and outer region wavenumbers, and shift the outer-region components proportionally to the desired $Re$ increase. We closely examine the capability of this method by scaling a set of velocity slices at $Re_\theta=2240$ and $4430$ to $Re_\theta=8000$, and using them as inflow conditions for direct numerical simulations (DNS) of spatially developing TBLs growing from $Re_\theta=8000-9000$. The skin friction coefficient and shape factor predicted by the new method, regardless of the $\textit{base}$ $Re$ tested, is within $\pm3.5\%$ and $\pm0.5\%$, respectively, of that of a precursor simulation right from the inlet. Reynolds stresses match very well after approximately $8~\delta_{99_0}$. This gives an order of magnitude reduction in development length compared to other methods proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Mixing by offshore wind infrastructure: Resolving the density stratified wakes past vertical cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is focussed on understanding the fundamental fluid dynamics of tidal wakes generated by offshore wind infrastructure in stratified waters, using direct numerical simulations. The tidal flows past the structures are approximated by a uniform quiescent background flow with a two-layer density profile, interacting with a vertically oriented cylinder. Through these simulations we identify the processes through which turbulence generated in the wake of the structures leads to vertical mixing across the thermocline.We identify two fundamentally different flow regimes, dependent on both the stratification strength and the flow Reynolds number. The 'weakly stratified' wake is characterised by a highly energetic wake and a dominance of horizontal shear. As a result, vertical mixing occurs much further downstream than the region of maximum turbulent kinetic energy production. In contrast, the `strongly stratified' wake regime is characterised by a large-scale recirculation region that develops across the thermocline which generates significant vertical shearing. This subsequently leads to time-independent standing waves which account for up to 10% of the total energy budget, and have characteristics similar to 'mode 2' internal solitary waves. The vertical shear introduced near the edges of the thermocline is highly efficient at local mixing, but vertical fluctuations are quickly suppressed as the wake propagates further downstream. We speculate that the emergence of this flow regime may explain discrepancies in previous field observations, which have been unable to detect a coherent wake far downstream of offshore wind infrastructure. Future work should focus on bridging the scale gaps between idealised simulations and the field.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of thermalisation in the Galerkin-truncated, three-dimensional Euler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inviscid, partial differential equations of hydrodynamics when projected via a Galerkin-truncation on a finite-dimensional subspace spanning wavenumbers $-{\bf K}_{\rm G} \le {\bf k} \le {\bf K}_{\rm G}$, and hence retaining a finite number of modes $N_{\rm G}$, lead to absolute equilibrium states. We review how the Galerkin-truncated, three-dimensional, incompressible Euler equation thermalises and its connection to questions in turbulence. We also discuss an emergent pseudo-dissipation range in the energy spectrum and the time-scales associated with thermalisation.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Pressure Recovery in Diffusers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of a data-driven technique based on retrospective cost optimization to optimize the frequency of mass injection into an S-shaped diffuser, with the objective of maximizing the pressure recovery. Experimental data indicated that there is an optimal injection frequency between 100 Hz and 300 Hz with a mass flow rate of 1 percent of the free stream. High-fidelity numerical simulations using compressible unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) are conducted to investigate the mean and temporal features resulting from mass injection into an S-shaped diffuser with differing injection speeds and pulse frequencies. The results are compared with experiments to confirm the accuracy of the numerical solution. Overall, 2-D simulations are relatively in good agreement with the experiment, with 3-D simulations currently under investigation to benchmark the effect of spanwise instabilities. Simulation results with the proposed data-driven technique show improvements upon a baseline case by increasing pressure recovery and reducing the region of flow recirculation within the diffuser.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced giant magnetoresistance in charge-neutral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.</description>

      <title>Corkscrew motion of Trypanosome brucei is driven by helical beating of the flagellum and facilitated by its bent shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, a laterally attached flagellum drives rapid deformation of the complex cell body, producing puzzling dynamics. High-speed defocusing imaging reveals that surface points trace flower-like patterns in transverse planes. The petals arise from clockwise flagellar beating, which generates a right-handed helical wave propagating from the anterior tip along the body, advancing the cell like a twisted corkscrew. The central lobes result from slower counterclockwise body rotation required to balance the active torque. The bent cell shape underneath the flagellum superimposes these two chiral motions at different radial distances, producing the observed patterns. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the method of regularized Stokeslets reproduce these dynamics and show that bent cell shape enhances swimming, suggesting an adaptive advantage of T. brucei's morphology.</description>

      <title>Flow-priority optimization of additively manufactured variable-TPMS lattice heat exchanger based on macroscopic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat exchangers incorporating triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice structures have attracted considerable research interest because they promote uniform flow distribution, disrupt boundary layers, and improve convective heat-transfer performance. However, from the perspective of forming a macroscopic flow pattern optimized for heat-exchange efficiency, a uniform lattice is not necessarily the optimal configuration. This study initially presents a macroscopic modeling approach for a two-fluid heat exchanger equipped with a TPMS Primitive lattice. The macroscopic flow analysis is conducted based on the Darcy--Forchheimer theory. Under the assumption that heat is transferred solely at the interface between the fluid and the TPMS walls, a macroscopic heat-transfer model is developed using a volumetric heat-transfer coefficient, which serves as an artificial property characterizing the unit-volume heat-transfer capability. To regulate the relative dominance of the hot and cold flows-effectively, the channel widths-within the heat exchanger, we adopt the isosurface threshold of the Primitive lattice as the design variable and construct an optimization scheme for the lattice distribution using the previously described macroscopic model. The optimization is subsequently carried out for a planar heat exchanger where the hot and cold fluids each follow U-shaped flow trajectories. The optimal solution was verified, and its validity was examined through detailed geometric analysis and experiments conducted using metal LPBF. The optimal solution derived from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance advantage over the uniform lattice in the experimental results. The optimal solution obtained from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the uniform lattice, with an average enhancement of 28.7% in the experimental results.</description>

      <title>A Kernel-based Resource-efficient Neural Surrogate for Multi-fidelity Prediction of Aerodynamic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.</description>

      <title>Stationary Couette-type flows in relativistic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of stationary, planar-symmetric solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics, in which a dissipative fluid is confined between two parallel plates that move relative to each other and/or are maintained at different temperatures. We find that neglecting the heat flux leads to qualitatively incorrect flow profiles, even in systems with temperature-independent viscosity. This arises from the fact that, in special relativity, the heat flux itself contributes to the momentum density (the so-called "inertia of heat"). This effect is most evident in the Landau frame, where the fluid removes the excess energy generated by viscous heating by streaming across the boundaries. The analysis is further extended to the limit of vanishing chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Friction modifies the quasistatic mechanical response of a confined, poroelastic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical response of elastic porous media confined within rigid geometries is central to a wide range of industrial, geological, and biomedical systems. However, current models for these problems typically overlook the role of wall friction, and particularly its interaction with confinement. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to describe the interplay between the mechanics of the medium and Coulomb friction at the confining walls for slow, quasistatic deformations in response to two canonical uniaxial forcings: piston-driven loading and fluid-driven loading, followed by unloading. We find that, during compression, the stress field evolves according to a quasistatic advection-diffusion equation, extending classical poroelasticity results. The magnitude of friction is controlled by a single dimensionless number proportional to the friction coefficient and the aspect ratio of the confining geometry. During decompression, a portion of the solid matrix remains stuck due to friction, leading to hysteresis and to the propagation of a slip front. In piston-driven loading, the frictional stress is directly coupled to the solid effective stress, leading to exponential damping of the loading and striking changes to the displacement field. However, this coupling limits the energy dissipated by friction. In fluid-driven loading, the pressure gradient locally adds energy, decoupling the frictional stress from the effective stress. The displacement remains qualitatively unchanged but is quantitatively reduced due to large energy dissipation. In both cases, friction can have a substantial impact on the apparent mechanical properties of the medium.</description>

      <title>A Universal Relation Between Intermittency and Dissipation in Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental quantities of turbulent flows, such as the dissipation constant $C_\varepsilon$ and the intermittency factor $\mu$, are examined in relation to each other for a broader class of non-ideal turbulent flows. In the context of the energy cascade, it is known that $C_\varepsilon$ reflects its basic overall properties, while $\mu$ quantifies the intermittency that emerges throughout the cascade. Using an extensive hot-wire dataset of turbulent wakes, grid-generated turbulence, and an axisymmetric jet, we individually analyze these quantities as one-dimensional surrogates of the energy cascade, considering only data that exhibit consistent scaling behavior. We find that $\mu$ is inversely proportional to $C_\varepsilon$, offering a new empirical principle that bridges the gap between large and small scales in arbitrary turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>MFC 5.0: An exascale many-physics flow solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many problems of interest in engineering, medicine, and the fundamental sciences rely on high-fidelity flow simulation, making performant computational fluid dynamics solvers a mainstay of the open-source software community. Previous work, MFC 3.0, was published, documented, and made open-source by Bryngelson et al. CPC (2021) features numerous physical features, numerical methods, and scalable infrastructure. MFC 5.0 is a significant update to MFC 3.0, featuring a broad set of well-established and novel physical models and numerical methods, as well as the introduction of GPU and APU (or superchip) acceleration. We exhibit state-of-the-art performance and ideal scaling on the first two exascale supercomputers, OLCF's Frontier and LLNL's El Capitan. Combined with MFC's single-accelerator performance, MFC achieves exascale computation in practice and has achieved the largest-to-date public CFD simulation at 200 trillion grid points, earning it a 2025 ACM Gordon Bell Prize finalist. New physical features include the immersed boundary method, $N$-fluid phase change, Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange sub-grid bubble models, fluid-structure interaction, hypo- and hyper-elastic materials, chemically reacting flow, two-material surface tension, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and more. Numerical techniques now represent the current state-of-the-art, including general relaxation characteristic boundary conditions, WENO variants, Strang splitting for stiff sub-grid flow features, and low Mach number treatments. Weak scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs on OLCF's Summit and Frontier, and LLNL's El Capitan, achieves efficiencies within 5% of ideal to over 90% of their respective system sizes. Strong scaling results for a 16-fold increase in device count show parallel efficiencies exceeding 90% on OLCF Frontier.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Self-Similar Energy Transfer Dynamics: a Case Study for 1D Burgers System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of constructing initial conditions for a flow model such that the resulting flow evolution leads to a self-similar energy cascade consistent with Kolmogorov's statistical theory of turbulence. As a first step in this direction, we focus on the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation as a toy model. Its solutions exhibiting self-similar behavior, in a precisely-defined sense, are found by framing this problems in terms of PDE-constrained optimization. The main physical parameters are the time window over which self-similar behavior is sought (equal to approximately one eddy turnover time), viscosity (inversely proportional to the ``Reynolds number") and an integer parameter characterizing the distance in the Fourier space over which self-similar interactions occur. Local solutions to this nonconvex PDE optimization problems are obtained with a state-of-the-art adjoint-based gradient method. Two distinct families of solutions, termed viscous and inertial, are identified and are distinguished primarily by the behavior of enstrophy which, respectively, uniformly decays and grows in the two cases. The physically meaningful and appropriately self-similar inertial solutions are found only when a sufficiently small viscosity is considered. These flows achieve the self-similar behaviour by a uniform steepening of the wave fronts present in the solutions. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed methodology may be used to search for self-similar behavior in more complex flow models, including shell models, 2D turbulence and, ultimately, 3D turbulence.</description>

      <title>Role of interfacial stabilization in the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection of liquid-liquid dispersions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on mesoscale lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations, we characterize the Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convective dynamics of dispersions of liquid droplets in another liquid phase. Our numerical methodology allows us to modify the droplets' interfacial properties to mimic the presence of an emulsifier (e.g., a surfactant), resulting in a positive disjoining pressure that stabilizes the droplets against coalescence. To appreciate the effects of this interfacial stabilization on the RB convective dynamics, we carry out a comparative study between a proper emulsion, i.e., a system where the stabilization mechanism is present (stabilized liquid-liquid dispersion), and a system where the stabilization mechanism is absent (non-stabilized liquid-liquid dispersion). The study is conducted by systematically changing both the volume fraction, $\phi$, and the Rayleigh number, Ra. We find that the morphology of the two systems is dramatically different due to the different interfacial properties. However, the two systems exhibit similar global heat transfer properties, expressed via the Nusselt number Nu. Significant differences in heat transfer emerge at smaller scales, which we analyze via the Nusselt number defined at mesoscales, Nu$_{\mathrm{mes}}$. In particular, stabilized systems exhibit more intense mesoscale heat flux fluctuations due to the persistence of fluid velocity fluctuations down to small scales, which are instead dissipated in the interfacial dynamics of non-stabilized dispersions. For fixed Ra, the difference in mesoscale heat flux fluctuations depends non-trivially on $\phi$, featuring a maximum in the range $0.1 &lt; \phi &lt; 0.2$. Taken all together, our results highlight the role of interfacial physics in mesoscale convective heat transfer of complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Identifying efficient routes to laminarization: an optimization approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear and chaotic nature of turbulent flows poses a major challenge for designing effective control strategies to maintain or induce low-drag laminar states. Traditional linear methods often fail to capture the complex dynamics governing transitions between laminar and turbulent regimes. In this work, we introduce the concept of the minimal seed for relaminarization-the closest point to a reference state in the turbulent region of the state space that triggers a direct transition to laminar flow without a chaotic transient. We formulate the identification of this optimal perturbation as a fully nonlinear optimization problem and develop a numerical framework based on a multi-step penalty method to compute it. Applying this framework to a nine-mode model of a sinusoidal shear flow, we compute the minimal seeds for both transition to turbulence and relaminarization. While both of these minimal seeds lie infinitesimally close to the laminar-turbulent boundary-the edge of chaos-they are generally unrelated and lie in distant and qualitatively distinct regions of state space, thereby providing different insights into the flow's underlying structure. We find that the optimal perturbation for triggering transition is primarily in the direction of the mode representing streamwise vortices (rolls), whereas the optimal perturbation for relaminarization is distributed across multiple modes without strong contributions in the roll or streak directions. By analyzing trajectories originating from these minimal seeds, we find that both transition and laminarization behavior are controlled by the stable and unstable manifolds of a periodic orbit on the edge of chaos. The laminarizing trajectory obtained from the minimal seed for relaminarization provides an efficient pathway out of turbulence and can inform the design and evaluation of flow control strategies aimed at inducing laminarization.</description>

      <title>A multiscale numerical approach to investigate interfacial mass transfer in three phase flow: application to metallurgical bottom-blown ladles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use direct numerical simulation (DNS) to investigate mass transfer between liquid steel and slag during a metallurgical secondary refinement process through two reduced-scale water experiments, which reproduce the dynamics seen in an industrial bottom-blown ladle. A container is filled with water and topped by a thin layer of oil, representing the molten steel and slag, respectively. The system is agitated by a bubble plume that impinges on the oil layer and forms an open-eye. A tracer species, dissolved in the water, acts as a passive scalar that is progressively absorbed into the oil layer. Both the hydrodynamics and mass transfer in the system are studied and compared with experiments from the literature of different size and geometry.
  The numerical simulation of mass transfer is challenging due to the high P\'eclet number, leading to extremely thin species boundary layers at the interface. Resolving the boundary layer is prohibitive even with adaptive grid techniques. A subgrid-scale (SGS) boundary layer model corrects the scalar transport equation, allowing us to solve convection-dominated transport on relatively coarse grids. The hydrodynamics is investigated, and we analyze how the resultant flow field governs mass transport. The numerical results recover two flow regimes: a quasi-steady regime at low flow rates with small deformations of the oil-water interface and an atomizing regime at large flow rates. Interfacial species transport is determined to be dominated in an annulus surrounding the open eye caused by a shear layer at the oil-water interface. It is observed that we achieve grid-independent macroscopic quantities that match relatively well with those observed in experiments, allowing use of simulation techniques as a complementary tool going forward.</description>

      <title>Uncovering bistability phenomena in two-layer Couette flow experiments using nonlocal evolution equations</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the stability of interfacial long waves in two-layer plane Couette flow using a nonlinear, nonlocal asymptotic model derived from the Navier-Stokes equations and valid for thin upper layers. Nonlocality enters through a coupling of the thin and main layers, and crucial inertial effects are retained. The models generically support bistability phenomena observed in experiments where two stable travelling waves, one unimodal and the other bimodal, are recorded at the same lid velocity. In direct comparisons with experiments the models show remarkable agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The two stable travelling waves are identified and their basins of attraction characterised via large-time computations for different initial conditions.</description>

Abstract: This investigation derives a novel formula predicting the natural convective heat transfer from an inclined cylinder given its length, diameter, inclination angle, Rayleigh number, and the fluid's Prandtl number and thermal conductivity.
  The present formula was tested with 93 inclined cylinder measurements having length-to-diameter ratios between 1.48 and 104 in nine data-sets from three peer-reviewed studies, yielding (data-set) root-mean-squared relative error values between 1.6% and 4.7%.</description>

      <title>An Euler-Lagrangian Multiphysics Coupling Framework for Particle-Laden High-Speed Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-laden effects in high-speed flows require a coupled Euler and Lagrangian prediction technique with varying fidelity of thermochemical models, depending on the simulation conditions of interest. This requirement makes the development of a conventional monolithic solver challenging to manage the different fidelity of the thermochemical models within a single computational framework. To address this, the present study proposes a multi-solver framework for the coupled Euler-Lagrangian predictions applicable to various particle-laden high-speed flow conditions. Volumetric and surface couplings are established between a particle solver ORACLE (OpenFOAM-based lagRAngian CoupLEr) and a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow solver based on an adaptable data exchange algorithm. The developed framework is then validated by predicting particle-laden supersonic nozzle flows and aerothermal heating around a hypersonic Martian atmospheric entry capsule. Finally, a quasi-1D approximation is proposed in conjunction with a surrogate method to efficiently and accurately predict particle-laden surface erosion, with quantified parametric uncertainty, for hypersonic aerothermal characterization.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signature of vortex mass in Fermi superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum vortices are commonly described as funnel-like objects around which the superfluid swirls, and their motion is typically modeled in terms of massless particles. Here we show that in Fermi superfluids the normal component confined in the vortex core provides the vortex with a finite inertial mass. This inertia imparts an unambiguous signature to the dynamic behavior of vortices, specifically manifesting as small-amplitude transverse oscillations which remarkably follow the prediction of a simple point-like model supplemented by an effective mass. We demonstrate this phenomenon through large-scale time-dependent simulations of Fermi superfluids across a wide range of interaction parameters, at both zero and finite temperatures, and for various initial conditions. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of inertial effects in superfluid vortex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Convection can enhance the capacitive charging of porous electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge transport in porous electrodes is foundational for modern energy storage technologies like supercapacitors, fuel cells, and batteries. Supercapacitors in particular rely solely on storing energy in charged pores. Here, we simulate the charging of a single electrolyte-filled pore using the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. We find that electroconvection can substantially speed up the charging dynamics. We uncover the fundamental mechanism of electroconvection during pore charging through an analytical model that predicts the induced flow field and the electric current arising due to convection. Our findings suggest that convection is especially important in the limit of slender pores with thin electric double layers, and becomes significant beyond a certain threshold voltage that is an inherent electrolyte property.</description>

Abstract: High performance computing (HPC) architectures have undergone rapid development in recent years. As a result, established software suites face an ever increasing challenge to remain performant on and portable across modern systems. Many of the widely adopted atmospheric modeling codes cannot fully (or in some cases, at all) leverage the acceleration provided by General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), leaving users of those codes constrained to increasingly limited HPC resources. Energy Research and Forecasting (ERF) is a regional atmospheric modeling code that leverages the latest HPC architectures, whether composed of only Central Processing Units (CPUs) or incorporating GPUs. ERF contains many of the standard discretizations and basic features needed to model general atmospheric dynamics as well as flows relevant to renewable energy. The modular design of ERF provides a flexible platform for exploring different physics parameterizations and numerical strategies. ERF is built on a state-of-the-art, well-supported, software framework (AMReX) that provides a performance portable interface and ensures ERF's long-term sustainability on next generation computing systems. This paper details the numerical methodology of ERF and presents results for a series of verification and validation cases.</description>

      <title>Impacting spheres: from liquid drops to elastic beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many biological, culinary, and engineering processes lead to the co-encapsulation of several soft particles within a liquid interface. In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.</description>
