      <title>Securing the Language of Life: Inheritable Watermarks from DNA Language Models to Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA language models have revolutionized our ability to understand and design DNA sequences--the fundamental language of life--with unprecedented precision, enabling transformative applications in therapeutics, synthetic biology, and gene editing. However, this capability also poses substantial dual-use risks, including the potential for creating pathogens, viruses, and even bioweapons. To address these biosecurity challenges, we introduce two innovative watermarking techniques to reliably track the designed DNA: DNAMark and CentralMark. DNAMark employs synonymous codon substitutions to embed watermarks in DNA sequences while preserving the original function. CentralMark further advances this by creating inheritable watermarks that transfer from DNA to translated proteins, leveraging protein embeddings to ensure detection across the central dogma. Both methods utilize semantic embeddings to generate watermark logits, enhancing robustness against natural mutations, synthesis errors, and adversarial attacks. Evaluated on our therapeutic DNA benchmark, DNAMark and CentralMark achieve F1 detection scores above 0.85 under various conditions, while maintaining over 60% sequence similarity to ground truth and degeneracy scores below 15%. A case study on the CRISPR-Cas9 system underscores CentralMark's utility in real-world settings. This work establishes a vital framework for securing DNA language models, balancing innovation with accountability to mitigate biosecurity risks.</description>

      <title>Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification, scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning recipe for diverse biology tasks.</description>

      <title>CEP-IP: An Explainable Framework for Cell Subpopulation Identification in Single-cell Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12073</link>

Abstract: TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. This study introduces the CEP-IP framework, a novel explainable machine learning approach for the identification of biologically relevant cell subpopulations in single-cell transcriptomics of pairwise genes. The framework combines cell explanatory power (CEP) classification with inflection point (IP) analysis to assign model performance into individual cells, while stratifying transcriptional space into distinct regions. To demonstrate the CEP-IP framework, generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to model relationships between TRPM4 and co-expressed genes in aggressive PCa and benign prostate cells from scRNA-seq data. Genes were identified using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, RPS26; averaged as Ribo gene set) passed dual-filtering specifically in PCa cells. TRPM4-Ribo modeling outperformed alternative cancer gene sets (deviance explained FDR&lt;0.05). The CEP-IP framework identified top-ranked explanatory power (TREP) cells and stratified them using IP analysis into pre-IP and post-IP regions, creating four distinct cell subpopulations per patient. Gene Ontology analysis revealed pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related processes, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion pathways. In conclusion, the explainable CEP-IP framework allows for the identification of cancer cell subpopulations with distinctive biology and therapeutic implications, applicable to any pairwise gene analysis.</description>
