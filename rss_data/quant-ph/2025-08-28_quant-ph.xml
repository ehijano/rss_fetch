      <title>Quantum Resource Management in the NISQ Era: Challenges, Vision, and a Runtime Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers represent a radical technological advancement in the way information is processed by using the principles of quantum mechanics to solve very complex problems that exceed the capabilities of classical systems. However, in the current NISQ era (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices), the available hardware presents several limitations, such as a limited number of qubits, high error rates, and reduced coherence times. Efficient management of quantum resources, both physical (qubits, error rates, connectivity) and logical (quantum gates, algorithms, error correction), becomes particularly relevant in the design and deployment of quantum algorithms. In this work, we analyze the role of resources in the various uses of NISQ devices today, identifying their relevance and implications for software engineering focused on the use of quantum computers. We propose a vision for runtime-aware quantum software development, identifying key challenges to its realization, such as limited introspection capabilities and temporal constraints in current platforms. As a proof of concept, we introduce Qonscious, a prototype framework that enables conditional execution of quantum programs based on dynamic resource evaluation. With this contribution, we aim to strengthen the field of Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE) and move towards the development of scalable, reliable, and resource-aware quantum software.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new perspective on unifying all fundamental interactions--gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong--based on stochastic processes rather than conventional quantum mechanics. Earlier work by Nelson, Kac and others have established that key quantum features such as the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations together with the Born rule can be derived from classical random processes involving finite speeds and probabilistic reversals. A fundamental length scale, inherent for dimensional consistency, regularizes the infinities that typically plague conventional field theories. The method can be used to quantize electrodynamics as well as linear gravity, using the Riemann-Silberstein vector and its generalization.
  To include fields beyond electromagnetism, the Riemann-Silberstein vector can be generalized to describe non-Abelian gauge fields without relying on gauge symmetry. These fields can be coupled to spin networks--geometric structures that discretize space--leading to a unified framework that includes both matter and geometrty. In the large-scale limit, the model reproduces familiar quantum field behaviour, while remaining finite and background-independent at the fundamental level. The emergence of equilibrium states resembling Wheeler-DeWill constraints in gravity adds further depth, suggesting a novel route to quantum gravity and unification grounded in physical stochasticity rather than quantization rules.</description>

      <title>Time Symmetry, Retrocausality, and Emergent Collapse: The Tlalpan Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has remained conceptually puzzling since its inception. While its mathematical formalism provides predictions of unparalleled accuracy, the interpretative framework underpinning measurement and collapse has never been fully clarified. The Tlalpan Interpretation (QTI) proposes that the wavefunction collapse is not a primitive, axiomatic rule but an emergent phenomenon, a spontaneous breaking of time symmetry triggered by amplification and record creation. The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse within the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics. The theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the record asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order parameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus characterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with thresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets. This perspective allows the interpretation to retain microscopic time symmetry and spatial locality, while attributing quantum correlations and Bell-type violations to retrocausal boundary constraints rather than instantaneous action at a distance. Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the conversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete, irreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable. It predicts: (1) sharp threshold-like disappearance of interference when amplification exceeds a critical value, (2) anomalously fast decay of reversibility in chaotic optical cavities compared with regular ones, and (3) qualitatively new interference fringes in a time-symmetric generalization of Moshinsky's diffraction in time. If confirmed, these predictions would place collapse squarely in the realm of thermodynamic processes, removing the last "mystical" postulate from quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement as Super-Confounding: From Bell's Theorem to Robust Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's theorem reveals a profound conflict between quantum mechanics and local realism, a conflict we reinterpret through the modern lens of causal inference. We propose and computationally validate a framework where quantum entanglement acts as a "super-confounding" resource, generating correlations that violate the classical causal bounds set by Bell's inequalities. This work makes three key contributions: First, we establish a physical hierarchy of confounding (Quantum &gt; Classical) and introduce Confounding Strength (CS) to quantify this effect. Second, we provide a circuit-based implementation of the quantum $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus to distinguish causality from spurious correlation. Finally, we apply this calculus to a quantum machine learning problem, where causal feature selection yields a statistically significant 11.3% average absolute improvement in model robustness. Our framework bridges quantum foundations and causal AI, offering a new, practical perspective on quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Finite-Time Thermodynamics of Effective Two-Level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain "real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.</description>

      <title>First-Quantized Quantum Simulation of Non-Relativistic QED with Emergent Topologically Protected Coulomb Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a simulation algorithm that properly addresses light matter interaction between non-relativistic first-quantized charged particles and quantum electromagnetic fields. Unlike previous work, our Hamiltonian does not include an explicit Coulomb interaction between particles. Rather, the Coulomb interaction emerges from the imposition of Gauss' law as a constraint upon the system in an appropriate non-relativistic limit. Furthermore, a form of topological protection emerges in our formalism, analogous to that of the Toric code Hamiltonian. This mechanism prevents simulation-induced electric field errors that can be contracted to a point from causing any deviations from Coulomb's law in the non-relativistic limit and any error that forms a non-contractable loop is energetically dissallowed in the limit of large volume. We find that, under appropriate continuity assumptions, the number of non-Clifford gates required by our algorithm scales in the thermodynamic limit as $\widetilde{O}(N^{2/3}\eta^{4/3} t \log^5(1/\epsilon))$ for $\eta$ particles, $N$ spatial grid points, simulation time $t$ and error tolerance $\epsilon$. In comparison, the more specific problem of simulating the Coulomb interaction scales as $\widetilde{O}(N^{1/3} \eta^{8/3} t \log^2(1/\epsilon))$. This suggests that if $N \in \tilde{o}(\eta^4)$ that our non-relativistic electrodynamic simulation method could provide a computational advantage for electronic structure problems in the thermodynamic limit under appropriate continuity assumptions as it obviates the need to compute the $O(\eta^2)$ pairwise interactions in the Coulomb Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Jaynes-Cummings model with time-dependent coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model stands as a fully quantized, fundamental framework for exploring light-matter interactions, a timely reflection on a century of quantum theory. The time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (TDJC) model introduces temporal variations in certain parameters, which often require numerical methods. However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.</description>

      <title>From \'Etendue to the Lowest Fundamental SNR: Pixel \'Etendue (Optogeometric Factor) Interpreted as Mode Count</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optogeometric factor, recently introduced as a pixel level form of \'etendue, quantifies the spatial angular throughput of a detector element. In this work its interpretation is extended by identifying optogeometric factor with the number of accessible optical modes per pixel. This mode based perspective establishes a direct link between radiometric throughput and quantum photon statistics.
  By combining optogeometric factor with the Bose Einstein distribution, an estimate of the lowest achievable signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the pixel level is derived.
  Explicit formulas are presented in both scene-based and sensor based forms, showing how the minimal SNR depends on aperture geometry, pixel pitch, f-number, wavelength, and source temperature. This formulation provides a compact and physically transparent benchmark for evaluating imaging sensors against the lowest expected quantum noise limit.</description>

      <title>Is data-efficient learning feasible with quantum models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of analyzing nontrivial datasets when testing quantum machine learning (QML) models is becoming increasingly prominent in literature, yet a cohesive framework for understanding dataset characteristics remains elusive. In this work, we concentrate on the size of the dataset as an indicator of its complexity and explores the potential for QML models to demonstrate superior data-efficiency compared to classical models, particularly through the lens of quantum kernel methods (QKMs). We provide a method for generating semi-artificial fully classical datasets, on which we show one of the first evidence of the existence of classical datasets where QKMs require less data during training. Additionally, our study introduces a new analytical tool to the QML domain, derived for classical kernel methods, which can be aimed at investigating the classical-quantum gap. Our empirical results reveal that QKMs can achieve low error rates with less training data compared to classical counterparts. Furthermore, our method allows for the generation of datasets with varying properties, facilitating further investigation into the characteristics of real-world datasets that may be particularly advantageous for QKMs. We also show that the predicted performance from the analytical tool we propose - a generalization metric from classical domain - show great alignment empirical evidence, which fills the gap previously existing in the field. We pave a way to a comprehensive exploration of dataset complexities, providing insights into how these complexities influence QML performance relative to traditional methods. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the generalization benefits of QKM models and potentially a broader family of QML models, setting the stage for future advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Remote Quantum Networks based on Quantum Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks, capable of transmitting arbitrary quantum states, provide a foundation for a wide range of quantum applications, including distributed quantum computing, distributed quantum sensing, and quantum communication. Photons are the natural carrier of information in quantum networks, but the exponential loss of optical fiber channels prevents the construction of large-scale quantum networks. A potential solution is implementing quantum repeaters based on quantum memories, which can efficiently establish long-distance entanglement from short-distance entanglement. In the past decades, intense efforts have been devoted to constructing large-scale quantum networks based on various atomic quantum memories. In this Perspective, we present a concise overview of current advancements in remote quantum networks, elucidate the imminent challenges that must be addressed, and discuss the future directions.</description>

      <title>One Rudolf Peierls' surprise: the quantum-to-classical transition in the context of solid-state physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solid state physics, it is an unsaid (tacit) assumption that the Bloch theorem is applicable to a crystal lattice even if it is of the macroscopic dimensions, provided periodicity is maintained. However, in a realistic situation, electrons in a periodic potential of ions constitute an open quantum system and are subjected to decoherence and dissipation. A natural question arises: up to what distances electrons in a periodic potential can be considered as constituting an effective closed quantum system? And what is the cause of decoherence? To answer some of these questions, the seminal theory of Ovchinnikov and Erikhman of decoherence due to ionic motion is revisited and an oversight of the authors is corrected. Correct conditions for decoherence to occur are worked out. Length scale up to which the motion of ions remains coherent is also calculated. Finally, a realistic physical picture is discussed.</description>

      <title>Fourier transform-based linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) connects the general linear non-unitary dynamics with unitary operators and serves as the mathematical backbone of designing near-optimal quantum linear differential equation algorithms. However, the existing LCHS formalism needs to find a kernel function subject to complicated technical conditions on a half complex plane. In this work, we establish an alternative formalism of LCHS based on the Fourier transform. Our new formalism completely removes the technical requirements beyond the real axis, providing a simple and flexible way of constructing LCHS kernel functions. Specifically, we construct a different family of the LCHS kernel function, providing a $1.81$ times reduction in the quantum differential equation algorithms based on LCHS, and an $8.27$ times reduction in its quantum circuit depth at a truncation error of $\epsilon \le 10^{-8}$. Additionally, we extend the scope of the LCHS formula to the scenario of simulating linear unstable dynamics for a short or intermediate time period.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic quantum memories are essential components for scalable quantum networks and photonic information processors. However, prior implementations have been confined to single-channel operation, limiting their capacity to manipulate multiple photonic pulses and support high-dimensional information. In this work, we introduce an 11-channel integrated quantum memory based on laser-written waveguide arrays in $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals. On-chip electrode arrays enable independent control over the readout times for each channel via Stark-shift-induced atomic interference. Our device achieves random-access quantum storage of three time-bin qubits with a fidelity exceeding 99%, as well as storage of five-dimensional path-encoded quantum states with a fidelity above 96%. This multichannel integrated storage device enables versatile applications through its random access capability and lays a solid foundation for the development of high-dimensional quantum networks in integrated architectures.</description>

      <title>Near-Ultimate Quantum-Enhanced Sensitivity in Dissipative Critical Sensing with Partial Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors are powerful devices that exploit quantum effects to detect minute quantities with extremely high precision. Two obstacles to harnessing the full capacity of quantum probes are the resource-intensive preparation of the probe and the need for sophisticated measurements that typically require full access to the entire probe. Here, we address these challenges by investigating the driven Jaynes-Cummings system undergoing a dissipative quantum phase transition as a quantum sensor. We show that detuning the system off resonance significantly improves sensing performance by adequately selecting a preferred bistable state in phase space. Our dissipative sensor, independent of the initial probe preparation, exhibits a super-linear enhancement in sensitivity with respect to a specific sensing resource -- the strong-coupling regime ratio -- which manifests in both the full system and partial subsystem. Hence, quantum-enhanced sensitivity persists even when only partial system accessibility is available. Remarkably, we show that a homodyne detection of the field state, combined with Bayesian estimation, nearly saturates the ultimate sensitivity limit of the entire system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a technique for reconstructing the dynamics of open quantum systems under the Born-Markov approximation, as described by a Liouvillian superoperator, capturing both coherent and dissipative processes. While QPT is well established for qubits, it presents significant experimental challenges in multi-level qudits. In room-temperature atomic vapors, these difficulties arise from complex interactions, residual fields present in the system, environmental noise, and inhomogeneities in the medium. Overcoming these limitations is essential for accurate modeling and precise control of such systems--a critical step toward practical usage of the QPT. We present a QPT method that we experimentally validate on a room-temperature $^{87}$Rb vapor ensemble, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of qutrit Liouvillians. Our approach establishes a computationally efficient framework for characterizing open quantum systems, enabling the study of non-unitary dynamics, efficient benchmarking of quantum sensors, and data-driven identification of environmental noise correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Quantum Dynamical Properties with Two Experimental Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum dynamics is essential for quantifying arbitrary properties of a quantum process -- such as its ability to exhibit quantum-mechanical dynamics or generate entanglement. However, current methods require a number of experimental settings that increases with system size, leading to artifacts from experimental errors. Here, we propose an approximate optimization method that estimates property measures using only two mutually unbiased bases to compute their lower and upper bounds, and to reconstruct the corresponding processes. This system-size independence prevents error accumulation and allows characterization of the intrinsic quantum dynamics. Compared with quantum process tomography, we experimentally validate our method on photonic fusion and controlled-NOT operations, demonstrating accurate resource estimation while substantially reducing the number of required Pauli experimental settings: from 81 to 10 for the photonic fusion and to 2 for the controlled-NOT. These results show that our method is well-suited for estimation of dynamical properties in architectures ranging from chip-scale quantum processors to long-distance quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Selective Preparation of Collective States in Coupled Quantum Emitters Using the SUPER Excitation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient preparation of collective eigenstates of subwavelength-spaced optical dipoles is a prerequisite for observing their signature radiative properties and for their applications in quantum information processing. We theoretically investigate the deterministic preparation of superradiant and subradiant states of two dipole-coupled two-level quantum emitters at deep-subwavelength separation using the Swing-UP of Quantum Emitter Population (SUPER) excitation scheme. Utilizing suitable pulse parameters for two red-detuned, time-overlapping Gaussian pulses, the SUPER scheme enables close-to-unity population inversion in the targeted collective eigenstates. Furthermore, a tunable optical phase in the SUPER scheme enables the simultaneous inversions in both pure super- and subradiant states with finite populations, thereby resulting in the preparation of hybrid collective states. These results are possible to realize with or without an optical cavity. Our approach to populating the collective eigenstates in a cavity environment paves the way for the efficient preparation of these states in the presence of environmental decoherence. Our scheme enables single-photon generation, which is measured using the second-order correlation function. We also discuss in detail possible experimental realizations, in particular using solid-state emitters and molecules.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between bodies integrated in a micro/nanoelectromechanical quantum damped oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements.</description>

      <title>Optimal control on open quantum systems and application to non-Condon photo-induced electron transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an optimal control theory on open quantum system and its environment, and exemplify the method with the application to the non-Condon photo-induced electron transfer (PET) in condensed phase. This method utilizes the dissipaton theory, proposed by Yan in 2014 for open quantum systems, which provides an exact description of the dissipative system while also enables rigorous characterization and control of environmental hybridization modes, fully taking into account the non-perturbative and non-Markovian effects. Leveraging the advantage of the dissipaton phase-space algebra, we present in this communication the theoretical strategy for optimal control on both system and environment simultaneously. The control protocol is successfully demonstrated on PET for the environment-targeted-control facilitated transfer. This work sheds the light on manipulating open systems dynamics via polarized environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of Hermitian operators is canonical if they satisfy the canonical commutation relation. It has been believed that no such canonical pair exists in finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Here, we obtain canonical pairs by noting that the canonical commutation relation holds in a proper subspace of the Hilbert space. For a given Hilbert space, we study the many possible canonical pairs and look into the uncertainty relation they satisfy. We apply our results by constructing time operators in finite-dimensional quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we suggest a modification of Grover's algorithm, based on a multiphase oracle which marks each solution with a different phase when there is more than one solution. Such a modification can be used to maintain a high probability of finding a solution for a number of iterations equal to or more than the one required by the deterministic Grover's algorithm (the one based on generalized Householder reflections). We use various semiempirical methods to show that the interval of number of iterations for which the algorithm keeps the probability of finding solution high depends on the register size and the oracle phases.</description>

      <title>Partial Anyon Condensation in the Color Code: A Hamiltonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice Hamiltonians, which can be tuned between different topological phases, are known as important tools for understanding physical mechanism behind topological phase transitions. In this paper, we introduce a perturbed Color Code Hamiltonian with a rich phase structure which can be well matched to the mechanism of anyon condensation in the Color Code. We consider Color Code model defined on a three-colorable hexagonal lattice and add Ising interactions between spins corresponding to edges of the lattice. We show that Ising interactions play the role of physical factor for condensing anyons in the Color Code. In particular, corresponding to three different colors of edges in the hexagonal lattice, we consider three different coupling parameters. Then, we are able to condense anyons with different colors by tuning power of Ising interactions in the corresponding edges. In particular, we explicitly show that condensation of one type of anyons in the Color Code leads to a phase transition to the Toric Code state. On the other hand, by condensing two types of anyons, we observe a phase transition to a modified version of the Toric Code where partial set of anyons in the Toric Code are condensed and we call it a partially topological phase. Our main method for derivation of the above results is based on a suitable basis transformation on the main Hamiltonian in the sense that our model is mapped onto three decoupled transverse-field Ising models, corresponding to the three colors. We use the above mapping to analyze behavior of string order parameters as non-local indicators of topological order. We introduce three string order parameters that can well characterize different phases of the model. Specifically we give a simple description of the partially condensed phase by using string order parameters.</description>

      <title>Measuring non-Gaussianity with Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussianity is a key resource for quantum advantage in continuous-variable systems. We introduce a general framework to quantify non-Gaussianity based on correlation generation: two copies of a state become correlated at a $50{:}50$ beam splitter if and only if the state is non-Gaussian, with correlations reducing to entanglement in the pure-state case. This connection enables operational measures of non-Gaussianity, defined through correlation quantifiers such as R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy for pure states and R\'enyi-$\alpha$ mutual information for mixed states. We prove that all such measures are monotonic under Gaussian channels. Building on this framework, we propose a sample-efficient experimental protocol to estimate non-Gaussianity using standard optical components, even in the state agnostic setting. Finally, we establish a lower bound on the sample complexity of estimating Wigner negativity, allowing a direct comparison with our protocol. Our results provide both a unifying theoretical framework for non-Gaussianity and a practical route toward its experimental quantification.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum topological data analysis: torsion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) has become an attractive area for the application of quantum computing. Recent advances have uncovered many interesting connections between the two fields. On one hand, complexity theoretic results show that estimating Betti numbers, a central task in TDA, is NP hard, indicating that a generic quantum speedup is unlikely. On the other hand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings and demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups under certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti numbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity and holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of topological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of homology that can reveal richer structural information. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for torsion detection, that is, determining whether a given simplicial complex contains torsion. Our algorithm, assisted by a low complexity classical procedure, can succeed with high probability and potentially offer exponential speedup over the classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Direct probing of the simulation complexity of open quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.</description>

      <title>Hyper-spectral Imaging with Up-Converted Mid-Infrared Single-Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range provides unique molecular specificity by probing fundamental vibrational modes of molecular bonds, making it highly valuable for biomedical and biochemical applications. However, conventional MIR imaging techniques often rely on high-intensity illumination that can induce photodamage in sensitive biological tissues. Single-photon MIR imaging offers a label-free, non-invasive alternative, yet its adoption is hindered by the lack of efficient, room-temperature MIR single-photon detectors. We present a single-photon hyperspectral imaging platform that combines cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with nonlinear frequency up-conversion. This approach enables MIR spectral imaging using cost-effective, visible-wavelength silicon single-photon avalanche diodes (Si-SPADs), supporting room-temperature, low-noise, and high-efficiency operation. Time-correlated photon pairs generated via SPDC suppress classical intensity noise, enabling near shot-noise-limited hyperspectral imaging. We demonstrate chemically specific single-photon imaging across the \SIrange{2.9}{3.6}{\micro\meter} range on biological (egg yolk, yeast) and polymeric (polystyrene, polyethylene) samples. The system delivers high-contrast, label-free imaging at ultralow photon flux, overcoming key limitations of current MIR technologies. This platform paves the way toward scalable, quantum-enabled MIR imaging for applications in molecular diagnostics, environmental sensing, and biomedical research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an experimental scheme for high-precision position measurements based on transverse-momentum-resolved two-photon interferometry with independent photons and SPAD arrays. Our scheme extends the operative range of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry beyond its intrinsic constraints due to photons indistinguishability, paving the way to applications in high-resolution imaging. We assess the experimental results against the ultimate precision bounds as determined by quantum estimation theory. Our experiment ultimately proves that transverse-momentum resolved measurements of fourth-order correlations in the fields can be employed to overcome spatial distiguishability between independent photons. The relevance of our results extends beyond sensing and imaging towards quantum information processing, as we show that partial photon distinguishability and entanglement impurity are not necessarily a nuisance in a technique that relies on two-photon interference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing using local modes of trapped ions has been applied to implementing bosonic quantum error correction codes and conducting efficient quantum simulation of bosonic systems. However, control of entanglement among local modes remains difficult because entaglement among resonant local modes is governed by the Coulomb interaction, which is not switchable. We propose a method of a beamsplitter for a trapped-ion architecture, where the secular frequency of each mode is dynamically controllable. The neighboring modes are far detuned except when the beamsplitter needs to be applied to them. We derive the analytical formula of the proposed procedure and numerically confirm its validity.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Domain Wall Reconfiguration Dynamics in a Quantum Material via Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum materials relax from metastable states poses a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. In the layered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a uniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover from thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of quantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the microscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that single-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle transitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration rates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is rescaled as $T \to h_x^n T$ with $n \approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of first- and second-order single-particle processes. This enables us to reconstruct a microscopic relaxation pathway consisting of cyclical polaron leakage followed by cascades of tunneling events. Our results establish quantum simulation as a powerful tool for inferring real-space mechanisms in strongly correlated systems and demonstrate a concrete strategy for bridging effective spin models with the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imminent threat of quantum computing necessitates quantum-resistant cryptosystems. This paper establishes tight security bounds for two NIST PQC finalists: SPHINCS+ (hash-based) and NTRU (lattice-based). Our key contributions include: (1) A quantum attack model incorporating decoherence effects ($\tau_d$) and parallelization limits; (2) Improved entropy concentration inequalities reducing SPHINCS+ parameters by 15-20\%; (3) Optimized NTRU lattice parameters via quantum lattice entropy $H_Q(\Lambda)$; (4) Tightened NTRU-to-LWE reduction with polynomial-factor improvement. Theoretical results demonstrate significant security enhancement over existing constructions, providing implementable parameters for standardization.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of a one-dimensional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases $\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J&lt;0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Molecular Autoencoder for Advancing Classical Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML) offer significant potential for enhancing generative models, particularly in molecular design, a large array of classical approaches still face challenges in achieving high fidelity and validity. In particular, the integration of QML with sequence-based tasks, such as Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) string reconstruction, remains underexplored and usually suffers from fidelity degradation. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture for SMILES reconstruction that integrates quantum encoding with classical sequence modeling to improve quantum fidelity and classical similarity. Our approach achieves a quantum fidelity of approximately 84% and a classical reconstruction similarity of 60%, surpassing existing quantum baselines. Our work lays a promising foundation for future QML applications, striking a balance between expressive quantum representations and classical sequence models and catalyzing broader research on quantum-aware sequence models for molecular and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian after a local quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the entanglement Hamiltonian in a system of one-dimensional free fermions, following a local joining quench of two initially disconnected half-chains in their ground states. Applying techniques of conformal field theory, we obtain a local expression where the left- and right-moving components of the energy density are associated with different weight functions. The results are then compared to numerical calculations for the hopping chain, which requires to consider a proper continuum limit of the lattice entanglement Hamiltonian, obtaining a good agreement with the field-theory prediction.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization for Tensor Disentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide compact and scalable representations of high-dimensional data, enabling efficient computation in fields such as quantum physics, numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), and machine learning. This paper focuses on tensor disentangling, the task of identifying transformations that reduce bond dimensions by exploiting gauge freedom in the network. We formulate this task as an optimization problem over orthogonal matrices acting on a single tensor's indices, aiming to minimize the rank of its matricized form. We present Riemannian optimization methods and a joint optimization framework that alternates between optimizing the orthogonal transformation for a fixed low-rank approximation and optimizing the low-rank approximation for a fixed orthogonal transformation, offering a competitive alternative when the target rank is known. To seek the often unknown optimal rank, we introduce a binary search strategy integrated with the disentangling procedure. Numerical experiments on random tensors and tensors in an approximate isometric tensor network state are performed to compare different optimization methods and explore the possibility of combining different methods in a hybrid approach.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of light rare-earth magnetic anisotropy with density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has long struggled to treat light rare-earth magnetism. We show that this difficulty arises from an overestimate of the $4f$ charge asphericity, and thus the magnetic anisotropy energy, due to the inadequacy of single Slater-determinant representations. We propose an effective solution by combining constrained DFT+U with crystal field theory and a systematic many-body correction to the charge asphericity. We confirm the validity of this combination on TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and TbCo$_5$, and then show how the many-body correction adjusts the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy of SmCo$_5$ to match experiment. Our method is an efficient DFT-based approach to address light-rare-earth magnetism.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos, Thermalization, and Non-locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically investigate whether quantum thermalization occurs during the time evolution induced by a non-local Hamiltonian whose spectra exhibit integrability. This non-local and integrable Hamiltonian is constructed by combining two types of integrable Hamiltonians. From the time dependence of entanglement entropy and mutual information, we find that non-locality can evolve the system into the typical state. On the other hand, the time dependence of logarithmic negativity shows that the non-locality can destroy the quantum correlation. These findings suggest that the quantum thermalization induced by the non-local Hamiltonian does not require the quantum chaoticity of the system.</description>

      <title>Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of thermodynamically stable hydrides. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of $T_{\rm c}$. Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic thermodynamically stable hydrides with $T_{\rm c}$ above 4.2 K and reach a maximum $T_{\rm c}$ of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>

      <title>Quantum latent distributions in deep generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many successful families of generative models leverage a low-dimensional latent distribution that is mapped to a data distribution. Though simple latent distributions are commonly used, it has been shown that more sophisticated distributions can improve performance. For instance, recent work has explored using the distributions produced by quantum processors and found empirical improvements. However, when latent space distributions produced by quantum processors can be expected to improve performance, and whether these improvements are reproducible, are open questions that we investigate in this work. We prove that, under certain conditions, these "quantum latent distributions" enable generative models to produce data distributions that classical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We also provide actionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in real-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic quantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real photonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent distributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a range of classical baselines. We also explore diffusion and flow matching models, identifying architectures compatible with quantum latent distributions. This work confirms that near-term quantum processors can expand the capabilities of deep generative models.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic chamber setup for superfluid helium experiments with optical fiber and electrical access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid helium is a prototypical quantum liquid. As such, it has been a prominent platform for the study of quantum many body physics. More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal decomposition of unitary matrices using phase masks and the discrete Fourier transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal multiport interferometers (UMIs) have emerged as a key tool for performing arbitrary linear transformations on optical modes, enabling precise control over the state of light in essential applications of classical and quantum information processing such as neural networks and boson sampling. While UMI architectures based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks are well established, alternative approaches that involve interleaving fixed multichannel mixing layers and phase masks have recently gained interest due to their high robustness to losses and fabrication errors. However, these approaches currently lack optimal analytical methods to compute design parameters with low optical depth. In this work, we introduce a constructive decomposition of unitary matrices using a sequence of $2N+5$ phase masks interleaved with $2N+4$ discrete Fourier transform matrices. This decomposition can be leveraged to design universal interferometers based on phase masks and multimode interference couplers, implementing a discrete Fourier transform, offering an analytical alternative to conventional numerical optimization-based designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that strong interactions combined with band-dependent imaginary vector potentials give rise to boundary localization of particle-hole pairs, which we term the excitonic skin effect. In a bilayer system with layer-specific gain/loss and an in-plane magnetic field, excitons experience a net imaginary vector potential, resulting in directional amplification of particle-hole pairs. Including nearest-neighbor interactions leads to a non-Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model, where the pairing effects grow exponentially with the size of the system, revealing a unique form of critical skin effect in interacting systems. Our framework applies to both atomic and electronic platforms and is directly testable in current experiments. These results also provide a route to explore non-Hermitian analogs of tensor gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Correlated decoherence and thermometry with mobile impurities in a 1D Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic light cone, slow entanglement growth, and quantum memory</title>

Abstract: Effective light cones, characterized by Lieb-Robinson bounds, emerge in nonrelativistic local quantum systems. Here, we present several analytical results derived from logarithmic light cones (LLCs). Possible origins of LLCs include the one-dimensional (1D) disordered XXZ model and a phenomenological model of many-body localization (MBL). In the LLC regime, we prove that, for arbitrary spatial dimensions and any initial pure state, entanglement growth is upper-bounded by logarithmic time with an additional subleading \emph{double-logarithmic} correction -- arising from a real asymptotic solution of the \emph{Lambert W} function -- valid up to the asymptotic time limit. In the context of the 1D disordered XXZ model, this result resolves the ambiguity in distinguishing between logarithmic and power-law fits of entanglement growth in numerical studies; we also propose a falsifiable phenomenological functional form for the entanglement growth that agrees with existing numerical results. We show that information scrambling is logarithmically slow in the LLC regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLC supports long-lived quantum memories -- quantum codes with macroscopic code distance and lifetimes that scale exponentially with system size -- under unitary time evolution. Our analytical results provide benchmarks for future numerical studies of the MBL regime at large time scales.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of universal quantum gates and six-qubit entangled state using photonic quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum computation using photons, performing deterministic quantum gate operations is a challenge due to the probabilistic nature of the photon-photon interaction. Encoding qubits in multiple degrees-of-freedom of photons and controlling operations between them is one of the promising ways to navigate the probabilistic behavior. Using single-photon discrete-time quantum walk in combination with polarization and path degrees-of-freedom, we experimentally demonstrate the realization of a universal set of quantum gates with high fidelity at room temperature. The deterministic realization of quantum gates through photonic quantum walk are characterized via quantum state tomography. For a three-qubit system using a single photon, the first qubit is encoded using polarization information, and the other two qubits are encoded using path information, closely resembling a Galton-board setup. To generate a six-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, entangled photon pairs are used to entangle the two three-qubit modules on which gate operations are performed. We also provide insights into the mapping of photonic quantum walk operations to quantum circuits and propose methods to resourcefully scale. This demonstration marks a significant progress towards using quantum walks for quantum computing and provides a framework for using fewer photons in combination with different degrees-of-freedom of photon to scale the number of qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an information-theoretic derivation of quantum theory in which the existence of an energy observable that limits the speed of state change follows directly from physical principles. Our first principle is that every reversible dynamics can be implemented through a collision model, i.e. a sequence of fast collisions with an array of identically prepared systems. Combined with four additional principles, known as causality, classical decomposability, purity preservation, and strong symmetry, the collision model pins down the quantum framework, sets up a one-to-one correspondence between energy observables and generators of the dynamics, and provides an information-theoretic derivation of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on the speed of quantum evolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.</description>

Abstract: The understanding of open quantum systems is crucial for the development of quantum technologies. Of particular relevance is the characterisation of divisible quantum dynamics, seen as a generalisation of Markovian processes to the quantum setting. Here, we propose a way to detect divisibility and quantify how non-divisible a quantum channel is through the concept of channel discrimination. We ask how well we can distinguish generic dynamics from divisible dynamics. We show that this question can be answered efficiently through semidefinite programming, which provides us with an operational and efficient way to quantify divisibility.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quantum Circuit Complexity via Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit complexity is a fundamental concept whose importance permeates quantum information, computation, many-body physics and high-energy physics. While extensively studied in closed systems, its characterization and behaviors in the widely important setting where the system is embedded within a larger one -- encompassing measurement-assisted state preparation -- lack systematic understanding. We introduce the notion of embedded complexity that characterizes the complexity of projected states and measurement operators in this general setting incorporating auxiliary systems and measurements. For random circuits and certain strongly interacting time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics, we show that the embedded complexity is lower-bounded by the circuit volume -- the total number of gates acting on both the subsystem and its complement. This strengthens the complexity linear growth theorems, enriches the understanding of deep thermalization, and indicates that measurement-assisted methods generically cannot yield significant advantages in state preparation cost, contrary to expectations. We further demonstrate a spacetime conversion of certain circuit models that concentrates circuit volume onto a subsystem, and showcase applications for random circuit sampling and shadow tomography. Our theory establishes a unified framework for space and time aspects of quantum circuit complexity, yielding profound new insights and applications across quantum information and physics.</description>

      <title>Design nearly optimal quantum algorithm for linear differential equations via Lindbladians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) is one of the most promising applications for quantum computers to demonstrate exponential advantages. The challenge of designing a quantum ODE algorithm is how to embed non-unitary dynamics into intrinsically unitary quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for solving ODEs by harnessing open quantum systems. Specifically, we propose a novel technique called non-diagonal density matrix encoding, which leverages the inherent non-unitary dynamics of Lindbladians to encode general linear ODEs into the non-diagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design quantum algorithms with both theoretical simplicity and high performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters under a plausible input model. We also give applications of our algorithm including the Gibbs state preparations and the partition function estimations.</description>

Abstract: Randomized measurements are useful for analyzing quantum systems especially when quantum control is not fully perfect. However, their practical realization typically requires multiple rotations in the complex space due to the adoption of random unitaries. Here, we introduce two simplified randomized measurements that limit rotations in a subspace of the complex space. The first is \textit{real randomized measurements} (RRMs) with orthogonal evolution and real local observables. The second is \textit{partial real randomized measurements} (PRRMs) with orthogonal evolution and imaginary local observables. We show that these measurement protocols exhibit different abilities in capturing correlations of bipartite systems. We explore various applications of RRMs and PRRMs in different quantum information tasks such as characterizing high-dimensional entanglement, quantum imaginarity, and predicting properties of quantum states with classical shadow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.</description>

Abstract: Diffraction of atoms from surfaces provides detailed insights into structures, interactions, and dynamical processes. However, currently the method is limited to measurements in reflection - diffraction through materials has only been demonstrated for subatomic particles and is an outstanding challenge for atoms. We diffract helium and hydrogen atoms at kiloelectronvolt energies through single-layer graphene at normal incidence. Despite the atoms' high kinetic energy as well as coupling to the electronic system of graphene, we observe coherent scattering. This preservation of coherence was the result of the limited momentum transfer between the projectile and the lattice, resulting from interaction times on the femtosecond scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon recent progress in Lindblad engineering for quantum Gibbs state preparation algorithms, we propose a simplified protocol that is shown to be efficient under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The ETH reduces circuit overheads of the Lindblad simulation algorithm and ensures a fast convergence toward the target Gibbs state. Moreover, we show that the realized Lindblad dynamics exhibits an inherent resilience against stochastic noise, opening up the path to a first demonstration on quantum computers. We complement our claims with numerical studies of the algorithm's convergence in various regimes of the mixed-field Ising model. In line with our predictions, we observe a mixing time scaling polynomially with system size when the ETH is satisfied. In addition, we assess the impact of algorithmic and hardware-induced errors on the algorithm's performance by carrying out quantum circuit simulations of our Lindblad simulation protocol with a local depolarizing noise model. This work bridges the gap between recent theoretical advances in dissipative Gibbs state preparation algorithms and their eventual quantum hardware implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and experimentally implement a real-time protocol for calibrating the frequency of a resonantly driven qubit, achieving exponential scaling in calibration precision with the number of measurements, up to the limit imposed by decoherence. The real-time processing capabilities of a classical controller dynamically generate adaptive probing sequences for qubit-frequency estimation. Each probing evolution time and drive frequency are calculated to divide the prior probability distribution into two branches, following a locally optimal strategy that mimics a conventional binary search. The scheme does not require repeated measurements at the same setting, as it accounts for state preparation and measurement errors. Its use of a parametrized probability distribution favors numerical accuracy and computational speed. We show the efficacy of the algorithm by stabilizing a flux-tunable transmon qubit, leading to improved coherence and gate fidelity. As benchmarked by gate-set tomography, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) powered control electronics partially mitigates non-Markovian noise, which is detrimental to quantum error correction. The mitigation is achieved by dynamically updating and feeding forward the qubit frequency. Our protocol highlights the importance of feedback in improving the calibration and stability of qubits subject to drift and can be readily applied to other qubit platforms.</description>

Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. We further show, using a perturbative approach that explicitly accounts for population dynamics, how the resulting switching dynamics can be observed and characterized in pump-probe experiments. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We analyse a decoherence effect, caused by the gravitational interaction between a massive body and the electromagnetic field. Assuming a quantum version of the light bending interaction, we show that it leads to decoherence of the mass if the light is not observed. Using the extreme weakness of the gravitational coupling, we derive explicitly the decoherence lengthscales for general states of the central mass and for both thermal and coherent light. Predictably, the effect is very faint for anything but hugely energetic light, however from the fundamental point of view of co-existence of both gravitation and quantum theories, it is there. Since effectively the studied system is a quantum optomechanical system, we hope our results, properly rescaled, will be also useful in optomechanics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for enhancing bipartite quantum entanglement in a double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system incorporating an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Utilizing a set of linearized quantum Langevin equations and numerical simulations, we investigate the impact of the OPA on both optical-vibration and vibration-vibration entanglement. Our key findings reveal a counterintuitive trade-off: while the OPA significantly enhances vibration-vibration entanglement, a critical resource for quantum memories and transducers, it simultaneously suppresses optical-vibration entanglement. We demonstrate that maximal vibration-vibration entanglement is achieved when the molecular collective vibrational modes are symmetrically populated, providing a clear experimental guideline for optimizing entanglement sources. In particular, the vibration-vibration entanglement generated in our OPA-enhanced McOM system exhibits remarkable robustness to thermal noise, persisting at temperatures approaching \SI{e3}{\kelvin}, significantly exceeding conventional optomechanical systems, and highlighting the potential for room temperature quantum information processing. These results establish a promising theoretical foundation for OPA-enhanced McOM systems as a robust and scalable platform for quantum technologies, paving the way for future experimental implementations and advanced quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Non-classical optimization of entangled photons through complex media</title>

Abstract: Optimization approaches are ubiquitous in physics. In optics, they are key to manipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from imaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the optimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to a purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical non-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the control and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs -- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence rate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained using classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state. Beyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential to tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with multi-spin interactions.</description>

      <title>A deep dive into the interplay of structured quantum peaked circuits and infinite temperature correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random quantum circuits have been extensively explored for quantum supremacy demonstrations. However, verifying their output distributions remains challenging. Here, we propose the infinite-temperature correlation function (ITCF) as a physically meaningful observable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices one that can be extracted using engineered circuits rather than relying on fully random constructions. This is realized by leveraging peaked quantum states whose probability distributions are sharply peaked at specific outcomes due to constructive interference thus offering more efficient verifiability and stronger signal observability. Rather than using Haar-random states, which often yield vanishing signals through destructive interference, we construct purposefully biased quantum states using either Grover-based amplitude amplification or shallow structured circuits. These engineered states amplify contributions from relevant operator subspaces, enabling robust detection of non-zero ITCF values that would otherwise be suppressed under random-state sampling. Our results highlight a problem-specific state preparation framework that mitigates signal loss from random averaging and facilitates the detection of physically meaningful observables in NISQ devices. We also discuss future extensions to multi-qubit observables, scrambling diagnostics, and variational circuit optimization, underscoring the broader potential of Peaked States for quantum simulation and verification.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm for performing quantum process tomography on an unknown $n$-qubit unitary $C$ from the Clifford group. Our algorithm uses Bell basis measurements to deterministically learn $C$ with $4n + 3$ queries, which is the asymptotically optimal query complexity. In contrast to previous algorithms that required access to $C^\dagger$ to achieve optimal query complexity, our algorithm achieves the same performance without querying $C^\dagger$. Additionally, we show the algorithm is robust to perturbations and can efficiently learn the closest Clifford to an unknown non-Clifford unitary $U$ using query overhead that is logarithmic in the number of qubits.</description>

Abstract: As quantum technologies advance, the security of popular cryptographic protocols becomes more threatened by the capabilities of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs). In this scenario, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has become a potential solution to prolong the life of existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems. However, PQC protocols depend on high-quality randomness for key generation and encapsulation procedures, with the quality of the entropy source potentially having a profound impact on the security of the overall system. In this work, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept enabling the incorporation of Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) devices within communication networks using PQC-based Transport Layer Security (TLS).Using open-source cryptographic libraries and commercial QRNG hardware, we demonstrate their use as entropy sources via an Entropy-as-a-Service (EaaS) model. We highlight two particular use cases: a fully virtualized private PKI network and a connection to an external PQC-enabled server. Experimental results show that EaaS QRNG enables real-time entropy monitoring and quality assessment in cryptographic management systems, with negligible impact on TLS handshake time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</description>

Abstract: Classical shallow networks are universal approximators. Given a sufficient number of neurons, they can reproduce any continuous function to arbitrary precision, with a resource cost that scales linearly in both the input size and the number of trainable parameters. In this work, we present a quantum optical protocol that implements a shallow network with an arbitrary number of neurons. Both the input data and the parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Leveraging the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, the network output is determined by the coincidence rates measured when the photons interfere at a beam splitter, with multiple neurons prepared as a mixture of single-photon states. Remarkably, once trained, our model requires constant optical resources regardless of the number of input features and neurons.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum of entangled photons as a probe for relativistic effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. We show that the joint OAM spectrum from entangled states is modified by length contraction when measured by two observers moving relative to the entanglement source. This relative motion rescales the spatial dimensions, thus breaking the orthogonality of the OAM measurement process and resulting in a broadening of the joint OAM spectrum that can precisely determine the Lorentz factor. We experimentally simulate velocities up to $0.99c$, confirm the predicted broadening, and use the measurement outcomes to extract the Lorentz factor. Our work provides a pathway for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that leverage OAM structured light as a resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving a practical quantum advantage for near-term applications is widely expected to rely on hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. To deliver this practical advantage to users, high performance computing (HPC) centers need to provide a suitable software and hardware stack that supports algorithms of this type. In this paper, we describe the world's first implementation of a classical-quantum environment in an HPC center that allows multiple users to execute hybrid algorithms on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) and GPUs. Our setup at the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PCSS) aligns with current HPC norms: the computing hardware including QPUs is installed in an active data center room with standard facilities; there are no special considerations for networking, power, and cooling; we use Slurm for workload management as well as the NVIDIA CUDA-Q extension API for classical-quantum interactions. We demonstrate applications of this environment for hybrid classical-quantum machine learning and optimisation. The aim of this work is to provide the community with an experimental example for further research and development on how quantum computing can practically enhance and extend HPC capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Neuroscientists face challenges in analyzing high-dimensional neural recording data of dense functional networks. Without ground-truth reference data, finding the best algorithm for recovering neurologically relevant networks remains an open question. We implemented hybrid quantum algorithms to construct functional networks and compared them with the results of documented classical techniques. We demonstrated that our quantum state fidelity methods can provide competitive alternatives to classical metrics by revealing distinct functional networks. Our results suggest that quantum computing offers a viable and potentially advantageous alternative for data-driven modeling in neuroscience, underscoring its broader applicability in high-dimensional graph inference and complex system analysis.</description>

      <title>Probing the Linewidth of the 12.4-keV Solid-State $^{45}$Sc Isomeric Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.</description>

      <title>Controlling the $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry Breaking Threshold in Bipartite Lattice Systems with Floquet Topological Edge States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the control of the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetry breaking threshold in a periodically driven one-dimensional dimerized lattice with spatially symmetric gain and loss defects. We elucidate the contrasting roles played by Floquet topological edge states in determining the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking threshold within the high- and low-frequency driving regimes. In the high-frequency regime, the participation of topological edge states in $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking is contingent upon the position of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric defect pairs, whereas in the low-frequency regime, their participation is unconditional and independent of the defect pairs placement, resulting in a universal zero threshold. We establish a direct link between the symmetry-breaking threshold and how the spatial profile of the Floquet topological edge states evolves over one driving period. We further demonstrate that lattices with an odd number of sites exhibit unique threshold patterns, in contrast to even-sized systems. Moreover, applying co-frequency periodic driving to the defect pairs, which preserves time-reversal symmetry, can significantly enhance the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-breaking threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Quantum Kinetic Treatment of Impact Ionization in Avalanche Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric quantities. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Toward a Consistent Definition of Holographic Entanglement Entropy in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new definition of holographic entanglement entropy in the framework of static patch holography for de Sitter space. Using the replica trick and twist operator formalism, we derive an entropy functional in three-dimensional de Sitter space expressed through de Sitter Green's functions. Since the naive Ryu-Takayanagi prescription in de Sitter spacetime fails to satisfy strong subadditivity, we demand that our proposed formula be consistent with the fundamental entropic inequalities. The resulting conditions place nontrivial constraints on the undetermined parameter space of static patch holography. Our results demonstrate that entanglement inequalities provide a sharp diagnostic for candidate definitions of entanglement entropy in de Sitter holography and offer quantitative evidence in support of static patch holography as a consistent framework.</description>
