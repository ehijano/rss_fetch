      <title>Advancing Understanding of Long COVID Pathophysiology Through Quantum Walk-Based Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long COVID is a multisystem condition characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and systemic inflammation, following COVID-19 infection, yet its mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we applied quantum walk (QW), a computational approach leveraging quantum interference, to explore large-scale SARS-CoV-2-induced protein (SIP) networks. Compared to the conventional random walk with restart (RWR) method, QW demonstrated superior capacity to traverse deeper regions of the network, uncovering proteins and pathways implicated in Long COVID. Key findings include mitochondrial dysfunction, thromboinflammatory responses, and neuronal inflammation as central mechanisms. QW uniquely identified the CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein family and VDAC1, a mitochondrial calcium transporter, as critical regulators of these processes. VDAC1 emerged as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, supported by FDA-approved compounds such as cannabidiol. These findings highlight QW as a powerful tool for elucidating complex biological systems and identifying novel therapeutic targets for conditions like Long COVID.</description>

      <title>Translating and evaluating single-cell Boolean network interventions in the multiscale setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracellular networks process cellular-level information and control cell fate. They can be computationally modeled using Boolean networks, which are implicit-time causal models of discrete binary events. These networks can be embedded in computational agents to drive cellular behavior. To explore this integration, we construct a set of candidate interventions that induce apoptosis in a cell-survival network of a rare leukemia using exhaustive search simulation, stable motif control, and an individual-based mean field approach (IBMFA). Due to inherent algorithmic limitations, these interventions are most suitable for cell-level determinations, not the more realistic multicellular setting. To address these limitations, we treat the target control solutions as putative targets for therapeutic interventions and develop a pipeline to translate them to continuous-time multicellular, agent-based models. We set the discrete-to-continuous transitions between the Boolean network and multicellular model via thresholding and produce simple computational simulations designed to emulate situations in experimental and translational biology. These include a series of simulations: constant substrate gradients, global substrate pulses, and time-varying boundary conditions. We find that interventions that perform equally well in the implicit-time single-cell setting are separable in the multiscale setting in ability to impact population growth and spatial distribution. Further analysis shows that the population and spatial distribution differences arise from differences in internal dynamics (stable motif controls versus target controls) and network distance between the intervention and output nodes. This proof of concept work demonstrates the importance of accounting for internal dynamics in multicellular simulations as well as impacts on understanding of Boolean network control.</description>

      <title>Balancing reaction-diffusion network for cell polarization pattern with stability and asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell polarization is a critical process that separates molecular species into two distinct regions in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, guiding biological processes such as cell division and cell differentiation. Although several underlying antagonistic reaction-diffusion networks capable of setting up cell polarization have been identified experimentally and theoretically, our understanding of how to manipulate pattern stability and asymmetry remains incomplete, especially when only a subset of network components are known. Here we present numerical results to show that the polarized pattern of an antagonistic 2-node network collapses into a homogeneous state when subjected to single-sided self-regulation, single-sided additional regulation, or unequal system parameters. However, polarity restoration can be achieved by combining two modifications with opposing effects. Additionally, spatially inhomogeneous parameters favoring respective domains stabilize their interface at designated locations. To connect our findings to cell polarity studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, we reconstituted a 5-node network where a 4-node circuit with full mutual inhibitions between anterior and posterior is modified by a mutual activation in the anterior and an additional mutual inhibition between the anterior and the posterior. Once again, a generic set of kinetic parameters moves the interface towards either the anterior or posterior end, yet a polarized pattern can be stabilized through spatial tuning of one or more parameters coupled to intracellular or extracellular cues. A user-friendly software, PolarSim, is introduced to facilitate the exploration of networks with alternative node numbers, parameter values, and regulatory pathways.</description>

      <title>Simple Proofs of the Summation and Connectivity Theorems in Metabolic Control Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the early 1970s, the Kacser/Burns and the Heinrich/Rapoport groups independently discovered the important summation and connectivity theorems in metabolic control analysis. These theorems were derived originally by using thought experiments and proved mathematically later. The mathematical proofs are not easy for me to read and follow. But the proofs actually can be very simple and need only a couple of lines as I give here.</description>

      <title>Computationally Checking if a Reaction Network is Monotone or Non-expansive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure for testing whether reaction networks exhibit non-expansivity or monotonicity. This procedure identifies explicit norms under which a network is non-expansive or cones for which the system is monotone-or provides proof that no such structures exist. Our approach reproduces known results, generates novel findings, and demonstrates that certain reaction networks cannot exhibit monotonicity or non-expansivity with respect to any cone or norm. Additionally, we establish a duality relationship which states that if a network is monotone, so is its dual network.</description>
