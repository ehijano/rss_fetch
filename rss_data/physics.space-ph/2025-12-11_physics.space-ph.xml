      <title>Tether-Based Architecture for Solar-Powered Orbital AI Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tether-based structural architecture for orbital data centers operating in Dawn-Dusk Sun-Synchronous (DDSS) orbits under continuous sunlight. These space-based data centers, powered solely by solar energy, could provide multi-megawatt computing for artificial intelligence (AI) inference with minimal latency to Earth. The proposed design uses a tethered chain of computing nodes with photovoltaic panels to achieve uninterrupted 2-20 MW of computing power, and employs radiative cooling and integrated shielding to manage heat and radiation. We detail the system architecture, including mass budgets, passive attitude control, and the dynamics induced by micrometeoroid collisions.</description>

      <title>The skin effect in anomalous transport of charged particles in plasma with a microturbulent magnetic field. I. Isotropic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of electromagnetic skin effect on anomalous charged particle transport in dense, non-relativistic, collisionless plasma with a small-scale turbulent magnetic field was investigated using quasi-linear kinetic equations, through both analytical and numerical methods. Analytical expressions for the diffusion tensor components in the Fokker-Planck equation that take this effect into account have been found. The equation was solved numerically in the case of magnetostatic turbulence. It has been demonstrated that the skin effect increases the mean free path of particles in turbulent plasma, thereby reducing its anomalous resistance. It also leads to anisotropy in particle scattering, resulting in anisotropy in their stationary velocity distribution, which increases as the screening parameter grows. Approximate analytical formulas for the effective mobility of charged particles and the electric conductivity of plasma with isotropic magnetostatic turbulence have been obtained.</description>

      <title>Predicting CME Arrivals with Heliospheric Imagers from L5: A Data Assimilation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission has laid a foundation for advancing real-time space weather forecasting by enabling the evaluation of heliospheric imager (HI) data for predicting coronal mass ejection (CME) arrivals at Earth. This study employs the ELEvoHI model to assess how incorporating STEREO/HI data from the Lagrange 5 (L5) perspective can enhance prediction accuracy for CME arrival times and speeds. Our investigation, preparing for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from beyond 35{\deg} elongation are used. These findings pave the way for optimising real-time prediction methodologies, providing valuable groundwork for the forthcoming Vigil mission and enhancing preparedness for CME-driven space weather events.</description>

      <title>Damped Kinetic Alfv\'en Waves in Earth's Magnetosheath: Numerical Simulations and MMS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's magnetosheath provides a high $\beta$ (ratio of electron thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) plasma environment where kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAWs) strongly influence turbulence and energy dissipation. This study investigates how Landau damping modifies the nonlinear evolution of KAWs by solving a modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that captures both dispersive and nonlinear effects. Without Landau damping, modulational instability drives rapid self-focusing into intense magnetic filaments, producing a turbulent cascade with $k_\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling in the inertial range ($k_\perp\rho_i&lt;1$) that transitions to $k_\perp^{-8/3}$ at sub-ion scales ($k_\perp\rho_i&gt;1$), here $k_\perp$ is the wavevector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field and $\rho_i$ the ion thermal gyroradius. When Landau damping is included, magnetic structures are significantly suppressed, and the spectrum steepens to $k_\perp^{-11/3}$ in the sub-ion range while the inertial range maintains $k_\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling. The damping acts across all scales through resonant wave-particle interactions, efficiently transferring energy from waves to particles. Direct comparison with Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations shows that the observed kinetic range spectral slope falls between our undamped and damped simulation limits, consistent with an intermediate damping regime in magnetosheath turbulence. This agreement confirms that Landau damping is one of the primary mechanisms controlling turbulent energy dissipation at kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Alfv\'en waves in the temperature anisotropic space plasma with a kappa-Maxwellian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersion and damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves are studied in temperature anisotropic space plasma with kappa-Maxwellian distribution. Employing a kinetic approach, the wave frequency and damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves and the modified ion acoustic waves are derived in a low \b{eta} plasma, which both depend on the parameters \k{appa} and . The numerical analyses show that the wave frequency of kinetic Alfv\'en waves is larger in kappa-Maxwellian plasma than that in Maxwellian case. The wave frequency of the modified ion acoustic waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is larger in the short-wave region but smaller in the long-wave region than that in Maxwellian case. Again, we found that the damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is stronger than that in Maxwellian case. The damping rate of modified ion acoustic waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is stronger in the short-wave region but weaker in the long-wave region than that in Maxwellian case. The impact of the parameter on the two modes is relatively small because we consider the low \b{eta} case. These results are helpful for us to understand better the characteristics of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in space plasma.</description>

      <title>Firehose instability in the space plasma with anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the electron firehose mode propagating parallel to the ambient magnetic field in the space plasma with anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons. The dispersion relation, the wave frequency and the growth rate of electron firehose mode are derived, and the condition for onset of the firehose instability is obtained. We show that the wave frequency and the growth rate both depend significantly on the parameters, such as the parallel electron beta , the nonthermal parameter {\Lambda} and the electron temperature anisotropy Ae , and the anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons change the instability condition. The numerical analyses show that the wave frequency and the growth rate of the electron firehose mode increase with increase of the parameters. The results may be helpful for understanding the firehose instability in space plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Ion-acoustic shock and solitary waves in magnetized plasma with Cairns-Gurevich distribution electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The propagation properties of ion-acoustic solitary and shock waves in the magnetized viscous plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons are investigated. The Cairns-Gurevich distribution as the electron distribution is considered to describe the plasma nonthermality and particle trapping. By adopting the reductive perturbation technique, we derived the nonlinear Schamel-Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (SKdVB) equation, and then obtained the ion-acoustic shock and solitary wave solutions of the SKdVB equation for different limiting cases. It is found that the impact of nonthermal parameter {\alpha}, external magnetic field {\Omega}, obliqueness lz, wave speed U0, and the ion kinematic viscosity {\eta}0 can significantly change the characteristics of the shock and solitary waves. These results may be useful for better understanding the propagation of nonlinear structures in space (i.e. Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere, auroral regions) and laboratory plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons.</description>
