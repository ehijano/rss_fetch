      <title>Compensation of Coarse Quantization Effects on Channel Estimation and BER in Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resolution quantization is essential to reduce implementation cost and power consumption in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for 5G and 6G. While most existing studies assume perfect channel state information (CSI), we model the impact of coarse quantization noise on both channel estimation and data transmission, yielding a more realistic assessment of system performance under imperfect CSI conditions in the uplink. We develop a tight approximation for the bit-error ratio (BER) of uncoded M-QAM with zero-forcing detection, based on the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) channel estimate. These analytical results enable compensation strategies that jointly optimize quantization resolution, transmit power, and pilot length across different numbers of users and base station antennas. We further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework through several design scenarios that highlight its effectiveness in optimizing system parameters and improving energy efficiency under quantization constraints. For example, in a 16-QAM system, extending the pilot sequence by 2.5 times and lowering transmit power by 0.5 dB enables a 3-bit quantized system to match the BER of the full-resolution case. The proposed framework offers a fast and accurate alternative to Monte Carlo simulations, enabling practical system optimization under realistic quantization constraints.</description>

      <title>Janus Metasurface Breaking Polarization Symmetry: Surface-Modulated Electromagnetic Wave Radiation with Coexistent Linear and Circular Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a Janus metasurface based tensor impedance holographic antenna (JHA) is proposed that simultaneously radiates linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) beams from a single aperture excited by a single feed. The proposed design introduces modified tensor impedance equations to significantly reduce cross-polarization at higher radiation angles. It demonstrates broadband operation bandwidth of 0.5 GHz while maintaining high circular polarization purity. The design methodology is verified using aperture field integration theory, ensuring that the impedance distribution produces the desired far-field radiation patterns. Prototypes of three variations of the holographic antenna are fabricated, validating its performance. The radiation characteristics of the proposed antenna make it an attractive choice for advanced broadband communication applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Joint Time and Power Management in SWIPT-EH CIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for joint time allocation and power control in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The CIoT transmitter autonomously manages energy harvesting (EH) and transmissions using a learnable time switching factor while optimizing power to enhance throughput and lifetime. The joint optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process under small-scale fading, realistic EH, and interference constraints. We develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN) enhanced with an upper confidence bound. Simulations benchmark our approach, showing superior performance over existing DRL methods.</description>

      <title>CF-Net: A Cross-Feature Reconstruction Network for High-Accuracy 1-Bit Target Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target classification is a fundamental task in radar systems, and its performance critically depends on the quantization precision of the signal. While high-precision quantization (e.g. 16-bit) is well established, 1-bit quantization offers distinct advantages by enabling direct sampling at high frequencies and eliminating complex intermediate stages. However, its extreme quantization leads to significant information loss. Although higher sampling rates can compensate for this loss, such oversampling is impractical at the high frequencies targeted for direct sampling. To achieve high-accuracy classification directly from 1-bit radar data under the same sampling rate, this paper proposes a novel two-stage deep learning framework, CF-Net. First, we introduce a self-supervised pre-training strategy based on a dual-branch U-Net architecture. This network learns to restore high-fidelity 16-bit images from their 1-bit counterparts via a cross-feature reconstruction task, forcing the 1-bit encoder to learn robust features despite extreme quantization. Subsequently, this pre-trained encoder is repurposed and fine-tuned for the downstream multi-class target classification task. Experiments on two radar target datasets demonstrate that CF-Net can effectively extract discriminative features from 1-bit imagery, achieving comparable and even superior accuracy to some 16-bit methods without oversampling.</description>

      <title>Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Joint Link Selection and Trajectory Optimization in SAGIN-Supported UAV Mobility Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the significant variations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) altitude and horizontal mobility, it becomes difficult for any single network to ensure continuous and reliable threedimensional coverage. Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Alzheimer's Detection through Late Fusion of Multi-Modal EEG Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, where early detection is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming and require expert interpretation, thus, automated approaches are highly desirable. This study presents a novel deep learning framework for AD diagnosis using Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals, integrating multiple feature extraction techniques including alpha-wave analysis, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Markov Transition Fields (MTF). A late-fusion strategy is employed to combine predictions from separate neural networks trained on these diverse representations, capturing both temporal and frequency-domain patterns in the EEG data. The proposed model attains a classification accuracy of 87.23%, with a precision of 87.95%, a recall of 86.91%, and an F1 score of 87.42% when evaluated on a publicly available dataset, demonstrating its potential for reliable, scalable, and early AD screening. Rigorous preprocessing and targeted frequency band selection, particularly in the alpha range due to its cognitive relevance, further enhance performance. This work highlights the promise of deep learning in supporting physicians with efficient and accessible tools for early AD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Dataset and UAV Propagation Channel Modeling for LoRa in the 860 MHz ISM Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRa is one of the most widely used low-power wide-area network technology for the Internet of Things. To achieve long-range communication with low power consumption at a low cost, LoRa uses a chirp spread spectrum modulation and transmits in the sub-GHz unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands. Due to the rapid densification of IoT networks, it is crucial to obtain tailored channel models to evaluate the performance of LoRa networks. While channel models for cellular technologies have been investigated extensively, specific characteristics of LoRa transmissions operating at long range with a rather small (~ 250kHz) bandwidth require dedicated measurement campaigns and modeling efforts. In this work, we leverage an SDR-based testbed to gather and publish a dataset of LoRa frames transmitted in a campus environment. The dataset includes IQ samples of the received frames at multiple locations and allows for the evaluation of channel variations with high time resolution. Using the gathered data, we derive empirical propagation channel models for LoRa that include receiver correlation over distance for three scenarios: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) line-of-sight (LoS), UAV non-LoS, and pedestrian non-LoS. Furthermore, the dataset is annotated with synchronization information, enabling the evaluation of receiver algorithms using experimental data.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Phase Shift Optimization of Liquid Crystal RIS in Dynamic mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance coverage and signal quality in millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a game-changing solution to manipulate the wireless environment. Traditional semiconductor-based RISs face scalability issues due to high power consumption. Meanwhile, liquid crystal-based RISs (LC-RISs) offer energy-efficient and cost-effective operation even for large arrays. However, this promise has a caveat. LC-RISs suffer from long reconfiguration times, on the order of tens of milliseconds, which limits their applicability in dynamic scenarios. To date, prior works have focused on hardware design aspects or static scenarios to address this limitation, but little attention has been paid to optimization solutions for dynamic settings. Our paper fills this gap by proposing a reinforcement learning-based optimization framework to dynamically control the phase shifts of LC-RISs and maximize the data rate of a moving user. Specifically, we propose a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm that adapts the LC-RIS phase shifts without requiring perfect channel state information and balances the tradeoff between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and configuration time. We validate our approach through high-fidelity ray tracing simulations, leveraging measurement data from an LC-RIS prototype. Our results demonstrate the potential of our solution to bring adaptive control to dynamic LC-RIS-assisted mmWave systems.</description>

      <title>Moment-Matching Array Processing Technique for diffuse source estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation is a fundamental problem in signal processing. Diffuse sources, whose power density cannot be represented with a single angular coordinate, are usually characterized based on prior assumptions, which associate the source angular density with a specific set of functions. However, these assumptions can lead to significant estimation biases when they are incorrect. This paper introduces the Moment-Matching Estimation Technique (MoMET), a low-complexity method for estimating the mean DOA, spread, and power of a narrow diffuse source without requiring prior knowledge on the source distribution. The unknown source density is characterized by its mean DOA and its first central moments, which are estimated through covariance matching techniques which fit the empirical covariance of the measurements to that modeled from the moments. The MoMET parameterization is robust to incorrect model assumptions, and numerically efficient. The asymptotic bias and covariance of the new estimator are derived and its performance is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Performance of Diagonally Loaded Detectors for Large Arrays: To Achieve CFAR and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two critical limitations in diagonally loaded (DL) adaptive matched filter (AMF) detector: (1) the lack of CFAR property with respect to arbitrary covariance matrices, and (2) the absence of selection criteria for optimal loading factor from the perspective of maximizing the detection probability (Pd). We provide solutions to both challenges through a comprehensive analysis for the asymptotic performance of DL-AMF under large dimensional regime (LDR) where the dimension N and sample size K tend to infinity whereas their ratio N/K converges to a constant c\in(0,1). The analytical results show that any DL detectors constructed by normalizing the random variable |a|2=|sH(R+{\lambda}IN)-1y0|2 with a deterministic quantity or a random variable that converges almost surely to a deterministic value will exhibit equivalent performance under LDR. Following this idea, we derive two CFAR DL detectors: CFAR DL semi-clairvoyant matched filter (CFAR-DL-SCMF) detector and CFAR DL adaptive matched filter (CFAR-DL-AMF) detector, by normalizing |a|2 with an appropriate deterministic quantity and its consistent estimate, respectively. The theoretical analysis and simulations show that both CFAR-DL-SCMF and CFAR-DL-AMF achieve CFAR with respect to covariance matrix, target steering vector and loading factor. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotically optimal loading factor \lambda_opt by maximizing the explicit expression of asymptotic Pd. For practical implementation, we provide a consistent estimator for \lambda_opt under LDR. Based on \lambda_opt and its consistent estimate, we establish the optimal CFAR-DL-SCMF (opt-CFAR-DL-SCMF) and the optimal CFAR-DL-AMF (opt-CFAR-DL-AMF). Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed opt-CFAR-DL-SCMF and opt-CFAR-DL-AMF consistently outperform EL-AMF and persymmetric AMF in both full-rank and low-rank clutter plus noise environments.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Joint Channel and Symbol Estimation for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a recent architecture in which scattering elements are interconnected to enhance the degrees of freedom for wave control, yielding performance gains over traditional single-connected RISs. For BD-RIS, channel estimation - well-studied for conventional RIS - becomes more challenging due to the complex connections and a larger number of coefficients. Prior works rely on pilot-assisted estimation followed by data decoding. This paper introduces a semi-blind tensor-based approach for joint channel and symbol estimation that eliminates the need for training sequences by leveraging data symbols directly. A practical scenario with time-varying user terminal-RIS channels under mobility is considered. By reformulating the received signal from a tensor decomposition perspective, we develop two semi-blind receivers: a two-stage method transforming the fourth-order PARATUCK model into a third-order PARAFAC model, and a single-stage iterative process based on fourth-order TUCKER decomposition. Identifiability conditions for reliable joint recovery are derived, and numerical results demonstrate the performance advantages and trade-offs of the proposed schemes over existing solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter casts the problem of optimum discrete beamforming as the computation of the Minkowski sum of convex polygons, which is itself a convex polygon. The number of vertices of the latter is at most the sum of the number of vertices of the original polygons, enabling its efficient computation. This original and intuitive formulation confirms that the optimum beamforming solution can be found efficiently.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for EH-Enabled Cognitive-IoT Under Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating cognitive radio (CR) has become a practical solution to address the challenge of spectrum scarcity, leading to the development of cognitive IoT (CIoT). However, the vulnerability of radio communications makes radio jamming attacks a key concern in CIoT networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach designed to optimize throughput and extend network lifetime of an energy-constrained CIoT system under jamming attacks. This DRL framework equips a CIoT device with the autonomy to manage energy harvesting (EH) and data transmission, while also regulating its transmit power to respect spectrum-sharing constraints. We formulate the optimization problem under various constraints, and we model the CIoT device's interactions within the channel as a model-free Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP serves as a foundation to develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN), designed to help the CIoT agent learn the optimal communication policy to navigate challenges such as dynamic channel occupancy, jamming attacks, and channel fading while achieving its goal. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, named UCB-IA, which enhances the CIoT network's ability to efficiently navigate jamming attacks within the channel. The proposed DRL algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge and uses locally observable information such as channel occupancy, jamming activity, channel gain, and energy arrival to make decisions. Extensive simulations prove that our proposed DRL algorithm that utilizes the UCB-IA strategy surpasses existing benchmarks, allowing for a more adaptive, energy-efficient, and secure spectrum sharing in CIoT networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce O-EENC-SD: an end-to-end online speaker diarization system based on EEND-EDA, featuring a novel RNN-based stitching mechanism for online prediction. In particular, we develop a novel centroid refinement decoder whose usefulness is assessed through a rigorous ablation study. Our system provides key advantages over existing methods: a hyperparameter-free solution compared to unsupervised clustering approaches, and a more efficient alternative to current online end-to-end methods, which are computationally costly. We demonstrate that O-EENC-SD is competitive with the state of the art in the two-speaker conversational telephone speech domain, as tested on the CallHome dataset. Our results show that O-EENC-SD provides a great trade-off between DER and complexity, even when working on independent chunks with no overlap, making the system extremely efficient.</description>

      <title>A Blind Source Separation Framework to Monitor Sectoral Power Demand from Grid-Scale Load Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we are moving towards decentralized power systems dominated by intermittent electricity generation from renewable energy sources, demand-side flexibility is becoming a critical issue. In this context, it is essential to understand the composition of electricity demand at various scales of the power grid. At the regional or national scale, there is however little visibility on the relative contributions of different consumer categories, due to the complexity and costs of collecting end-users consumption data. To address this issue, we propose a blind source separation framework based on a constrained variant of non-negative matrix factorization to monitor the consumption of residential, services and industrial sectors at high frequency from aggregate high-voltage grid load measurements. Applying the method to Italy's national load curve between 2021 and 2023, we reconstruct accurate hourly consumption profiles for each sector. Results reveal that both households and services daily consumption behaviors are driven by two distinct regimes related to the season and day type whereas industrial demand follows a single, stable daily profile. Besides, the monthly consumption estimates of each sector derived from the disaggregated load are found to closely align with sample-based indices and be more precise than forecasting approaches based on these indices for real-time monitoring.</description>

      <title>Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Phase Information on Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance of rotating machinery increasingly relies on vibration signals, yet most learning-based approaches either discard phase during spectral feature extraction or use raw time-waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase information. This paper introduces two phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\% accuracy (+5.4\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships. These findings establish both phase alignment strategies as practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of Machine Learning Models for Fault Classification and Localization In Power System Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.
  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Radio Localization: A Channel Charting-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel charting creates a low-dimensional representation of the radio environment in a self-supervised manner using manifold learning. Preserving relative spatial distances in the latent space, channel charting is well suited to support user localization. While prior work on channel charting has mainly focused on two-dimensional scenarios, real-world environments are inherently three-dimensional. In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting. For the second scenario, we introduce multistory channel charting, a two-stage approach consisting of floor classification via clustering followed by the training of a dedicated expert neural network for channel charting on each individual floor, thereby enhancing the channel charting performance. In addition, we propose a novel feature engineering method designed to extract sparse features from the beamspace channel state information that are suitable for localization.</description>

      <title>Reducing Pilots in Channel Estimation With Predictive Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is essential for modern wireless systems, which becomes increasingly difficult under large antenna arrays, strict pilot overhead constraints, and diverse deployment environments. Existing artificial intelligence-based solutions often lack robustness and fail to generalize across scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a predictive-foundation-model-based channel estimation framework that enables accurate, low-overhead, and generalizable CSI acquisition. The proposed framework employs a predictive foundation model trained on large-scale cross-domain CSI data to extract universal channel representations and provide predictive priors with strong cross-scenario transferability. A pilot processing network based on a vision transformer architecture is further designed to capture spatial, temporal, and frequency correlations from pilot observations. An efficient fusion mechanism integrates predictive priors with real-time measurements, enabling reliable CSI reconstruction even under sparse or noisy conditions. Extensive evaluations across diverse configurations demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms both classical and data-driven baselines in accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Persistent feature reconstruction of resident space objects (RSOs) within inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Detection of Performance Interference Among Network Slices in 5G/6G Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies showed that network slices (NSs), which are logical networks supported by shared physical networks, can experience service interference due to sharing of physical and virtual resources. Thus, from the perspective of providing end-to-end (E2E) service quality assurance in 5G/6G systems, it is crucial to discover possible service interference among existing NSs in a timely manner and isolate the potential issues before they can lead to violations of service quality agreements. We study the problem of (a) detecting service interference among NSs in 5G/6G systems and (b) identifying misbehaving NSs and other affected NSs, only using E2E key performance indicator measurements, and propose new algorithms. Our numerical studies demonstrate that, even when the service interference among NSs is weak to moderate, provided that a reasonable number of measurements are available, the proposed algorithms can correctly identify most of shared resources that can lead to service interference among the NSs that utilize the shared resources and misbehaving NSs that can cause potentially adverse service interference and affected NSs.</description>

      <title>MTLoc: A Confidence-Based Source-Free Domain Adaptation Approach For Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various deep learning models have been developed for indoor localization based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. However, they often require adaptation to ensure accurate tracking in new target operational domains. To address this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been proposed to align pre-trained models with data from target environments. However, they rely on large annotated datasets from the initial domain (source). Source data access is limited by privacy, storage, computational, and transfer constraints. Although many source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods address these constraints in classification, applying them to regression models for localization remains challenging. Indeed, target datasets for indoor localization are typically small, with few features and samples, and are noisy. Adapting regression models requires high-confidence target pseudo-annotation to avoid over-training. In this paper, a specialized mean-teacher method called MTLoc is proposed for SFDA. MTLoc updates the student network using noisy data and teacher-generated pseudo-labels. The teacher network maintains stability through exponential moving averages. To further ensure robustness, the teacher's pseudo-labels are refined using k-nearest neighbor correction. MTLoc allows for self-supervised learning on target data, facilitating effective adaptation to dynamic and noisy indoor environments. Validated using real-world data from our experimental setup with INLAN Inc., our results show that MTLoc achieves high localization accuracy under challenging conditions, significantly reducing localization error compared to baselines, including the state-of-the-art adversarial UDA approach with access to source data.</description>

Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation, compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources are reallocated to high-noise sensors.</description>

      <title>OpenDPDv2: A Unified Learning and Optimization Framework for Neural Network Digital Predistortion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based Digital Predistortion (DPD) has demonstrated superior performance in improving signal quality in wideband radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) employing complex modulation. However, NN DPDs usually rely on a large number of parameters for effective linearization and can significantly contribute to the energy consumption of the digital back-end in RF systems. This paper presents OpenDPDv2, an open-source, end-to-end framework that unifies PA modeling, NN-DPD learning, and deployment-oriented model optimization to reduce inference energy while preserving linearization performance. OpenDPDv2 introduces TRes-DeltaGRU, a delta-RNN DPD architecture with a lightweight temporal residual path that improves robustness under aggressive temporal sparsity, and it supports joint optimization of temporal sparsity and fixed-point quantization. On a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty PA driven by a TM3.1a 200 MHz 256-QAM OFDM signal, the FP32 TRes-DeltaGRU model achieves ACPR of -59.9 dBc and EVM of -42.1 dB. By combining quantization with dynamic temporal sparsity, the model reduces inference energy by 4.5x while maintaining -51.8 dBc ACPR and -35.2 dB EVM at 56% temporal sparsity. Code, datasets, and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/lab-emi/OpenDPD.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Indoor Positioning with a Single LED and Distributed Single-Element OIRS: An Iterative Approach with Adaptive Beam Steering</title>

Abstract: The integration of Optical Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (OIRSs) into Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is gaining momentum as a valid alternative to RF technologies, harnessing the existing lighting infrastructures and the vast unlicensed optical spectrum to enable higher spectral efficiency, improved resilience to Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockages, and enhanced positioning capabilities. This paper investigates the problem of localizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment consisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and multiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem within an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first, the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to prevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the ML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise variance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of estimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization algorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose weights are set according to the inverse of the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network to dynamically align with the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position. Accordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance estimation and PD position estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of localization accuracy, robustness against OIRSs misalignment conditions, and low number of iterations required to attain the theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Land-to-Ship Maritime Wireless Channels at 5.8 GHz</title>

Abstract: Maritime channel modeling is crucial for designing robust nearshore communication systems, yet reliable models that account for the dynamic marine environment with varying sea waves, wind conditions, and vessel motions remain scarce. This article investigates land-to-ship maritime wireless channel characteristics at 5.8 GHz based upon an extensive measurement campaign, with concurrent hydrological and meteorological information collection. First, a novel large-scale path loss model with physical foundation and high accuracy is proposed for dynamic marine environments. Then, we introduce the concept of sea-wave-induced fixed-point (SWIFT) fading, a peculiar phenomenon in maritime scenarios that captures the impact of sea surface fluctuations on received power. An enhanced two-ray model incorporating vessel rotational motion is propounded to simulate the SWIFT fading, showing good alignment with measured data, particularly for modest antenna movements. Next, the small-scale fading is studied by leveraging a variety of models including the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) and asymmetric Laplace distributions, with the latter performing well in most cases, while TWDP better captures bimodal fading in rough seas. Furthermore, maritime channel sparsity is examined via the Gini index and Rician $K$ factor, and temporal dispersion is characterized. The resulting channel models and parameter characteristics offer valuable insights for maritime wireless system design and deployment.</description>

      <title>Performance Bounds of Near-Field Velocity Estimation with Modular Linear Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Velocity estimation is a cornerstone of the recently introduced near-field predictive beamforming. This paper derives the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint radial and transverse velocity estimation within a predictive beamforming framework employing a modular linear array (MLA). We obtain closed-form expressions that characterize the interplay between array geometry and estimation accuracy, showing that increasing the inter-module separation enlarges the effective aperture and reduces the transverse-velocity CRB, while the radial-velocity CRB remains largely insensitive to this separation. Furthermore, we show that an MLA can achieve the same accuracy as a collocated ULA with fewer antennas and quantify the relation between inter-module spacing and antenna savings. The derived expressions are validated through simulations by comparing them with the mean-squared error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Pipeline Stage Resolved Timing Characterization of FPGA and ASIC Implementations of a RISC V Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline stage resolved timing characterization of a 32-bit RISC V processor implemented on a 20 nm FPGA and a 7 nm FinFET ASIC platform. A unified analysis framework is introduced that decomposes timing paths into logic, routing, and clocking components and maps them to well-defined pipeline stage transitions. This approach enables systematic comparison of timing behavior across heterogeneous implementation technologies at a microarchitectural level. Using static timing analysis and statistical characterization, the study shows that although both implementations exhibit dominant critical paths in the EX to MEM pipeline transition, their underlying timing mechanisms differ fundamentally. FPGA timing is dominated by routing parasitics and placement dependent variability, resulting in wide slack distributions and sensitivity to routing topology. In contrast, ASIC timing is governed primarily by combinational logic depth and predictable parametric variation across process, voltage, and temperature corners, yielding narrow and stable timing distributions. The results provide quantitative insight into the structural origins of timing divergence between programmable and custom fabrics and demonstrate the effectiveness of pipeline stage resolved analysis for identifying platform specific bottlenecks. Based on these findings, the paper derives design implications for achieving predictable timing closure in processor architectures targeting both FPGA and ASIC implementations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</description>

      <title>Efficiency vs. Efficacy: Assessing the Compression Ratio-Dice Score Relationship through a Simple Benchmarking Framework for Cerebrovascular 3D Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the community.</description>
