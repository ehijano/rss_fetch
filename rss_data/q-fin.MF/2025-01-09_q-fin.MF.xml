      <title>From elephant to goldfish (and back): memory in stochastic Volterra processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new theoretical framework that exploits convolution kernels to transform a Volterra path-dependent (non-Markovian) stochastic process into a standard (Markovian) diffusion process. This transformation is achieved by embedding a Markovian "memory process" within the dynamics of the non-Markovian process. We discuss existence and path-wise regularity of solutions for the stochastic Volterra equations introduced and we provide a financial application to volatility modeling. We also propose a numerical scheme for simulating the processes. The numerical scheme exhibits a strong convergence rate of 1/2, which is independent of the roughness parameter of the volatility process. This is a significant improvement compared to Euler schemes used in similar models.
  We propose a new theoretical framework that exploits convolution kernels to transform a Volterra path-dependent (non-Markovian) stochastic process into a standard (Markovian) diffusion process. This transformation is achieved by embedding a Markovian "memory process" (the goldfish) within the dynamics of the non-Markovian process (the elephant). Most notably, it is also possible to go back, i.e., the transformation is reversible. We discuss existence and path-wise regularity of solutions for the stochastic Volterra equations introduced and we propose a numerical scheme for simulating the processes, which exhibits a remarkable convergence rate of $1/2$. In particular, in the fractional kernel case, the strong convergence rate is independent of the roughness parameter, which is a positive novelty in contrast with what happens in the available Euler schemes in the literature in rough volatility models.</description>

      <title>Growth rate of liquidity provider's wealth in G3Ms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how trading fees and continuous-time arbitrage affect the profitability of liquidity providers (LPs) in Geometric Mean Market Makers (G3Ms). We use stochastic reflected diffusion processes to analyze the dynamics of a G3M model under the arbitrage-driven market. Our research focuses on calculating LP wealth and extends the findings of Tassy and White related to the constant product market maker (Uniswap v2) to a wider range of G3Ms, including Balancer. This allows us to calculate the long-term expected logarithmic growth of LP wealth, offering new insights into the complex dynamics of AMMs and their implications for LPs in decentralized finance.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin Calculus Approach to Backward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the solutions to multi-dimensional backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs), whose (possibly random) generator reflects nonlinear dependence on both the solution process and the martingale integrand component of the adapted solutions, as well as their diagonal processes. The well-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which renders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes while contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semi-linear partial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of BSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize dynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment opportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands being identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.</description>
