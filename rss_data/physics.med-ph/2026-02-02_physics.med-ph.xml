      <title>Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>PPG-Based Heart Rate Accuracy in Diverse Populations: Investigating Inequities Across Body Composition and Skin Tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable devices are widely used for heart rate (HR) monitoring, yet their accuracy across diverse body compositions and skin tones remains uncertain. This study evaluated four wrist worn devices (Apple, Fitbit, Samsung, Garmin) in 58 Hispanic adults with Fitzpatrick skin types III to V during a cycling protocol alternating moderate (0.64 to 0.76 HRmax) and vigorous (0.77 to 0.95 HRmax) intensities. Criterion HR was obtained using a Polar H10 ECG, and accuracy was assessed using mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), bias, and intraclass correlation coefficients. All devices showed significant deviation from criterion measures. Apple and Garmin demonstrated the lowest error, whereas Fitbit and Samsung exhibited greater inaccuracies. Higher BMI and darker skin tones were associated with increased MAPE. These biases disproportionately affect higher risk populations, underscoring the need for improved algorithms to ensure equitable health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Body Fat, Skin Tone, and the Accuracy of Smartwatch Caloric Expenditure Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartwatches are widely used to estimate caloric expenditure for weight management, clinical decision making, and public health monitoring. These devices combine photoplethysmography, accelerometry, and proprietary algorithms. However, prior studies report substantial error, and the influence of moderators such as skin tone and body fat percentage (BF) remains underexamined. This study tested whether smartwatch brand, BF, and Fitzpatrick skin type (III to V) predict caloric expenditure error relative to indirect calorimetry. Fifty eight Hispanic adults completed a single laboratory visit including a ten minute recumbent cycling protocol with alternating two minute moderate and vigorous intensity intervals, bracketed by rest and recovery. Participants wore four consumer devices: Apple Watch Series 8, Fitbit Sense 2, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, and Garmin Forerunner 955. Energy expenditure was measured using a COSMED K5 metabolic system. After device specific data quality filtering, valid participant device pairings ranged from 44 to 52 per brand. One sample tests showed significant mean bias for three devices: Apple, Garmin, and Samsung. Fitbit showed no significant overall bias, although this depended on device specific outlier removal. Mean bias varied by brand, with Garmin and Samsung showing the largest overestimations. Mixed effects models revealed significant effects of device and BF, as well as a device by BF interaction, with physical activity energy expenditure error increasing as adiposity increased. Overall, common smartwatches substantially misestimate caloric expenditure compared with indirect calorimetry. Error varies by brand and worsens with higher body fat, highlighting limitations of current consumer wearables and the need for improved accuracy across diverse body types.</description>

      <title>Combining quasi-static and high frequency experiments for the viscoelastic characterization of brain tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical models of brain tissue are a beneficial tool to simulate neurosurgical interventions, disease progression, or brain development. However, the accuracy and predictive capacity of such a model relies on a precise experimental characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior. Such a characterization is yet limited by inconsistent or contradictory experimental responses reported in the literature, particularly when measurements are performed in different time or length scales. Although brain tissue has been extensively investigated in previous studies, the combination of experimental findings from different scales has received limited attention. In this study, we combine ex vivo mechanical responses of porcine brain tissue obtained at different time scales in a mechanical model. We investigated the mechanical behavior of three different brain regions in the quasi-static domain with multi-modal large strain rheometer measurements and at high frequencies with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). A comparative analysis of the mechanical parameters obtained from both experimental techniques demonstrated consistent regional variations in the viscoelastic behavior across the two domains. However, the mechanical behavior changes from a higher elasticity in the quasi-static and low frequency domain to a dominating viscosity at high frequencies. Based on the quasi-static and the high frequency behavior, we calibrated a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model and consequently unified the two responses in a single mechanical model to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior.</description>

      <title>Fast Eikonal Phase Retrieval for High-Throughput Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fast Eikonal Phase Retrieval (EPR) formulation that accelerates eikonal phase retrieval by more than two orders of magnitude while retaining controlled accuracy. The method is derived from a second-order asymptotic expansion in the propagation distance $L$ and complemented by the leading Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB)
  wave-optics correction, yielding an efficient iterative correction scheme preconditioned by FFT-diagonal, energy-dependent inverse operators (Paganin-type filters). To ensure robustness across practical experimental regimes, we combine two complementary solvers: (i) a local $O(L^2)$ closure that is accurate when eikonal shifts remain sub-pixel, and (ii) a non-local formulation for multi-pixel shifts, in which intensity is propagated through an explicit eikonal ray mapping using a mass-conserving bilinear redisribution on the detector grid, and detector residuals are transferred back to the object grid by the corresponding adjoint (transpose), implemented as bilinear interpolation, before applying an approximate FFT-diagonal preconditioner to accelerate convergence. The same framework supports polychromatic data through a compact spectral discretisation, allowing energy-dependent transport and inversion while keeping the iteration GPU/FFT efficient. Overall, this unified approach enables accurate and computationally efficient phase retrieval across propagation conditions relevant to high-throughput PPC-$\mu$CT experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards a better understanding of abdominal wall biomechanics: in vivo relationship between dynamic intra-abdominal pressure and magnetic resonance imaging measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background In vivo mechanical behaviour of the abdominal wall has been poorly characterised and important details are missing regarding the occurrence and post-operative recurrence rate of hernias which can be as high as 30 %. This study aimed to assess the correlation between abdominal wall displacement and intra-abdominal pressure, as well as abdominal compliance. Methods Eighteen healthy participants performed audio-guided passive (breathing) and active (coughing, Valsalva maneuver) exercises. Axial dynamic changes of abdominal muscles and visceral area were measured using MRI, and intra-abdominal pressure with ingested pressure sensor. Findings Correlations between abdominal wall displacement and intra-abdominal pressure were specific to participant, exercise, and varying between rectus abdominis and lateral muscles. Strong correlations were found between rectus abdominis displacement and intra-abdominal pressure during breathing (r = 0.92 $\pm$ 0.06), as well as lateral muscles displacement with intra-abdominal pressure during coughing and Valsalva maneuver (r = --0.98 $\pm$ 0.03 and -- 0.94 $\pm$ 0.05 respectively). The abdominal pseudo-compliance varied greatly among participants during muscular contraction, the coefficient of variation reaching up to 70 %. Interpretation The combination of intra-abdominal pressure and dynamic MRI measurements enables the identification of participant-specific behaviour pattern. Intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal wall dynamic undergo consistent and predictable interactions. However, this relationship is subject-specific and may not be extrapolated to other individuals. Therefore, both intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal wall motion must be measured in the same participant in order to accurately characterise the abdominal wall behaviour. These results are of great importance for mesh design, surgical decision-making, and personalised healthcare.</description>

      <title>Predictive Dosimetry in PSMA-Targeted Radiopharmaceutical Therapies: A PBPK Modeling and Machine Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive dosimetry is central to enabling personalized radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), particularly in prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted theranostics. In this work, we develop a three layer computational framework that integrates physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling with machine learning (ML) to predict both physical (AUC, absorbed dose) and biological (BED, EQD2) dosimetric endpoints in tumors and major organs. In the first layer, we generated 640 virtual patients using PBPK simulations of F-18, Ga-68, and Cu-64 labeled PSMA PET tracers paired with Lu-177 PSMA therapy, producing 15360 tumor and organ time activity curves (TACs) under realistic biological variability and PET-like noise. In the second layer, TACs were transformed into quantitative kinetic features and mapped to physical and biological dose metrics. In the third layer, ML models (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Ridge, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) were trained to predict RPT doses from PET derived features, with performance evaluated using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R2. Cu-64 PSMA-617 based PET yielded the most robust predictions, achieving tumor dose MAPE as low as 8 percent and 10 to 20 percent for normal organs, while F-18 DCFPyL showed volume dependent performance and Ga-68 PSMA-11 exhibited higher variability. SHAP analysis revealed that peak uptake, clearance, and early kinetic features dominated predictive performance across organs and endpoints. This PBPK ML framework enables scalable, physiology informed predictive dosimetry and provides a foundation for trial design and patient specific treatment planning in PSMA targeted RPT. These results demonstrate that pre therapy PET can serve as a reliable surrogate for post therapy dosimetry, enabling scalable personalization of PSMA targeted RPT.</description>
