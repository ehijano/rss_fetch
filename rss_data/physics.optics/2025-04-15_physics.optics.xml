      <title>An Inverse Method for the Design of Freeform Double-Reflector Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an inverse method to design two-dimensional freeform imaging systems. We present the mathematical model to design a parallel-to-point double-reflector imaging system using inverse methods from nonimaging optics. We impose an imaging condition on the energy distributions at the source and target of the optical system. Our freeform design is compared to the classical Schwarzschild telescope, which is well-known for minimizing third-order aberrations. A raytracer using quasi-interpolation is employed to test the performance of both designs by comparing the spot sizes corresponding to on-axis and off-axis light rays. We show that the inverse freeform design outperforms the classical design.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale second harmonic generation microscopy of ferroelectric domains in x-cut thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is a widely used platform for nonlinear frequency conversion, as its strong nonlinear susceptibility and enhanced modal confinement intensify nonlinear interactions. Frequency doubling from NIR to visible wavelengths necessitates fabrication of quasi-phase matching (QPM) gratings with minimal period variation (&lt;20nm) and control of ferroelectric domain inversion at the micron-scale along centimeter-long waveguides. Second harmonic generation microscopy (SHM) is a powerful tool for optimizing domain engineering (E-field poling), and it enabled the fabrication of near-ideal QPM gratings. Here, we show that increasing the SHM raster scan step size from 200nm to 400nm results in a 4x imaging speedup without sacrificing the accuracy of QPM grating characterization. To that end, Monte Carlo simulation of the coupled rate equations agreed with experimental measurements of second harmonic output power. We also employed a statistical subsampling scheme to characterize 5.6 mm-long waveguides (poling period = 3.240um) in approximately 5 minutes (30 seconds per field x 10 fields per waveguide). Each field is 100 microns in length, so our results indicate that sampling only ~300 periods of a QPM grating is sufficient to accurately predict its second harmonic output. For the device characterized, this corresponds to ~20% of the total grating length. Together, discretization and device-length subsampling speed up SHM imaging by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Strongly confined Mid-infrared to Terahertz Phonon Polaritons in Ultra-thin SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising platform for subwavelength optical manipulation, offering distinct advantages for applications in infrared sensing, imaging, and optoelectronic devices. However, the narrow Reststrahlen bands of conventional polar materials impose significant limitations on their applications across the mid-infrared (MIR) to terahertz (THz) range. Addressing this challenge requires the development of materials capable of supporting SPhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high quality factor. Here, using monochromatic electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultra-thin SrTiO3 membranes encompass the exceptional properties mentioned above that have long been sought after. Systematic measurements across varying membrane thicknesses reveal two distinct SPhP branches characterized by wide spectral dispersion, high field confinement, and anomalously slow group velocities spanning from the MIR (68 ~ 99 meV) to THz (12 ~ 59 meV) range. Notably, in membranes approaching ~ 3 nm thickness (~ 8 unit cells), these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~ 7 * 10-5 c, rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO3 as a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the degenerate optical parametric oscillations threshold in bichromatically pumped microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated microring resonators have a broad range of applications in diverse fields with the potential to design compact, robust, energy efficient devices crucial for quantum applications. Degenerate optical parametric oscillations (DOPOs) realized in dual-pumped microring resonator (MRRs) with third-order optical nonlinearity are of special interest. They demonstrate both bistability of the phase of the excited signal mode and generation of non-classical light, that can be used for coherent photonic computing. Using coupled-mode equations we perform a comprehensive numerical analysis of DOPO conditions at normal group velocity dispersion (GVD) and bichromatic pump. Through both analytical and numerical approaches, we identify optimal setup parameters that minimize threshold power, highlighting the importance of considering the full spectrum of mode interactions. Additionally, we show that dispersion engineering, achievable in photonic molecules or photonic crystal microresonators, may provide a targeted frequency shift of specific microresonator modes resulting in pump power threshold reduction.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spatial light modulation in the ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial light modulators enable arbitrary control of the intensity of optical light fields and facilitate a variety of applications in biology, astronomy and atomic, molecular and optical physics. For coherent light fields, holography, implemented through arbitrary phase modulation, represents a highly power-efficient technique to shape the intensity of light patterns. Here, we introduce and benchmark a novel spatial light modulator based on a piston micro-mirror array. In particular, we utilize the reflection-based device to demonstrate arbitrary beam shaping in the ultraviolet regime at a wavelength of 322 nm. We correct aberrations of the reflected wavefront and show that the modulator does not add detectable excess phase noise to the reflected light field. We utilize the intrinsically low latency of the architecture to demonstrate fast switching of arbitrary light patterns synchronized with short laser pulses at an update rate of 1 kHz. Finally, we outline how the modulator can act as an important component of a zone-based architecture for a neutral-atom quantum computer or simulator, including ultraviolet wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Electro-optically tunable second-harmonic generation in lithium niobate metasurfaces boosted by Brillouin zone folding induced bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) metasurfaces exhibit remarkable Pockels effect-driven electro-optic tunability, enabling dynamic control of optical responses through external electric fields. When combined with their high second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{2}$), this tunability is projected into the nonlinear landscape, realizing second-harmonic generation (SHG)-dominated functionalities in integrated photonics. However, achieving deep SHG modulation in LN metasurfaces remains challenging due to LN's limited refractive index tunability under practical driving voltage. To address this, we design an air-hole-structured LN metasurface by strategically adjusting air hole positions to induce Brillouin zone folding-enabled bound states in the continuum with ultrahigh quality factors ($Q&gt;10^{4}$). Numerical simulations demonstrate a $3\%$ SHG conversion efficiency at 2 MW/cm$^{2}$ excitation and a modulation depth exceeding 0.99 under 12 V peak-to-peak voltage ($\Delta V_{\text{pp}}$). This work establishes a compact framework for electrically tunable nonlinear optics, advancing applications in integrated quantum light sources and programmable photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Dressed bound states and non-Markovian dynamics with a whispering-gallery-mode microcavity coupled to a two-level atom and a semi-infinite photonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dressed bound states (DBS) in an open cavity with a whispering-gallery-mode microring coupled to a two-level atom and a waveguide with a mirror at the right end. We demonstrate that the non-Hermiticity of an open cavity facilitates the formation of the DBS, which consists of the vacancy-like DBS and Friedrich-Wintgen DBS. By deriving analytical conditions for these DBS, we show that when a two-level atom couples to the standing-wave mode that corresponds to a node of the photonic wave function the vacancy-like DBS occur, which are characterized by null spectral density at cavity resonance. Conversely, Friedrich-Wintgen DBS can be realized by continuously adjusting system parameters and indicated by the disappearance of the Rabi peak in the emission spectrum, which is a distinctive feature in the strong-coupling regime. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the non-Markovian regime and find that our results are consistent with those obtained under the Markovian approximation in the wideband limit. In the non-Markovian regime, we analyze DBS for both zero and non-zero accumulated phase factors. For zero accumulated phase factors, the non-Markovian regime exhibits higher peak values and longer relaxation times for vacancy-like DBS compared to the Markovian regime, where the Friedrich-Wintgen DBS are absent in the non-Markovian case. Finally, we establish the correspondence between the energy spectrum and bound state conditions for non-zero accumulated phase factors and analyze the influence of various parameters on non-Markovian bound states. Our work exhibits bound state manipulations through non-Markovian open quantum system, which holds great potential for building high-performance quantum devices for applications such as sensing, photon storage, and nonclassical light generation.</description>

      <title>Advances in dual-chirped optical parametric amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy infrared lasers have enabled the generation of strong field phenomena, and among such phenomena, high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from gases has enabled attosecond-scale observations in atoms or molecules. Lasers with longer wavelengths and shorter pulse widths are advantageous for generating higher photon energy and shorter attosecond pulses via HHG. Thus, the development of ultrashort mid-infrared (MIR) lasers has progressed. This paper reviews research on developing high-energy MIR lasers using the dual-chirped optical parametric amplification (DC-OPA) method. We developed TW-class multi-cycle lasers in the MIR region, which was previously difficult. The advanced DC-OPA method, an extension of the conventional DC-OPA method, enables one-octave amplification of the wavelength, and a TW-class single-cycle laser was developed. These lasers were utilized for HHG, enabling single-shot absorption spectroscopy, and one-octave supercontinuum soft X-ray generation for single-cycle isolated attosecond pulse. We also show the development of multi-TW sub-cycle DC-OPA pumped by Ti:sapphire laser and high average power MIR single-cycle DC-OPA using thin-disk laser technology.</description>

      <title>Broadband source-surrounded cloak for on-chip antenna radiation pattern protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the frequency range of electromagnetic wave communication continues to expand and the integration of integrated circuits increases, electromagnetic waves emitted by on-chip antennas are prone to scattering from electronic components, which limits further improvements in integration and the protection of radiation patterns. Cloaks can be used to reduce electromagnetic scattering; however, they cannot achieve both broadband and omnidirectional effectiveness simultaneously. Moreover, their operating modes are typically designed for scenarios where the source is located outside the cloak, making it difficult to address this problem. In this work, we propose a dispersionless air-impedance-matched metamaterial over the 2-8 GHz bandwidth that achieves an adjustable effective refractive index ranging from 1.1 to 1.5, with transmittance maintained above 93%. Based on this metamaterial, we introduce a broadband source-surrounded cloak that can guide electromagnetic waves from a broadband source surrounded by the cloak in any propagation direction to bypass obstacles and reproduce the original wavefronts outside the cloak. Thereby protecting the radiation pattern from distortion due to scattering caused by obstacles. Our work demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the integration density of integrated circuits and improving the operational stability of communication systems.</description>

      <title>Topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonic waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic driving is a powerful tool to generate exotic topological phases without static counterparts, such as the anomalous chiral edge modes from bulk bands with zero Chern number and topological $\pi$ modes exhibiting period-doubled dynamics. Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode, namely the $\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has potential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a square-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the co-existence of conventional zero, $\pi$ modes, and the new $\pi/2$ modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the $\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Application of nanodiamond-polymer composite holographic gratings in a very cold neutron interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, photosensitive materials have been used for the development of optical devices not only for light, but also for cold and very cold neutrons. We show that holographically recorded gratings in nanodiamond-polymer composites (nDPC) form ideal diffraction elements for very cold neutrons. Their advantage of high diffraction efficiency, combined with low angular selectivity as a two-port beam splitter, meets the necessary conditions for application in a very cold neutron interferometer. We provide an overview of the latest achievements in the construction of such a triple Laue interferometer. A first operational test of the interferometer is planned immediately after this conference in May 2025.</description>

      <title>SEMPO - Retrieving poles, residues and zeros in the complex frequency plane from an arbitrary spectral response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Singularity Expansion Method Parameter Optimizer - SEMPO - is a toolbox to extract the complex poles, zeros and residues of an arbitrary response function acquired along the real frequency axis. SEMPO allows to determine this full set of complex parameters of linear physical systems from their spectral responses only, without prior information about the system. The method leverages on the Singularity Expansion Method of the physical signal. This analytical expansion of the meromorphic function in the complex frequency plane motivates the use of the Cauchy method and auto-differentiation-based optimization approach to retrieve the complex poles, zeros and residues from the knowledge of the spectrum over a finite and real spectral range. Both approaches can be sequentially associated to provide highly accurate reconstructions of physical signals in large spectral windows. The performances of SEMPO are assessed and analysed in several configurations that include the dielectric permittivity of materials and the optical response spectra of various optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Widely FSR tunable high Q-factor microresonators formed at the intersection of straight optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new class of high-Q tunable microresonators formed at the intersection of two straight silica optical fibers, whose free spectral range (FSR) can be widely tuned by fiber rotation. The proposed configuration avoids the limitations of traditional monolithic microresonators that lack FSR tunability required for a wide range of photonic applications. Using small rotation angles (1-15 mrad), we demonstrate a tunability of the FSR from 2 pm to 10 pm, enabled by microscale fiber displacements that reshape the resonator profile over millimeter scales. The proposed approach minimizes mechanical stress, supports miniaturization, and is suitable for integration with MEMS. It paves the way for the fabrication of tunable delay lines, ultralow repetition rate broadband frequency comb generators, and nonlocal optofluidic sensors on a chip.</description>

      <title>Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</description>

      <title>Spectral Mode Enhancement in Coherent-harmonic Dual-comb Spectroscopy Enables Exceeding 300-fold Averaging Time Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) is a novel Fourier-transform spectroscopy not relying on mechanical scanning and capable of simultaneously achieving high-speed, high spectral resolution, and broad optical bandwidth. Despite this, conventional DCS suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single acquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by the high peak power of mode-locked pulses, necessitating coherent averaging. Consequently, averaging numerous interferograms compromises both the exceptional time resolution and places greater demands on long-term mutual coherence and stability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to enhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in coherent-harmonic pulses. As a proof-of-concept, we employ two frequency combs with mode spacing of $\sim$12.5 MHz, operating at a 20th harmonic repetition rate of $\sim$250 MHz. The result demonstrates a $&gt;$300-fold reduction in averaging time while achieving comparable SNR in conventional DCS. This reduction is expected to be further enhancement through integration with ultra-high repetition rate combs, such as microresonator combs. This approach promises both a recovery of the inherent high-speed capability and a mitigation of the coherence-time requirements, thereby making it possible to significantly facilitate subsequent DCS investigations, as well as field-deployed implementations.</description>

      <title>Bounds as blueprints: towards optimal and accelerated photonic inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our ability to structure materials at the nanoscale has, and continues to, enable key advances in optical control. In pursuit of optimal photonic designs, substantial progress has been made on two complementary fronts: bottom-up structural optimizations (inverse design) discover complex high-performing structures but offer no guarantees of optimality; top-down field optimizations (convex relaxations) reveal fundamental performance limits but offer no guarantees that structures meeting the limits exist. We bridge the gap between these two parallel paradigms by introducing a ``verlan'' initialization method that exploits the encoded local and global wave information in duality-based convex relaxations to guide inverse design towards better-performing structures. We illustrate this technique via the challenging problem of Purcell enhancement, maximizing the power extracted from a small emitter in the vicinity of a photonic structure, where ill-conditioning and the presence of competing local maxima lead to sub-optimal designs for adjoint optimization. Structures discovered by our verlan method outperform standard (random) initializations by close to an order of magnitude and approach fundamental performance limits within a factor of two, highlighting the possibility of accessing significant untapped performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced spectral diffusion of T centers in silicon nanophotonic devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.</description>

      <title>Practical Advantage of Classical Communication in Entanglement Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is the cornerstone of quantum communication, yet conventional detection relies solely on local measurements. In this work, we present a unified theoretical and experimental framework demonstrating that one-way local operations and classical communication (1-LOCC) can significantly outperform purely local measurements in detecting high-dimensional quantum entanglement. By casting the entanglement detection problem as a semidefinite program (SDP), we derive protocols that minimize false negatives at fixed false-positive rates. A variational generative machine-learning algorithm efficiently searches over high-dimensional parameter spaces, identifying states and measurement strategies that exhibit a clear 1-LOCC advantage. Experimentally, we realize a genuine event-ready protocol on a three-dimensional photonic entanglement source, employing fiber delays as short-lived quantum memories. We implement rapid, FPGA-based sampling of the optimized probabilistic instructions, allowing Bob's measurement settings to adapt to Alice's outcomes in real time. Our results validate the predicted 1-LOCC advantage in a realistic noisy setting and reduce the experimental trials needed to certify entanglement. These findings mark a step toward scalable, adaptive entanglement detection methods crucial for quantum networks and computing, paving the way for more efficient generation and verification of high-dimensional entangled states.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Rare-Earth Ion-Photon Interaction and Strong Coupling in Optical Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between an emitter and a cavity is significant for advancing quantum networks. Due to their long optical and spin coherence times, rare-earth ions (REIs) represent a compelling platform for quantum networks. However, their inherently weak intra-4f optical transitions typically result in low coupling strength, thus restricting most current achievements to the weak coupling regime. This work proposes a scheme to realize an on-chip quantum network by coupling REIs to high-quality whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavities. Additionally, we provide numerical validation for a parametric amplification technique to enhance the emitter-cavity coupling strength. As an extension of this approach, the coupled system efficiently achieves the quantum entanglement of local and flying qubits. This study deepens the understanding of emitter-cavity interactions and contributes to realizing REIs-based photonic platforms, which are crucial to distributed quantum computing and developing robust quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a photothermal infrared (IR) spectroscopy technique based on a nanoelectromechanical system, which is coupled to a commercial Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (NEMS--FTIR) as a promising solution for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. Polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoparticles with nominal diameters of 100, 54, and 262~nm, respectively, were analyzed by NEMS--FTIR with limits of detection (LoD) of 353~pg for PS, 102~pg for PP, and 355~pg for PVC. The PS mass deposited on the NEMS chips was estimated from the measured absorptance values and the attenuation coefficient of PS. The wide spectral range of the FTIR allowed the identification of individual polymer nanoparticles from a mixture. The potential of NEMS--FTIR for the analysis of real--world samples was evaluated by confirming the presence of polyamide (PA) particles released from commercial tea bags during brewing. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed continuous release of PA particles over time.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of multiresonance filters via quasi-normal mode theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical methodology for inverse design of compact high-order/multiresonance filters in linear passive 2-port wave-scattering systems, targeting any desired transmission spectrum (such as standard pass/stop-band filters). Our formulation allows for both large-scale topology optimization and few-variable parametrized-geometry optimization. It is an extension of a quasi-normal mode theory and analytical filter-design criteria (on the system resonances and background response) derived in our previous work. Our new optimization-oriented formulation relies solely on a scattering solver and imposes these design criteria as equality constraints with easily calculated (via the adjoint method) derivatives, so that our algorithm is numerically tractable, robust, and well-suited for large-scale inverse design. We demonstrate its effectiveness by designing 3rd- and 4th-order elliptic and Chebyshev filters for photonic metasurfaces, multilayer films, and electrical LC-ladder circuits.</description>

Abstract: Spectroscopic polarimetry (SP) is a powerful tool for evaluation of thin film, optical materials, and biological samples because it can provide both polarimetric and spectroscopic characteristics of objects. However, its performance is often hampered by the mechanical instability and the limited data acquisition speed arising from the mechanical polarization modulation. Dual-comb spectroscopic polarimetry (DCSP) based on a combination of SP with dual-comb spectroscopy can acquire optical spectra of amplitude ratio and phase difference in p- and s-polarization components of the output light from simultaneous measurement of optical spectra of optical amplitude and phase in p- and s-polarization components without the need for mechanical polarization modulation. In this article, we combine the DCSP with polarization control pulse sequences (PCPS) with different polarizations and time delays for a more detailed analysis of the sample's polarization response based on Jones matrix. We obtain Jones matrix of a sample as a function of wavelength by measuring those optical spectra while multiplexing the incident light into multiple polarizations instead of a single polarization. Such Jones matrix DCSP (JM-DCSP) is applied for analysis of optical elements with known polarization property and its experimental result is in good agreement with theoretical values, indicating the validity of the proposed method. JM-DCSP will further expand the application scope of SP.</description>

Abstract: Phonon-polaritons (PhPs) in low-symmetry van der Waals materials confine mid-infrared electromagnetic radiation well below the diffraction limit for nanoscale optics, sensing, and energy control. However, controlling the PhP dispersion at the nanoscale through intrinsic material properties$-$without external fields, lithography, or intercalants$-$remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate vacancy-engineered tuning of PhPs in $\alpha$-phase molybdenum trioxide ($\alpha$-MoO$_3$) via oxygen vacancy formation and lattice strain. Near-field nanoimaging of PhPs in processed $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ reveals an average polariton wavevector modulation of $\Delta k/k \approx 0.13 $ within the lower Restrahlen band. Stoichiometric analysis, density functional theory, and finite-difference time-domain simulations show agreement with the experimental results and suggest an induced vacancy concentration of $1\% - 2\%$ along with $(1.2\pm 0.2)\%$ compressive strain, resulting in a non-volatile dielectric permittivity modulation of up to $\Delta \varepsilon / \varepsilon \approx 0.15$. Despite these lattice modifications, the lifetimes of thermomechanically tuned PhPs remain high at $1.2 \pm 0.31$ ps. These results establish thermomechanical vacancy engineering as a general strategy to reprogram polaritonic response in vdW crystals, offering a new degree of freedom for embedded, non-volatile nanophotonics.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of full-wave numerical simulations of light transmission through layers of irregular dielectric particles, demonstrating three-dimensional Anderson localization of light in disordered, uncorrelated discrete media. Our simulations show that a high degree of disorder in a dense layer suppresses the transverse spreading of a propagating beam. A transition from the purely diffusive regime to a non-exponential temporal dependence is observed in short-pulse time-resolved transmission measurements as the system approaches the Ioffe-Regel condition. Along with this, the transmission spectrum becomes consistent with the Thouless criterion. The effect depends on the turbidity of the layer: increasing the volume fraction of scatterers and the refractive index contrast enhances the non-exponential behavior induced by disorder, which is a clear signature of Anderson localization.</description>

Abstract: As photonic technologies continue to grow in multidimensional aspects, integrated photonics holds a unique position and continuously presents enormous possibilities to research communities. Applications span across data centers, environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and highly compact communication components, with further possibilities growing endlessly. Here, we provide a review of state of the art integrated photonic sensors operating in near and mid infrared wavelength regions on various material platforms. Among different materials, architectures, and technologies leading the way for on chip sensors, we discuss optical sensing principles commonly applied to biochemical and gas sensing. Our focus is particularly on passive and active optical waveguides, including dispersion engineered metamaterial based structures an essential approach for enhancing the interaction between light and analytes in chip scale sensors. We harness a diverse array of cutting edge sensing technologies, heralding a revolutionary on chip sensing paradigm. Our arsenal includes refractive index based sensing, plasmonic, and spectroscopy, forging an unparalleled foundation for innovation and precision. Furthermore, we include a brief discussion of recent trends and computational concepts incorporating Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning (AI/ML) and deep learning approaches over the past few years to improve the qualitative and quantitative analysis of sensor measurements.</description>

      <title>Double helical plasmonic antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic double helical antennas are a means to funnel circularly polarized light down to the nanoscale. Here, an existing design tool for single helices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas that combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional light emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides additional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The helical antennas are fabricated by direct writing with a focused electron beam, a technique that is unrivaled in terms of spatial resolution and 3D shape fidelity. After the printing process, the structures are purified using ozone plasma at room temperature, resulting in the smallest continuous double helix antennas ever realized in gold. Fabricated antennas are studied regarding their polarization-dependent transmission behavior, which shows a large and broadband dissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an important tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum photonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future nanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model describing long-range atom-atom interactions in a two-dimensional periodic or a-periodic lattice of optical centers considering spectral and spatial broadening effects. Using both analytical and numerical Green's function techniques, we develop a mathematical framework to describe effective atom-atom interactions and collective behaviors in the presence of disorder. This framework is applicable to a broad range of quantum systems with arbitrary lattice geometries, including cold atoms, solid-state photonics, and superconducting platforms. The model can be used, for example, to scalably design quantum optical elements, e.g. a quantum lens, harnessing atomistic engineering (e.g. via ion implantation) of collective interactions in materials to enhance quantum properties at scale.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 {\deg}C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

Abstract: Laser intensity noise is a main limitation of measurement and sensing mission represented by gravitational wave detection. We develop a noise decomposition model and design the core elements of the feedback loop independently based on the analysis results.

      <title>Programmable photonic waveguide arrays: opportunities and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of programmable photonics has advanced significantly in recent decades, driven by the rising demand for complex applications, such as optical quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, as the complexity of these applications increases, there is an increasing need for novel designs that enhance circuit transmission and enable further miniaturization. Photonic waveguide arrays (WAs) hold a unique position in integrated photonics, as they implement ``always-on'' Hamiltonians and have no direct analogs in free-space optics. They find applications in various fields, including light propagation studies, quantum walks, and topological photonics. Despite their versatility, the lack of reconfigurability has limited their utility and hindered further advancements for a long time. Recently, programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs) have emerged as a promising solution for overcoming the limitations of static WAs and PWA-based architectures have been proven to be universal. This perspective proposes a vision for photonic circuits based on PWAs as a new, interdisciplinary field. We review the history of the development of PWAs and outline their potential in areas such as simulation, communication, sensing, and classical and quantum information processing. This technology is expected to become increasingly feasible with advancements in programmable photonics, nanofabrication, and quantum control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables the use of physics-informed device topologies in inverse design and maintains compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a finite-difference-based numerical solver designed for the electric field formulation of vector wave equations in optically linear, non-magnetic, dielectric waveguides. We construct a generalized eigenvalue problem by incorporating all three components of the electric field into a self-consistent formulation. This ensures accurate enforcement of boundary conditions and reduces numerical artifacts, particularly at permittivity discontinuities. We validate the solver's performance through two representative waveguide structures, demonstrating its accuracy in computing both propagation constants and mode profiles.</description>

      <title>Analytical Framework of Orbital Angular Momentum Beam under Misaligned Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an analytical framework for modeling a detected orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectrum of an optical beam subject to tilt and lateral displacement. Firstly, we demonstrate that both types of misalignment generate OAM sidebands governed by the same functional form, each characterized by a distinct dimensionless parameter that depends on the beam's size and wavelength. Secondly, our analysis reveals that increasing the beam's topological charge broadens the detected OAM spectrum. Lastly, we show that when both tilt and lateral displacement are present, the contribution of the original OAM mode can be tuned: specifically, by orienting the tilt and displacement in perpendicular directions, the resulting misalignment effects interfere destructively, thereby reducing crosstalk.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Coherent Diffractive Imaging via Titled-Incidence Multi-Rotation-Angle Fusion Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) enables lensless imaging with experimental simplicity and a flexible field of view, yet its resolution is fundamentally constrained by the Abbe diffraction limit. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Tilted-Incidence Multi-Rotation-Angle Fusion Ptychography technique. This approach leverages a tilted-incidence geometry to extend the collection angle beyond the Abbe limit, achieving up to a -fold resolution enhancement. By acquiring diffraction patterns at multiple sample rotation angles, we capture complementary spatial frequency information. A tilted-incidence multi-rotation-angle fusion ptychographic iterative engine (tmf-PIE) algorithm is then employed to integrate these datasets, enabling super-resolution image reconstruction. Additionally, this method mitigates the anisotropic resolution artifacts inherent to tilted CDI geometries. Our technique represents a novel advancement in super-resolution imaging, providing a novel alternative alongside established methods such as STED, SIM, and SMLM.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson Phase Transitions in Y-shaped Plasmonic Valley Metal-slabs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Throughout history, all developmental trajectories of civilization - encompassing progress, creation, and innovation - have fundamentally pursued the paradigm shift 'from disorder to order'. In photonics, investigations into disordered systems have primarily focused on foundational principles governing signal diffusion and localization. This paper addresses terahertz device development by examining the dual role of disorder in photonic systems: while potentially compromising optical transmission stability, it simultaneously inspires innovative topological protection mechanisms. Building upon the symmetry-breaking induced valley-Hall topological Anderson phase transition in Y-shaped metallic structures, we achieve valley Chern number modulation through random rotation of constituent units, demonstrating progressive emergence of in-gap topological states with increasing disorder parameters and observing topological negative refraction phenomena. Furthermore, an effective Dirac two-band model is established to quantitatively characterize the evolution of bulk transport states under disorder variation. By strategically regulating disordered configurations to induce valley-Hall topological Anderson phase transitions, this research provides new pathways for overcoming critical technical challenges in terahertz devices, particularly transmission loss limitations.</description>

      <title>Efficient High-Dimensional Entangled State Analyzer with Linear Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of higher-dimensional photonic encodings (qudits) instead of two-dimensional encodings (qubits) can improve the loss tolerance and reduce the computational resources of photonic-based quantum information processing. To harness this potential, efficient schemes for entangling operations such as the high-dimensional generalization of a linear optics Bell measurement will be required. We show how an efficient high-dimensional entangled state analyzer can be implemented with a linear optics interferometer and auxiliary photonic states. The degree of entanglement of the auxiliary state is much less than in previous protocols as quantified by an exponentially smaller Schmidt rank. In addition, the auxiliary state only occupies a single spatial mode, allowing it to be generated deterministically from a single quantum emitter coupled to a small qubit register. The reduced complexity of the auxiliary states results in a high robustness to imperfections and we show that auxiliary states with fidelities above 0.9 for qudit dimensions 4 can be generated in the presence of qubit error rates on the order of 10%. This paves the way for experimental demonstrations with current hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification is a central task in deep learning algorithms. Usually, images are first captured and then processed by a sequence of operations, of which the artificial neuron represents one of the fundamental units. This paradigm requires significant resources that scale (at least) linearly in the image resolution, both in terms of photons and computational operations. Here, we present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. It classifies objects without reconstructing their images, using the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical artificial neuron.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Approach for Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectra of Driven Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers significant advantages in terms of high temporal and frequency resolutions and signal-to-noise ratio. Until now, the response-function (RF) formalism has been the prevalent theoretical description. In this study, we compare the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) method with the RF formalism in a three-level system with a constant control field. We obtain the signals from both approaches and compare their population dynamics and 2DCS. We propose the quasi-Green functions for the NHH method, which allows all dominant Liouville paths to be inferred. We further simulate the 2DCS of Rh(CO)$_2$C$_5$H$_7$O$_2$ (RDC) dissolved in hexane with the NHH method, which is in good agreement with the previous experiments. Although the NHH method overestimates relaxations, it provides all important paths by analytical solutions, which are different from the four paths used in the RF formalism. Our results demonstrate that the NHH method is more suitable than the RF formalism for investigating the systems including relaxation and control fields via the 2DCS.</description>

      <title>EgoEvGesture: Gesture Recognition Based on Egocentric Event Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Egocentric gesture recognition is a pivotal technology for enhancing natural human-computer interaction, yet traditional RGB-based solutions suffer from motion blur and illumination variations in dynamic scenarios. While event cameras show distinct advantages in handling high dynamic range with ultra-low power consumption, existing RGB-based architectures face inherent limitations in processing asynchronous event streams due to their synchronous frame-based nature. Moreover, from an egocentric perspective, event cameras record data that includes events generated by both head movements and hand gestures, thereby increasing the complexity of gesture recognition. To address this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for event data processing, incorporating (1) a lightweight CNN with asymmetric depthwise convolutions to reduce parameters while preserving spatiotemporal features, (2) a plug-and-play state-space model as context block that decouples head movement noise from gesture dynamics, and (3) a parameter-free Bins-Temporal Shift Module (BSTM) that shifts features along bins and temporal dimensions to fuse sparse events efficiently. We further establish the EgoEvGesture dataset, the first large-scale dataset for egocentric gesture recognition using event cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 62.7% accuracy tested on unseen subjects with only 7M parameters, 3.1% higher than state-of-the-art approaches. Notable misclassifications in freestyle motions stem from high inter-personal variability and unseen test patterns differing from training data. Moreover, our approach achieved a remarkable accuracy of 97.0% on the DVS128 Gesture, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method on public datasets. The dataset and models are made available at https://github.com/3190105222/EgoEv_Gesture.</description>

Abstract: Controlling the spatial arrangement of optically active elements is crucial for the advancement of engineered photonic systems. Color centers in nanodiamond offer unique advantages for quantum sensing and information processing; however, their integration into complex optical architectures is limited by challenges in precise and reproducible positioning, as well as efficient coupling. DNA origami provides an elegant solution, as demonstrated by recent studies showcasing nanoscale positioning of fluorescent nanodiamonds and plasmonic gold nanoparticles. Here, we present a scalable and robust method for covalently functionalizing nanodiamonds with DNA, enabling high-yield, spatially controlled assembly of diamond and gold nanoparticles onto DNA origami. By precisely controlling the interparticle spacing, we reveal distance-dependent modulation of NV center photoluminescence with a 10-fold increase in the fastest decay pathway at short interparticle distances. Our findings indicate selective plasmon-driven effects and interplay between radiative and non-radiative processes. This work overcomes key limitations in current nanodiamond assembly strategies and provides insights into engineering NV photoluminescence by plasmonic coupling that advance toward quantum photonic and sensing applications.</description>

Abstract: Practical distributed quantum computing and error correction require high-qubit-rate, high-fidelity, and low-reconfiguration-latency quantum networks between heterogeneous quantum information processors. Unfortunately, in a quantum network with homogeneous quantum processors, the theoretical entanglement distribution rate for a single channel is limited to the 100-kHz level with a millisecond-level reconfiguration latency, which is not sufficient for error-corrected distributed quantum computing. Here, we propose a quantum network architecture by introducing the concept of a reconfigurable quantum interface. In our protocol, through tuning the frequency and temporal mode of the photonic qubits to dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) channels, a 4.5 MHz Bell pair distribution rate, with a potential of more than 40 MHz Bell pair rate, is achieved. Through the use of reconfigurable quantum interfaces and wavelength-selective switches, a nanosecond network reconfiguration latency can be demonstrated with low-loss, low-infidelity and high-dimensional switches. To the best of our knowledge, our architecture is the first practical solution that can accommodate the entanglement distribution between heterogeneous quantum nodes with a rate and latency that satisfy most distributed quantum circuits and error correction requirements. The proposed architecture is compatible with the industry-standard DWDM infrastructure, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for distributed quantum computing.</description>
