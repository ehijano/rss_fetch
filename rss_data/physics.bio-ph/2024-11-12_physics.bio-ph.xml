      <title>Cell bulging and extrusion in a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model for curved epithelial sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell extrusion is an essential mechanism for controlling cell density in epithelial tissues. Another essential element of epithelia is curvature, which is required to achieve complex shapes, like in the lung or intestine. Here we introduce a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model to study the interplay between extrusion and curvature. We find a generic cellular bulging instability at topological defects which is much stronger than for standard vertex models. To clarify the underlying mechanism, we analytically calculate the energy landscape for a single bulging cell in a mean field tissue. We find that extrusion is energetically preferred at topological defects due to a redistribution of Gaussian curvature into the defect. We show that it can be driven both by a decrease in apico-basal tension or by contractile line tensions. We also show that extrusion can be suppressed by luminal pressure and interfacial bending rigidity, allowing for additional control of this important process. Our theory suggests that epithelial curvature naturally leads to cell bulging and extrusion because the interfacial curvature of individual cells at the defects strongly amplifies buckling effected by tissue-scale topological defects in elastic sheets.</description>

      <title>cgNA+min: computation of sequence-dependent dsDNA energy-minimising minicircle configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA minicircles are closed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments that have been demonstrated to be an important experimental tool to understand supercoiled, or stressed, DNA mechanics, such as nucleosome positioning and DNA-protein interactions. Specific minicircles can be simulated using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. However, the enormous sequence space makes it unfeasible to exhaustively explore the sequence-dependent mechanics of DNA minicircles using either experiment or MD. For linear fragments, the cgNA+ model, a computationally efficient sequence-dependent coarse-grained model using enhanced Curves+ internal coordinates (rigid base plus rigid phosphate) of double-stranded nucleic acids (dsNAs), predicts highly accurate nonlocal sequence-dependent equilibrium distributions for an arbitrary sequence when compared with MD simulations. This article addresses the problem of modeling sequence-dependent topologically closed and, therefore, stressed fragments of dsDNA. We introduce cgNA+min, a computational approach within the cgNA+ framework, which extends the cgNA+ model applicability to compute the sequence-dependent energy minimising configurations of covalently closed dsDNA minicircles of various lengths and linking numbers (Lk). The main idea is to derive the appropriate chain rule to express the cgNA+ energy in absolute coordinates involving quaternions where the closure condition is simple to handle. We also present a semi-analytic method for efficiently computing sequence-dependent initial minicircles having arbitrary Lk and length. For different classes and lengths of sequences, we demonstrate that the dsDNA minicircle energies computed using cgNA+min agree well with the energies approximated from experimentally measured J-factor values. Finally, we present the minicircle shape, energy, and multiplicity of Lk for more than 120K random DNA sequences of different lengths.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive representation of selection at loci with multiple alleles that allows complex forms of genotypic fitness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic diversity is central to the process of evolution. Both natural selection and random genetic drift are influenced by the level of genetic diversity of a population; selection acts on diversity while drift samples from it. At a given locus in a diploid population, each individual carries only two alleles, but the population as a whole can possess a much larger number of alleles, with the upper limit constrained by twice the population size. This allows for many possible types of homozygotes and heterozygotes. Moreover, there are biologically important loci, for example those related to the MHC complex, the ABO blood types, and cystic fibrosis, that exhibit a large number of alleles. Despite this, much of population genetic theory, and data analysis, are limited to considering biallelic loci. However, to the present, what is lacking is a flexible expression for the force of selection that allows an arbitrary number of alleles (and hence an arbitrary number of heterozygotes), along with a variety of forms of fitness. In this work, we remedy this absence by giving an analytical representation of the force of selection that emphasises the very different roles played by the diversity of the population, and the fitnesses of different genotypes. The result presented facilitates our understanding and applies in a variety of different situations involving multiple alleles. This includes situations where fitnesses are: additive, multiplicative, randomly fluctuating, frequency-dependent, and it allows fitnesses which involve explicit gene interactions, such as heterozygote advantage.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of neuromorphic dynamics from a single scalar time series using variational autoencoder and neural network map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the reconstruction of a family of dynamical systems with neuromorphic behavior using a single scalar time series. A model of a physiological neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is considered. Single time series of one of its variables is shown to be enough to train a neural network that can operate as a discrete time dynamical system with one control parameter. The neural network system is created in two steps. First, the delay-coordinate embedding vectors are constructed form the original time series and their dimension is reduced with by means of a variational autoencoder to obtain the recovered state-space vectors. It is shown that an appropriate reduced dimension can be determined by analyzing the autoencoder training process. Second, pairs of the recovered state-space vectors at consecutive time steps supplied with a constant value playing the role of a control parameter are used to train another neural network to make it operate as a recurrent map. The regimes of thus created neural network system observed when its control parameter is varied are in very good accordance with those of the original system, though they were not explicitly presented during training.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical genotype networks and incipient ecological speciation in Q$\beta$ phage quasispecies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how viral mutant spectra organize and explore genotype space is essential for unraveling the mechanisms driving evolution at the finest scale. Here we use deep-sequencing data of an amplicon in the A2 protein of the RNA bacteriophage Q$\beta$ to reconstruct genotype networks with tens of thousands of different haplotypes. The study of populations evolved under different temperature regimes uncovers generic topological features conditioned by fundamental structural motifs of genotype networks -- tetrahedrons, triangles, and squares -- that govern their local architecture. Mutant swarms display a hierarchical structure where sequences cluster around a highly connected and abundant sequence core that sustains population diversity. The immediate neighborhood of this core is comprehensively sampled, with no signs of selection, while a few mutations away sampling becomes dynamical and sparse, showing signs of purifying selection. By aggregating genotype networks from populations adapted to different temperatures, we capture the early stages of evolutionary divergence, with overlapping populations that remain connected through short mutational paths. Even at the time scale of these experiments, evolutionary pathways might be multiple, preventing the backward reconstruction of unique trajectories once mutations have been fixed. This analysis provides a detailed view of the local, fine-scale processes shaping viral quasispecies evolution and underscores the usefulness of genotype networks as an enlightening visualization of the organization of mutant swarms.</description>

      <title>Biohybrid Microrobots Based on Jellyfish Stinging Capsules and Janus Particles for In Vitro Deep-Tissue Drug Penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microrobots engineered from self-propelling active particles, extend the reach of robotic operations to submillimeter dimensions and are becoming increasingly relevant for various tasks, such as manipulation of micro/nanoscale cargo, particularly targeted drug delivery. However, achieving deep-tissue penetration and drug delivery remain a challenge. This work developed a novel biohybrid microrobot consisting of jellyfish stinging capsules, which act as natural nanoinjectors for efficient penetration and delivery, assembled onto an active Janus particle (JP). While microrobot transport and navigation was externally controlled by magnetic field-induced rolling, capsule loading onto the JP surface was controlled by electric field. Following precise navigation of the biohybrid microrobots to the vicinity of target tissues, the capsules were activated by a specific enzyme introduced to the solution, which then triggered tubule ejection and release of the preloaded molecules. Use of such microrobots for penetration of and delivery of the preloaded drug/toxin to targeted cancer spheroids and live Caenorhabditis elegans was demonstrated in-vitro. The findings offer insights for future development of bio-inspired microrobots capable of deep penetration and drug delivery. Future directions may involve encapsulation of various drugs within different capsule types for enhanced versatility. This study may also inspire in-vivo applications involving deep tissue drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamics from Multicellular Graphs with Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multicellular self-assembly into functional structures is a dynamic process that is critical in the development and diseases, including embryo development, organ formation, tumor invasion, and others. Being able to infer collective cell migratory dynamics from their static configuration is valuable for both understanding and predicting these complex processes. However, the identification of structural features that can indicate multicellular motion has been difficult, and existing metrics largely rely on physical instincts. Here we show that using a graph neural network (GNN), the motion of multicellular collectives can be inferred from a static snapshot of cell positions, in both experimental and synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Meta-plasticity and memory in multi-level recurrent feed-forward networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network systems can exhibit memory effects in which the interactions between different pairs of nodes adapt in time, leading to the emergence of preferred connections, patterns, and sub-networks. To a first approximation, this memory can be modelled through a ``plastic'' Hebbian or homophily mechanism, in which edges get reinforced proportionally to the amount of information flowing through them. However, recent studies on glia-neuron networks have highlighted how memory can evolve due to more complex dynamics, including multi-level network structures and ``meta-plastic'' effects that modulate reinforcement. Inspired by those systems, here we develop a simple and general model for the dynamics of an adaptive network with an additional meta-plastic mechanism that varies the rate of Hebbian strengthening of its edge connections. The meta-plastic term acts on a second network level in which edges are grouped together, simulating local, longer time-scale effects. Specifically, we consider a biased random walk on a cyclic feed-forward network. The random walk chooses its steps according to the weights of the network edges. The weights evolve through a Hebbian mechanism modulated by a meta-plastic reinforcement, biasing the walker to prefer edges that have been already explored. We study the dynamical emergence (memorisation) of preferred paths and their retrieval and identify three regimes: one dominated by the Hebbian term, one in which the meta-reinforcement drives memory formation, and a balanced one. We show that, in the latter two regimes, meta-reinforcement allows the retrieval of a previously stored path even after the weights have been reset to zero to erase Hebbian memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>
