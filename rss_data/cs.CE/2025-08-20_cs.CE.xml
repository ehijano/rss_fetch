      <title>A novel geometric predictive algorithm for assessing Compressive Elastic Modulus in MEX additive processes, based on part nonlinearities and layers stiffness,validated with PETG and PLA materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an innovative methodology based on the use of a new predictive algorithm created by the researchers capable of obtaining the elastic modulus of a plastic material manufactured with MEX and its mechanical behaviour in the elastic zone under compressive loads. The predictive algorithm only needs as input the compressive elastic modulus of the isotropic plastic material filament and the manufacturing parameters of the MEX process. The smart developed algorithm calculates the stiffness of each layer considering the number of holes in the projected area. The innovative predictive algorithm has been experimentally and numerically validated using PETG Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol material and PLA Polylactic Acid on test specimens and on a case study of variable topology. The predictive algorithm is valid for each print pattern and manufacturing direction. The new algorithm improves the existing state of the art significantly since this algorithm extends its utility to most plastic polymer materials suitable for MEX 3D printing, provided that the mechanical and elastic properties of the filament are known. Its versatility extends to complex component geometries subjected to uniaxial compression loads, eliminating the need for mechanical analysis software or expensive experimental validations.</description>

      <title>From Scores to Skills: A Cognitive Diagnosis Framework for Evaluating Financial Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for financial applications, yet their suitability for this high-stakes domain remains largely unproven due to inadequacies in existing benchmarks. Existing benchmarks solely rely on score-level evaluation, summarizing performance with a single score that obscures the nuanced understanding of what models truly know and their precise limitations. They also rely on datasets that cover only a narrow subset of financial concepts, while overlooking other essentials for real-world applications. To address these gaps, we introduce FinCDM, the first cognitive diagnosis evaluation framework tailored for financial LLMs, enabling the evaluation of LLMs at the knowledge-skill level, identifying what financial skills and knowledge they have or lack based on their response patterns across skill-tagged tasks, rather than a single aggregated number. We construct CPA-QKA, the first cognitively informed financial evaluation dataset derived from the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination, with comprehensive coverage of real-world accounting and financial skills. It is rigorously annotated by domain experts, who author, validate, and annotate questions with high inter-annotator agreement and fine-grained knowledge labels. Our extensive experiments on 30 proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs show that FinCDM reveals hidden knowledge gaps, identifies under-tested areas such as tax and regulatory reasoning overlooked by traditional benchmarks, and uncovers behavioral clusters among models. FinCDM introduces a new paradigm for financial LLM evaluation by enabling interpretable, skill-aware diagnosis that supports more trustworthy and targeted model development, and all datasets and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to support further research.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of Multi-Dimensional Breakage Population Balance Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional breakage is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems, yet the systematic discovery of underlying governing equations remains a long-standing challenge. Current inverse solution techniques are restricted to one-dimensional cases and typically depend on the availability of a priori system knowledge, thus limiting their applicability. By leveraging advances in data-driven sparse regression techniques, we develop the Multi-Dimensional Breakage Population Balance Equation Identification (mPBE ID) algorithm for discovering multi-dimensional breakage population balance equations (mPBEs) directly from data. Our mPBE-ID enables tractable identification of mPBEs by incorporating several key strategies, namely, a breakage-informed constrained sparse regression, targeted candidate library functions construction via insights from Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and robust handling of noisy/limited data through ensembling (bagging/bragging). Notably, we demonstrate how the DMD is indispensable for distilling dominant breakage dynamics which can then be used to facilitate the systematic inclusion of candidate library terms. We showcase the ability of the mPBE-ID to discover different forms of mPBE (including those with discontinuous stoichiometric kernels) even when tested against noisy and limited data. We anticipate that the mPBE-ID will serve as a foundational framework for future extensions to generalize the discovery of multi-dimensional PBEs for various high-dimensional particulate phenomena.</description>

      <title>Unified Modelling of Infrastructure Asset Performance Deterioration -- a bounded gamma process approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure asset management systems require a flexible deterioration model that can handle various degradation patterns in a unified way. Owing to its appealing monotonic sample paths, independent increments and mathematical tractability, gamma process has been widely employed as an infrastructure performance deterioration model. This model was recently enhanced by introducing an upper bound to satisfy a practical modelling need that many infrastructure performance deterioration processes are constrained by physical or managerial limits. Several bounded transformed gamma process (BTGP) alternatives had been proposed; however, they lacked due flexibility to characterize different deterioration patterns. This paper proposed a new BTGP model that is deeply grounded upon the traditional regression modelling tradition in infrastructure asset management systems. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons were carried out between the proposed BTGP and a bounded nonstationary gamma process (BNGP) model from both deterioration modelling and asset management decision-making perspectives. An empirical study using the real-world historical bridge condition data was performed to examine the flexibility of the BTGP against the BNGP and six other BTGP alternatives. The results confirmed the flexibility and significance of the proposed BTGP model for infrastructure systems.</description>

      <title>Modelling and simulation of electro-mechanically coupled dielectric elastomers and myocardial tissue using smoothed finite element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22838</link>

Abstract: Computational modelling offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to experimental studies in biomedical engineering. In cardiac electro-mechanics, finite element method (FEM)-based simulations provide valuable insights into diseased tissue behaviour and the development of assistive systems such as di-electric elastomer actuators. However, the use of automatically generated tetrahedral meshes, commonly applied due to geometric complexity, often leads to numerical issues including overly stiff responses and volume locking, particularly in incompressible materials. Smoothed finite element methods (S-FEMs) offer a promising alternative by softening the stiffness matrix through gradient smoothing over defined smoothing domains. This work extends S-FEM formulations to electro-mechanically coupled problems and compares their performance against standard linear FEM. We implement and evaluate four approaches in the Abaqus environment via custom user elements: standard linear FEM, face-based S-FEM (FS-FEM), node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM), and the hybrid face/node-based S-FEM (FSNS-FEM). Two benchmark problems are studied: the electrically induced contraction of a compressible dielectric elastomer and an incompressible, orthotropic myocardial tissue sample. Reference solutions are obtained using a mesh consisting of higher-order elements. Our results demonstrate that FSNS-FEM provides the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, closely matching reference data. NS-FEM produces softer results, which leads to an overestimation of the true deformation. FS-FEM and standard FEM consistently exhibit overly stiff behaviour, with pronounced volume locking in the myocardial case. These findings support the potential of S-FEMs, in particular FSNS-FEM, for accurate simulation of coupled electro-mechanical behaviour in complex biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Accurate identification of communication between multiple interacting neural populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.</description>
