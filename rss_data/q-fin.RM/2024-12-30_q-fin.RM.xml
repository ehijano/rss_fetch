      <title>Quantiles under ambiguity and risk sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choquet capacities and integrals are central concepts in decision making under ambiguity or model uncertainty, pioneered by Schmeidler. Motivated by risk optimization problems for quantiles under ambiguity, we study the subclass of Choquet integrals, called Choquet quantiles, which generalizes the usual (probabilistic) quantiles, also known as Value-at-Risk in finance, from probabilities to capacities. Choquet quantiles share many features with probabilistic quantiles, in terms of axiomatic representation, optimization formulas, and risk sharing. We characterize Choquet quantiles via only one axiom, called ordinality. We prove that the inf-convolution of Choquet quantiles is again a Choquet quantile, leading to explicit optimal allocations in risk sharing problems for quantile agents under ambiguity. A new class of risk measures, Choquet Expected Shortfall, is introduced, which enjoys most properties of the coherent risk measure Expected Shortfall. Our theory is complemented by optimization algorithms, numerical examples, and a stylized illustration with financial data.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous and lagged spillovers between agriculture, crude oil, carbon emission allowance, and climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the dynamic spillovers among the crude oil, carbon emission allowance, climate change, and agricultural markets. Adopting a novel $R^2$ decomposed connectedness approach, our empirical analysis reveals several key findings. The overall TCI dynamics have been mainly dominated by contemporaneous dynamics rather than the lagged dynamics. We also find climate change has significant spillovers to other markets. Moreover, there are heterogeneous spillover effects among agricultural markets. Specially, corn is the biggest risk contributor to this system, while barley is the major risk receiver of shocks.</description>

      <title>Risk spillovers between the BRICS and the U.S. staple grain futures markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines contemporaneous and lagged spillover effects in BRICS staple grain futures markets and their linkages with U.S. markets. The results show that contemporaneous spillovers dominate, while net spillovers are driven by lagged connectedness. Systemic risk is lower in intra-BRICS markets compared to those including the U.S., highlighting the U.S. grain market's significant influence. Brazilian and U.S. grains are key net spillover contributors, excluding U.S. rice, while South African staple grains act as major net receivers. Particularly, the spillover between soybeans is the strongest. The study also reveals heterogeneous impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Black Sea Grain Initiative on grain futures.</description>

      <title>DeFi Arbitrage in Hedged Liquidity Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirically, the prevailing market prices for liquidity tokens of the constant product market maker (CPMM) -- as offered in practice by companies such as Uniswap -- readily permit arbitrage opportunities by delta hedging the risk of the position. Herein, we investigate this arbitrage opportunity by treating the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the underlying assets for the CPMM. In doing so, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result, we deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas for these liquidity tokens. Furthermore, with our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) price which would not permit arbitrage if quoted by the CPMM. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM designs which would bring the pricing of liquidity tokens into the modern financial era.</description>
