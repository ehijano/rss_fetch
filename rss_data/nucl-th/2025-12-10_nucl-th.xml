      <title>Rapidly Spinning Massive Pulsars as an Indicator of Quark Deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rotating hybrid stars, with particular emphasis on the effect of spin on the deconfinement phase transition and star properties. Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state with a phase transition from hadronic matter containing hyperons to color-superconducting quark matter, where the quark phase is modeled within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the strength of the vector repulsion and diquark pairing couplings in the microscopic quark Lagrangian, we construct a set of hybrid star sequences with different quark-matter onset densities. This framework ensures consistency with astrophysical and gravitational wave constraints on mass, radius, and tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction-Based Emulation of Coupled-Channels Scattering with Non-Affinely Parametrized Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics based emulators offer a fast and reliable replacement for an exact solution of the scattering problem in nuclear physics. Previous work developed a reduced-basis emulator for single-channel elastic scattering using an optical potential. Since many reactions of interest can be cast as a coupled-channel problem, the purpose of this work is to extend the RBM to a coupled-channel framework (CC-RBM). Although the framework derived is general, in this work we apply it to reactions where the Hamiltonian coupling term comes from assuming a rotational structure model for the target. From a set of training coupled-channel wavefunctions, we perform a singular value decomposition to obtain a reduced set of basis wavefunctions, and then solve the extended (Petrov-)Galerkin equations. In addition, the empirical interpolation method is used to expand the potentials. We apply the CC-RBM method to elastic and inelastic scattering of neutrons on 48Ca including a quadrupole coupling to populate the first 2+ state, and neutrons on 208Pb, including an octupole coupling to populate its first 3- state. We demonstrate that the CC-RBM calculated cross sections match those obtained using traditional finite-difference methods. We show that the CC-RBM results can reliably reproduce the nuclear scattering cross sections at different energy regimes. The computational accuracy versus time plots demonstrate that the CC-RBM method efficiently increases precision with increasing basis size. Most importantly, for the precisions required in reaction calculations (a percent on the cross section), we find the CC-RBM method offers roughly one and a half orders of magnitude gain in computational speed compared to the traditional coupled-channels solver. However, we also discuss how this scaling becomes less favorable, the larger the number of channels included in the coupled-channel set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting matter exhibits new phases under extreme conditions. Matter was exposed to such extremes not only in the Early Universe, but also today in the cores of neutron stars, as well as in laboratory experiments at a much smaller scale. We study the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with the methods of statistical physics and explore the various phases we may encounter in experiment, such as the Quark Gluon Plasma. We briefly summarize the experimental evidence for the new forms of matter and review the theoretical efforts to embed these findings in the broader context of quantum field theory, with special attention to exact and broken symmetries and critical behaviour.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach Study of Hybrid Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how astronomical observations (specifically measurements of masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities) can constrain the presence of quark matter inside neutron stars, namely the phase transition from nuclear matter to deconfined quark matter. Our approach employs Bayesian analysis to study this phenomenon. Hadronic matter is modeled using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, for which we have selected two parameter sets: \(NL3^{*}\omega\rho\), representing hadronic matter with nucleons only, and $EL3\omega\rho$ with nucleons only and $EL3\omega\rho Y$, which includes hyperons. On the other hand deconfined quark matter is modeled using the vector-MIT bag model. For our purpose, the phase transition is implemented using the Maxwell construction. Bayesian inference is performed by tuning three parameters: the bag constant (i.e. $B^{1/4}$), the vector coupling constant \(\left(G_{v}\right)\), and the Dirac sea contribution ($b_{4}$). We found that a phase transition could exist at densities below \(2.0\,n_{0}\) for both the $EL3\omega\rho - EL3\omega\rho Y $ and $NL3^{*}\omega\rho$ parametrizations. As a consequence, our results also indicate that a hybrid neutron star could have a large quark core that comprises more than \(80\%\) of its size.</description>

      <title>Theory of inverse beta decay for reactor antineutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse beta decay (IBD), $\overline{\nu}_e p \to e^+ n \left( \gamma \right)$, is the main detection channel for reactor antineutrinos in water- and hydrocarbon-based detectors. As reactor antineutrino experiments now target sub-percent-level sensitivity to oscillation parameters, a precise theoretical description of IBD, including recoil, weak magnetism, nucleon structure, and radiative corrections, becomes essential. In this work, we give a detailed and precise calculation of the total and differential cross sections for radiative IBD, $\overline{\nu}_e p \to e^+ n \gamma$. We use a heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory framework, systematically incorporating electroweak, electromagnetic, and strong-interaction corrections. We derive new analytic cross-section expressions, clarify the collinear structure of radiative corrections, and provide a systematic uncertainty analysis. We also discuss phenomenological applications for reactor antineutrino experiments, e.g., JUNO, and neutron decay. Our results enable sub-permille theoretical precision, supporting current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>On radiative corrections to inverse beta decay at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute electromagnetic radiative corrections in the inverse beta decay, $\bar{\nu}_e + p \rightarrow e^+ + n$, at reactor antineutrino energies within the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, provide the most accurate cross-section predictions for this process, and present a complete error budget. For the first time, we consistently include quantum electrodynamics, chromodynamics, and electroweak contributions and present the positron energy spectrum accounting for radiative corrections. Our calculation also improves on previous evaluations by incorporating permille-level contributions. The results can be readily applied to normalize the reactor antineutrino flux, make precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters, and search for new physics at nuclear power plants.</description>

      <title>(3+1)D event-by-event pre-equilibrium dynamics in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: So far a major source of uncertainty in the study of heavy-ion collisions arises from the early time dynamics which includes initial state and pre-equilibrium dynamics. The state-of-the-art framework, KoMPoST, employs non-equilibrium Green's functions to propagate the initial energy-momentum tensor to the hydrodynamic phase, yet currently only treats transverse plane dynamics under boost-invariant conditions. In this work, we extend KoMPoST to include non-boost-invariant responses to initial conditions, essential for accurately capturing the longitudinal structures observed in heavy-ion collisions. Non-boost-invariant fluctuations on top of a homogeneous background are evolved using (3+1)D response functions calculated in kinetic theory. To assess kinetic theory's transition towards hydrodynamic evolution, we systematically compare the out-of-equilibrium shear-stress tensor from KoMPoST-3D with estimates based on Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. Subsequently, a comprehensive (3+1)D framework, McDIPPER+KoMPoST-3D+CLVisc+SMASH, is utilized to simulate the complete spacetime evolution of heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of key observables, including longitudinal structure of anisotropic flow, to variations in the hydrodynamic initialization time is thoroughly investigated.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Structure from Basis Light-Front Quantization : Status and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent advancements in understanding nucleon structure within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework--a fully relativistic, nonperturbative approach to solving quantum field theories. In its initial phase, we start with the leading Fock sector $|qqq\rangle$ and an effective light-front Hamiltonian incorporating confinement and one-gluon exchange within which BLFQ can already successfully describe key nucleon observables. The framework has since been extended to include the next-to-leading Fock sector $|qqqg\rangle$, enabling studies of gluonic contributions to the nucleon's internal structure, including gluon helicity, orbital angular momentum, and three-dimensional imaging through generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GPDs and TMDs). Most recently, BLFQ has achieved a significant milestone by computing nucleon light-front wavefunctions as eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian without an explicit confining potential. These calculations, including Fock sectors up to $|qqqq\bar{q}\rangle$, further develop the path to first-principles predictions of quark and gluon matter densities, helicity and transversity distributions, and spin observables, showing qualitative agreement with experimental and phenomenological results. Together, these developments highlight BLFQ's growing capacity to provide an increasingly complete and realistic picture of nucleon structure grounded in QCD.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$-Meson Nucleon Scattering Length from Threshold Photoproduction on Light Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of recent SRC/CT Collaboration $J/\psi$ photoproduction data off a $^4$He target from Hall~D at Jefferson Laboratory, combined with the feasibility of measuring the reaction close to the free-nucleon energy threshold, opens the door to using incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction to access a variety of interesting physics aspects. An example is an estimate of the $J/\psi~p$ scattering length $|\alpha_{J/\psi~p}|$ on the bound proton obtained using the Vector Meson Dominance model. This value can be compared with that of the free proton from the GlueX Collaboration. One may then project what would be expected from the SRC/CT Collaboration Experiment E12--25--002, which was recently approved by the JLab PAC. Using a plane-wave theoretical model to generate quasi-data, we find the experiment could achieve a result of $|\alpha_{J/\psi~p}| = 3.08\pm 0.45~\mathrm{mfm}$, an uncertainty competitive with that of the free-proton measurement. A comparison between the two would allow an evaluation of the effects of medium modification in the case of light nuclei.</description>

      <title>The Radius of PSR J0437-4715 from NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data have been used to estimate the masses and radii of the rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, PSR J0437$-$4715, PSR J1231$-$1411, and PSR J0614$-$3329, sometimes in joint analyses with X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) data. These measurements provide invaluable information about the properties of cold, catalyzed matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Here we present the results of our modeling of NICER data on PSR J0437$-$4715 using several different models of hot thermal X-ray emitting spots on the stellar surface. For this pulsar, previous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations established that there is also a modulated nonthermal component to the emission, but the previously published analysis of NICER data did not model this component. We find that the Bayesian evidence is significantly higher when the modulated nonthermal component is included, and that omission of this component leads to poor fits to the bolometric NICER data and thus risks bias in the resulting radius estimates. Our models, which we pursue to inferential convergence, therefore have modulated nonthermal emission, and our headline model has in addition three uniform-temperature thermally-emitting circular spots. Using this model, the symmetric 68% credible range in the radius is 11.8 km to 15.1 km, which at the independently-measured mass of $M=1.418\pm 0.044~M_\odot$ is consistent with previous reports of the radius of the $\sim 1.4~M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0030$+$0451. We discuss the implications of this measurement for the equation of state of dense matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the critical temperature of a relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate of charged bosons driven by rotation in a parallel magnetic field [Y. Liu and I. Zahed, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 032001 (2018)]. For non-interacting bosons, the critical temperature can only be determined for a system with fixed angular momentum. We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the leading-power fragmentation of fully charmed pentaquark states ($S$-wave $|c\bar{c}ccc\rangle$ pentacharms) at hadron colliders. We introduce a new set of multimodal collinear fragmentation functions, named PQ5Q1.0. They rely on an enhanced calculation of the initial-scale input for the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel, making them well suited to describe the short-distance emission of either a compact multicharm state or a dicharm-charm-dicharm configuration. To explore phenomenological implications, we use the (sym)JETHAD multimodular interface to study NLL/NLO$^+$ semi-inclusive production rates for pentacharm-plus-jet systems at the forthcoming HL-LHC and the future FCC. Our analysis represents a further step toward bridging the domains of hadronic structure, precision QCD, and exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Indications for freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The D-measure of net-charge fluctuations quantifies the variance of net charge in strongly interacting matter. It was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>Investigating nuclear effects in lepton-ion DIS at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the far-forward physics program of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be useful to probe the hadron structure with GeV-TeV neutrinos and muons. In particular, these studies indicate that the measurement of the muon-ion and neutrino-ion cross-sections by the same experiment is feasible. In this paper, we investigate the impact of nuclear effects on the muon-tungsten ($\mu W$) and neutrino-tungsten ($\nu W$) deep inelastic scattering (DIS) events at FASER$\nu$ and its proposed upgrade FASER$\nu 2$. We estimate the rates associated with the inclusive cross-sections and for events with a charm tagged in the final state considering different parameterizations for the nuclear parton distribution functions. These results point out that muon and neutrino-induced interactions probe complementary kinematical ranges and that a simultaneous analysis of associated events will allow to test the universality (or not) of the nuclear effects. Moreover, we propose the study of the ratio between the charm tagged and inclusive events in order to discriminate between the distinct modeling of the nuclear effects at small-$x$. Our results indicate that a future experimental reconstruction of $\mu W$ and $\nu W$ DIS events at the LHC is a promising way to improve our understanding of nuclear effects and decrease the current uncertainties in parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Coherent and incoherent antineutrino scattering on stable even-even isotopes of molybdenum detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observations of the coherent neutrino- and antineutrino-nucleus scattering have opened up a plethora of opportunities to probe physics within standard and non-standard theories of the electroweak interactions. In the present article, our goal is to explore the possibility of using the molybdenum material as detection medium for coherent and incoherent antineutrino- and neutrino- Mo scattering in the ongoing and future coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE{\nu}NS) experiments by using relevant (anti-)neutrino beams as e.g. stopped pion-decay neutrino beams, reactor antineutrino beams, astrophysical (solar or supernova) (anti)neutrino beams, etc. Our present coherent and incoherent scattering cross sections of Mo isotopes with neutrinos and antineutrinos are based on the deformed shell model (DSM) that has been previously employed for studying similar processes. On the other hand, in the past, CE{\nu}NS events obtained with this model provided us with better fits to COHERENT experimental data compared to phenomenological form factors.</description>

      <title>Is The Trace Anomaly at its Minimum Value at Neutron Star Centers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\phi = P/\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\Delta = 1/3 - \phi$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.</description>
