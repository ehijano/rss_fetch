      <title>Finsler Metric Clustering in Weighted Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a hierarchical clustering algorithm for weighted projective spaces $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{q}}$, utilizing a Finsler metric $ d_F([z], [w]) $ and its rational analogue $ d_{F,\mathbb{Q}}([z], [w])$ to define distances that preserve the non-Euclidean geometry of these quotient manifolds. Defined via geodesic integrals of a scaling invariant Finsler norm weighted by the grades $\mathbf{q} = (q_0, q_1, \dots, q_n)$, these metrics satisfy true metric properties including the triangle inequality, overcoming the limitations of the non-metric dissimilarity measure from prior work.</description>

      <title>Toponogov comparison and the collar theorem for complete surfaces with an appendix on the level sets of distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970s, the collar theorem was proven, establishing the existence of uniform tubular neighborhoods of simple closed geodesics on compact surfaces, whose widths depend only on the lengths of the geodesics and the lower bound of the curvature, but not on the surface. In this paper, we improve this result by eliminating the compactness hypothesis. To achieve this result, we needed to prove new Toponogov-type triangle comparison theorems. We also add a new theorem to the literature on the rectifiabilty of the level sets of the distance function, with the corollary that on thin infinite cylinders with geodesic boundary all sets of constant distance to the boundary are simple closed Lipschitz curves.</description>

      <title>Complete two-sided $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbf R^{n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complete $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbf R^{n+1}$. We prove that complete two-sided $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces have Euclidean volume growth if $3\leq n\leq 5$ and $\delta&gt;\delta_0(n)$, where $\delta_0(3)=1/3$, $\delta_0(4)=1/2$ and $\delta_0(5)=21/22$. We also give a sufficient condition such that complete two-sided $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbf R^{n+1}$ is the hyperplane. Furthermore, we prove that a complete two-sided $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurface is the hyperplane if $3\leq n\leq 5$ and $\delta&gt;\delta_1(n)$, where $\delta_1(3)=3/8$, $\delta_1(4)=2/3$ and $\delta_1(5)=21/22$.</description>

      <title>Geodesic orbit pseudo-Riemannian H-type nilmanifolds: case of minimal admissible Clifford modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geodesic orbit property of pseudo-Riemannian nilmanifolds, specifically those known in the literature as pseudo $H$-type Lie groups -- i.e., 2-step nilpotent Lie groups of Heisenberg type equipped with a left invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric. The study of homogeneous geodesics on Riemannian $H$-type Lie groups was completed by C.~Riehm in 1984. In this work, we extend these results to the pseudo-Riemannian $H$-type Lie groups and provide a complete characterization of the geodesic orbit property for the case where the underlying Lie algebras are constructed from the admissible Clifford modules of minimal dimension.</description>

      <title>Universal non-CD of sub-Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a sub-Riemannian manifold equipped with a full-support Radon measure is never $\mathrm{CD}(K,N)$ for any $K\in \mathbb{R}$ and $N\in (1,\infty)$ unless it is Riemannian. This generalizes previous non-CD results for sub-Riemannian manifolds, where a measure with smooth and positive density is considered. Our proof is based on the analysis of the tangent cones and the geodesics within. Secondly, we construct new $\mathrm{RCD}$ structures on $\mathbb{R}^n$, named cone-Grushin spaces, that fail to be sub-Riemannian due to the lack of a scalar product along a curve, yet exhibit characteristic features of sub-Riemannian geometry, such as horizontal directions, large Hausdorff dimension, and inhomogeneous metric dilations.</description>

      <title>Geometric Gaussian Approximations of Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating complex probability distributions, such as Bayesian posterior distributions, is of central interest in many applications. We study the expressivity of geometric Gaussian approximations. These consist of approximations by Gaussian pushforwards through diffeomorphisms or Riemannian exponential maps. We first review these two different kinds of geometric Gaussian approximations. Then we explore their relationship to one another. We further provide a constructive proof that such geometric Gaussian approximations are universal, in that they can capture any probability distribution. Finally, we discuss whether, given a family of probability distributions, a common diffeomorphism can be found to obtain uniformly high-quality geometric Gaussian approximations for that family.</description>

      <title>A smooth family of $G_2$-instantons over a generalised Kummer construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a smooth 1-parameter family of $G_2$-instantons over a generalised Kummer construction desingularising a $G_2$-orbifold discovered by Joyce. For this we extend the gluing construction for $G_2$-instantons developed by Walpuski to Kummer constructions resolving $G_2$-orbifolds whose singular strata are of codimension 6 and to connections (and entire families of connections) whose linearised instanton operator has a non-trivial cokernel. In order to overcome the corresponding obstructions, we utilise a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action on the ambient manifold. More precisely, we perturb the (family of) pre-glued almost-instantons inside the class of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant connections, which has the advantage that only the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant locus of the cokernel needs to vanish. We then prove that the instantons that we construct over the resolution of the orbifold found by Joyce are all infinitesimally rigid and non-flat. Moreover, we show that the resulting curve into the moduli space of $G_2$-instantons modulo gauge is injective, that is, no two distinct instantons within the family are gauge-equivalent. To the author's knowledge this is the first example of a smooth 1-parameter family of instantons over a compact $G_2$-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study and analyze the \phi-sectional curvature induced by a statistical structure on an almost contact metric manifold. We demonstrate that this sectional curvature is always non-positive. Additionally, we present equivalent statements regarding the vanishing of this type of sectional curvature. Furthermore, we derive a sufficient condition for an almost contact statistical manifold to be classified as a cosymplectic statistical manifold.</description>

      <title>Connection stability of vector fields with astrophysical application to the Einstein-Vlasov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a method for considering the stability of smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold which may not be compact. We show that these kind of stability which is called "connection stability" is equivalent to the structural stability in the case of compact manifolds. We prove if X is a connection stable vector field, then any multiplication of it by a nonzero scalar is also a connection stable vector field. We present an example of a connection stable vector field on a noncompact manifold, and we also show that harmonic oscillator is not a connection stable vector field. We present a technique to prove a class of vector fields are not connection stable. As a concrete physical example, we will apply the analysis to the Einstein- Vlasov system in an astrophysical context in which we propose an approach that could, in principle and partially, help to understand the problem of galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Non-spectrality of some piecewise smooth curves and unions of line segments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic study about the spectrality of measures supported on piecewise smooth curves by studying the support of the tempered distributions arising from the tiling equation of some singular spectral measures. In doing so, we show that the arc-length measures of all closed polygonal lines are not spectral. {In particular, the boundary of a square is not spectral. We also show that the ``plus space'' (two crossing line segments) is not spectral.} Furthermore, our theory also shows that the arc length measures on {smooth} convex curves with finitely many transverse self-intersections are not spectral. Finally, several natural open questions about the spectrality of singular measures and {piecewise} smooth curves will also be discussed.</description>

Abstract: We prove that irreducible Calabi-Yau varieties of a fixed dimension, admitting a fibration by abelian varieties or primitive symplectic varieties of a fixed analytic deformation class, are birationally bounded. We prove that there are only finitely many deformation classes of primitive symplectic varieties of a fixed dimension, admitting a Lagrangian fibration. We also show that fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds are bounded. Conditional on the generalized abundance or hyperk\"ahler SYZ conjecture, our results prove that there are only finitely many deformation classes of hyperk\"ahler varieties, of a fixed dimension, with $b_2 \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature comparison and rigidity of $3$-dimensional weakly convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a compact Riemannian $3$-manifold $(M^{3}, g)$ with mean convex boundary which is diffeomorphic to a weakly convex compact domain in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, we prove that if scalar curvature is nonnegative and the scaled mean curvature comparison $H^{2}g \ge H_{0}^{2} g_{Eucl}$ holds, then $(M,g)$ is flat. Our result is a smooth analog of Gromov's dihedral rigidity conjecture and an effective version of extremity results on weakly convex balls in $\mathbb R^3$. More generally, we prove the comparison and rigidity theorem for several classes of manifold with corners. Our proof uses capillary minimal surfaces with prescribed contact angle together with the construction of foliation with nonnegative mean curvature and with prescribed contact angles.</description>

Abstract: We discuss complex quaternionic manifolds, i.e., those that have holonomy $GL(n,\mathbb{H})U(1)$, which naturally arise via quaternionic Feix--Kaledin construction. We show that for a fixed c-projective class, any real analytic connection with type $(1,1)$ curvature induces, via quaternionic Feix--Kaledin construction, an $S^1$-invariant connection with holonomy contained in $GL(n,\mathbb{H})U(1)$. As an application, we characterize in this setting the distinguished $U^*(2n):=SL(n,\mathbb{H})U(1)$ connection studied in Battaglia \cite{Bat} and Hitchin \cite{Hit3}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12479v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: J. Rosenberg's $\mathbb{S}^1$-stability conjecture states that a closed oriented manifold $X$ admits a positive scalar curvature metric iff $X\times \mathbb{S}^1$ admits a positive scalar curvature metric $h$. As pointed out by J. Rosenberg and others, there are known counterexamples in dimension four. We prove this conjecture whenever $h$ satisfies a geometric bound which measures the discrepancy between $\partial_\theta\in T\mathbb{S}^1$ and the normal vector field to $X\times \{P\}$, for a fixed $P\in \mathbb{S}^1.$</description>

      <title>Pluripotential theory and special holonomy, I: Hodge decompositions and $\partial\bar\partial$ lemmata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact torsion-free $G_2$ 7-manifold or Calabi-Yau 6-manifold. We prove Hodge decomposition theorems for the $dd^\phi$ operators, introduced by Harvey and Lawson, which generalize the $i\partial\bar\partial$ operator used in classical pluripotential theory. We then obtain analogues of the $\partial\bar\partial$ lemma in this context. We formalize this by defining cohomology spaces analogous to Bott-Chern cohomology and we relate them to harmonic forms on $M$.
  In the $G_2$ case we provide a geometric interpretation of the corresponding cohomology classes in terms of coassociative submanifolds and gerbes: this is analogous to the classical interpretation of Bott-Chern cohomology classes in terms of divisors and holomorphic line bundles.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group $N$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{n}$ is
  $p$-filiform. We show that $\Gamma$ is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental
  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension less than or
  equal to six to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The speed of a ball rolling without skidding or spinning on a surface $S$ is the length of the velocity of its center, or, equivalently, the length of its angular velocity vector. We show that if the speed only depends on $p\in S$, then $S$ has nonzero constant mean curvature; and, conversely, that if the mean curvature of $S$ is constant and equal to $H\neq 0$, then either $S$ is a sphere or the ball of radius $1/H$ rolls on $S$ with direction-independent speed. It follows that the only surfaces where the speed is constant are subsets of planes, circular cylinders, and spheres.</description>

      <title>Classification of Toda-type tt*-structures and $\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$-fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify Toda-type tt*-structures in terms of the anti-symmetry condition. A Toda-type tt*-structure is a flat bundle whose flatness condition is the tt*-Toda equation (Guest-Its-Lin). We show that the Toda-type tt*-structure can be described as a fixed point of $e^{\sqrt{-1}\frac{2\pi}{n+1}}$-multiplication and this ``intrinsic'' description reduces the possibilities of the anti-symmetry condition to only two cases. We give an application to the relation between tt*-Toda equations and representation theory.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic bundles framed along a real hypersurface and the Riemann-Hilbert problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a connected, compact complex manifold and $S\subset X$ a separating real hypersurface, so that $X$ decomposes as a union of compact complex manifolds with boundary $\bar X^\pm$. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the moduli space of $S$-framed holomorphic bundles, i.e. of pairs $(E,\theta)$ of fixed topological type consisting of a holomorphic bundle $E$ on $X$ and a trivialization $\theta$ - belonging to a fixed H\"older regularity class $\mathcal{C}^{\kappa+1}$ - of its restriction to $S$.
  The restrictions to $\bar X^\pm$ of an $S$-framed holomorphic bundle $(E,\theta)$ are boundary framed formally holomorphic bundles $(E^\pm,\theta^\pm)$ which induce, via $\theta^\pm$, the same tangential Cauchy-Riemann operators on the trivial bundle on $S$, so one obtains a natural map from $\mathcal{M}$ into the fiber product $\mathcal{M}^-\times_\mathcal{C}\mathcal{M}^+$ over the space $\mathcal{C}$ of Cauchy-Riemann operators on the trivial bundle on $S$. Our main result states: this map is a homeomorphism for $\kappa\in (0,\infty]\setminus\mathbb{N}$.
  The proof is based on a gluing principle for formally holomorphic bundles along a real hypersurface. This principle can also be used to give a complex geometric interpretation of the space of solutions of a large class of Riemann-Hilbert type problems. The results generalize in two directions: first one can replace the decomposition associated with a separating hypersurface by the the manifold with boundary $\widehat X_S$ obtained by cutting $X$ along any oriented hypersurface $S$. Second one can consider principal $G$ bundles for an arbitrary complex Lie group $G$. We give explicit examples of moduli spaces of (boundary) framed holomorphic bundles and explicit formulae for the homeomorphisms provided by the general results.</description>

      <title>Super-$\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$ T-Duality and M-Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super $L_\infty$-algebras unify extended super-symmetry with rational classifying spaces for higher flux densities: The super-invariant super-fluxes which control super $p$-branes and their supergravity target super-spaces are, together with their (non-linear) Bianchi identities, neatly encoded in (non-abelian) super-$L_\infty$ cocycles. These are the rational shadows of flux-quantization laws (in ordinary cohomology, K-theory, Cohomotopy, iterated K-theory, etc).
  We first review, in streamlined form while filling some previous gaps, double-dimensional reduction/oxidation and 10D superspace T-duality along higher-dimensional super-tori. We do so tangent super-space wise, by viewing it as an instance of adjunctions (dualities) between super-$L_\infty$-extensions and -cyclifications, applied to the avatar super-flux densities of 10D supergravity. In particular, this yields a derivation, at the rational level, of the traditional laws of "topological T-duality" from the super-$L_\infty$ structure of type II superspace. At this level, we also discuss a higher categorical analog of T-duality involving M-branes.
  Then, by considering super-space T-duality along all 1+9 spacetime dimensions while retaining the 11th dimension as in F-theory, we find the M-algebra appearing as the complete brane-charge extension of the fully T-doubled/correspondence super-spacetime. On this backdrop, we recognize the "decomposed" M-theory 3-form on the "hidden M-algebra" as an M-theoretic lift of the Poincar\'e super 2-form that controls superspace T-duality as the integral kernel of the super Fourier-Mukai transform. This provides the super-space structure of an M-theory lift of the doubled/correspondence space geometry, which controls T-duality.</description>
