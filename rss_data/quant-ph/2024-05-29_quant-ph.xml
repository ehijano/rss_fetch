      <title>eQMARL: Entangled Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Cooperation over Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration is a key challenge in distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments. Learning frameworks for these decentralized systems must weigh the benefits of explicit player coordination against the communication overhead and computational cost of sharing local observations and environmental data. Quantum computing has sparked a potential synergy between quantum entanglement and cooperation in multi-agent environments, which could enable more efficient distributed collaboration with minimal information sharing. This relationship is largely unexplored, however, as current state-of-the-art quantum MARL (QMARL) implementations rely on classical information sharing rather than entanglement over a quantum channel as a coordination medium. In contrast, in this paper, a novel framework dubbed entangled QMARL (eQMARL) is proposed. The proposed eQMARL is a distributed actor-critic framework that facilitates cooperation over a quantum channel and eliminates local observation sharing via a quantum entangled split critic. Introducing a quantum critic uniquely spread across the agents allows coupling of local observation encoders through entangled input qubits over a quantum channel, which requires no explicit sharing of local observations and reduces classical communication overhead. Further, agent policies are tuned through joint observation-value function estimation via joint quantum measurements, thereby reducing the centralized computational burden. Experimental results show that eQMARL with ${\Psi}^{+}$ entanglement converges to a cooperative strategy up to $17.8\%$ faster and with a higher overall score compared to split classical and fully centralized classical and quantum baselines. The results also show that eQMARL achieves this performance with a constant factor of $25$-times fewer centralized parameters compared to the split classical baseline.</description>

      <title>Effects of external field and potential on non-relativistic quantum particles in disclinations background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-relativistic quantum particles immersed in a cosmic string space-time background. Our study involves the examination of these particles as they interact with a range of influences, including potential, magnetic, and quantum flux fields. We employ analytical methods to solve the associated wave equation, leading to the derivation of eigenvalue solutions for this quantum system. Subsequently, we leverage these eigenvalue solutions to scrutinize several potential models. For each model, we present and engage in a thorough discussion of the corresponding eigenvalue solutions. In an extension of our investigation, we explore the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the quantum system when it is exposed to non-zero temperature conditions, denoted by $T \neq 0$. Our analysis encompasses the calculation of essential parameters such as the partition function for the system and other pertinent functions. Following these calculations, we meticulously examine and interpret the outcomes, shedding light on the system's behavior and characteristics in the presence of temperature variations. Furthermore, we calculate entropic information to investigate the location of particles in the system.</description>

      <title>Approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a family of approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquid problems. These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly out-perform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code model, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N=480), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures</description>

      <title>The MQT Handbook: A Summary of Design Automation Tools and Software for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are becoming a reality and numerous quantum computing applications with a near-term perspective (e.g., for finance, chemistry, machine learning, and optimization) and with a long-term perspective (e.g., for cryptography or unstructured search) are currently being investigated. However, designing and realizing potential applications for these devices in a scalable fashion requires automated, efficient, and user-friendly software tools that cater to the needs of end users, engineers, and physicists at every level of the entire quantum software stack. Many of the problems to be tackled in that regard are similar to design problems from the classical realm for which sophisticated design automation tools have been developed in the previous decades.
  The Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) is a collection of software tools for quantum computing developed by the Chair for Design Automation at the Technical University of Munich which explicitly utilizes this design automation expertise. Our overarching objective is to provide solutions for design tasks across the entire quantum software stack. This entails high-level support for end users in realizing their applications, efficient methods for the classical simulation, compilation, and verification of quantum circuits, tools for quantum error correction, support for physical design, and more. These methods are supported by corresponding data structures (such as decision diagrams) and core methods (such as SAT encodings/solvers). All of the developed tools are available as open-source implementations and are hosted on https://github.com/cda-tum.</description>

      <title>Operator representation of spatiotemporal quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum correlations between two spacelike-separated systems are fully encoded by the bipartite density operator associated with the joint system, we prove that there does not exist an operator representation for general quantum correlations across space and time. This is in stark contrast to the case of classical random variables, which make no distinction between spacelike and timelike correlations. Despite this, we show that in the restricted setting of spatiotemporal correlations between light-touch observables (i.e., observables with only one singular value), there exists a unique operator representation of such spatiotemporal correlations for arbitrary timelike-separated quantum systems. A special case of our result reproduces generalized Pauli observables and pseudo-density matrices, which have, up until now, only been defined for multi-qubit systems. In the case of qutrit systems, we use our results to illustrate an intriguing connection between light-touch observables and symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVMs).</description>

      <title>The set of Kirkwood-Dirac positive states is almost always minimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in quantum information is determining quantum-classical boundaries. A useful notion of classicality is provided by the quasiprobability formulation of quantum theory. In this framework, a state is called classical if it is represented by a quasiprobability distribution that is positive, and thus a probability distribution. In recent years, the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distributions have gained much interest due to their numerous applications in modern quantum-information research. A particular advantage of the KD distributions is that they can be defined with respect to arbitrary observables. Here, we show that if two observables are picked at random, the set of classical states of the resulting KD distribution is a simple polytope of minimal size. When the Hilbert space is of dimension $d$, this polytope is of dimension $2d-1$ and has $2d$ known vertices. Our result implies, $\textit{e.g.}$, that almost all KD distributions have resource theories in which the free states form a small and simple set.</description>

      <title>Wigner's Theorem for stabilizer states and quantum designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the symmetry group of the stabilizer polytope for any number $n$ of systems and any prime local dimension $d$. In the qubit case, the symmetry group coincides with the linear and anti-linear Clifford operations. In the case of qudits, the structure is somewhat richer: for $n=1$, it is a wreath product of permutations of bases and permutations of the elements within each basis. For $n&gt;1$, the symmetries are given by affine symplectic similitudes. These are the affine maps that preserve the symplectic form of the underlying discrete phase space up to a non-zero multiplier. We phrase these results with respect to a number of a priori different notions of "symmetry'', including Kadison symmetries (bijections that are compatible with convex combinations), Wigner symmetries (bijections that preserve inner products), and symmetries realized by an action on Hilbert space. Going beyond stabilizer states, we extend an observation of Heinrich and Gross (Ref. [25]) and show that the symmetries of fairly general sets of Hermitian operators are constrained by certain moments. In particular: the symmetries of a set that behaves like a 3-design preserve Jordan products and are therefore realized by conjugation with unitaries or anti-unitaries. (The structure constants of the Jordan algebra are encoded in an order-three tensor, which we connect to the third moments of a design). This generalizes Kadison's formulation of the classic Wigner Theorem on quantum mechanical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Strategic Code: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Quantum Error-Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting code (QECC) is the central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum information processing. An emerging paradigm of dynamical QECC shows that one can robustly encode logical quantum information both temporally and spatially in a more resource-efficient manner than traditional QECCs. Nevertheless, an overarching theory of how dynamical QECCs achieve fault-tolerance is lacking. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a unified spatio-temporal QECC framework called the ``strategic code'' built around an ``interrogator'' device which sequentially measures and evolves the spatial QECC in an adaptive manner based on the ``quantum combs'' formalism, a generalization of the channel-state duality. The strategic code covers all existing dynamical and static QECC, as well as all physically plausible QECCs to be discovered in the future, including those that involve adaptivity in its operational dynamics. Within this framework, we show an algebraic and an information-theoretic necessary and sufficient error-correction conditions for a strategic code, which consider spatially and temporally correlated errors. These conditions include the analogous known static QECC conditions as a special case. Lastly, we also propose an optimization-theoretic approach to obtain an approximate strategic code adapting to a correlated error.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Quantum Teleportation of Two-Qubit Entangled States by using Six-Qubit Cluster State and Six-Qubit Entangled State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic quantum teleportation schemes requires at least the existence of three collaborators acting all as senders and receivers of quantum information, each one of them has an information to be transmitted to the next neighbour in a circular manner. Here, new cyclic quantum teleportation scheme is proposed for perfectly transmitting cyclically three arbitrary unknown two-qubit states ($\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$) among the three collaborators. In this scheme, Alice can send to Bob the quantum information contained in her two-qubit state $\alpha$ and receive from Charlie the quantum information contained in the two-qubit state in his possession $\gamma$ and similarly, Bob can transmit to Charlie the quantum information contained in his two-qubit state $\beta$ through a quantum channel of twelve-qubit state consisting of a six-qubit cluster state and a six-qubit entangled state by sequentially and cyclically performing Bell state measurements. Subsequently, each one of the three participants can afterwards retrieve his own desired two-qubit state using classical channel and by performing appropriate unitary Pauli operators and we have shown that our proposed scheme performs efficiently.</description>

Abstract: The intersection between quantum computing and optimisation has been an area of interest in recent years. There have been numerous studies exploring the application of quantum and quantum-hybrid solvers to various optimisation problems. This work explores scalarisation methods within the context of solving the bi-objective quadratic assignment problem using a quantum-hybrid solver. We show results that are consistent with previous research on a different Ising machine.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit Lattice Surgery Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation using two-dimensional topological quantum error correcting codes can benefit from multi-qubit long-range operations. By using simple commutation rules, a quantum circuit can be transpiled into a sequence of solely non-Clifford multi-qubit gates. Prior work on fault-tolerant compilation avoids optimal scheduling of such gates since they reduce the parallelizability of the circuit. We observe that the reduced parallelization potential is outweighed by the significant reduction in the number of gates. We therefore devise a method for scheduling multi-qubit lattice surgery using an earliest-available-first policy, solving the associated forest packing problem using a representation of the multi-qubit gates as Steiner trees. Our extensive testing on random and application-inspired circuits demonstrates the method's scalability and performance. We show that the transpilation significantly reduces the circuit length on the set of circuits tested, and that the resulting circuit of multi-qubit gates has a further reduction in the expected circuit execution time compared to serial execution.</description>

      <title>Phonon Number Measurement Using Optimal Composite Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the phonon number of the laser-cooled ions is an indispensable step in evaluating whether an ion is in ground state. At present, commonly used methods in the experiments are red-to-blue sideband ratios and adiabatic evolution red-sideband methods. We theoretically propose a method using composite pulses which does not need a fit of state evolution and can directly measure the population of the selected Fock state. It can measure higher Fock state population more directly comparing with the adiabatic evolution red-sideband method. We use quantum optimal control method to improve the fidelity of unitary operation of the composite pulses. With quantum optimal control technology, we can discuss the situation where the laser strength is strong, and many approximations will not be necessary, where the gate fidelity can be further improved. Then we give a method to modify the measurement result for a higher accuracy which has a good performance, and we give an example to illustrate its application on high Fock state measurement.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian Topology of Multiband Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex eigenenergies and non-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique topological phenomena that cannot appear in Hermitian systems. Representative examples are the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points. In a two-dimensional parameter space, topological classifications of non-separable bands in multiband non-Hermitian systems can be established by invoking a permutation group, where the product of the permutation represents state exchange due to exceptional points in the space. We unveil in this work the role of pseudo-Hermitian lines in non-Hermitian topology for multiple bands. Contrary to current understanding, the non-separability of non-Hermitian multibands can be topologically non-trivial without exceptional points in two-dimensional space. Our work builds on the fundamental and comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian multiband systems and also offers versatile applications and realizations of non-Hermitian systems without the need to consider exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Capturing dynamics and thermodynamics of a three-level quantum heat engine via programmable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research employs the Kraus representation and Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem to model a three-level quantum heat on quantum circuits, investigating its dynamic evolution and thermodynamic performance. The feasibility of the dynamic model is validated by tracking the changes of population. On the basis of reinforcement learning algorithm, the optimal cycle of the quantum heat engine for maximal average power is proposed and verified by the thermodynamic model. The stability of quantum circuit simulations is scrutinized through a comparative analysis of theoretical and simulated results, predicated on an orthogonal test. These results affirm the practicality of simulating quantum heat engines on quantum circuits, offering potential for substantially curtailing the experimental expenses associated with the construction of such engines.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-induced bound states as a two-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential wells are employed to constrain quantum particles into forming discrete energy levels, acting as artificial few-level systems. In contrast, an anti-parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric system can have a single pair of real energy levels, while all the remaining levels are unstable due to the negative imaginary part of the energy. In this work, we investigate the formation of bound states in a tight-binding chain induced by a harmonic imaginary potential. Exact solutions show that the real parts of energy levels are equidistant, while the imaginary parts are semi-negative definite and equidistant. This allows for the formation of an effective two-level system. For a given initial state with a wide range of profiles, the evolved state always converges to a superposition of two stable eigenstates. In addition, these two states are orthogonal under the Dirac inner product and can be mutually switched by applying a $\pi$ pulse of a linear field. Our finding provides an alternative method for fabricating quantum devices through dissipation.</description>

      <title>Programmable Nonlinear Quantum Photonic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of interactions between single photons prohibits direct nonlinear operations in quantum optical circuits, representing a central obstacle in photonic quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate multi-mode nonlinear photonic circuits where both linear and direct nonlinear operations can be programmed with high precision at the single-photon level. Deterministic nonlinear interaction is realized with a tunable quantum dot embedded in a nanophotonic waveguide mediating interactions between individual photons within a temporal linear optical interferometer. We demonstrate the capability to reprogram the nonlinear photonic circuits and implement protocols where strong nonlinearities are required, in particular for quantum simulation of anharmonic molecular dynamics, thereby showcasing the new key functionalities enabled by our technology.</description>

      <title>The communication power of a noisy qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental property of quantum mechanics is that a single qubit can carry at most 1 bit of classical information. For an important class of quantum communication channels, known as entanglement-breaking, this limitation remains valid even if the sender and receiver share entangled particles before the start of the communication: for every entanglement-breaking channel, the rate at which classical messages can be reliably communicated cannot exceed 1 bit per transmitted qubit even with the assistance of quantum entanglement. But does this mean that, for the purpose of communicating classical messages, a noisy entanglement-breaking qubit channel can be replaced by a noisy bit channel? Here we answer the question in the negative. We introduce a game where a player (the sender) assists another player (the receiver) in finding a prize hidden into one of four possible boxes, while avoiding a bomb hidden in one of the three remaining boxes. In this game, the bomb cannot be avoided with certainty if the players communicate through a noisy bit channel. In contrast, the players can deterministically avoid the bomb and find the prize with a guaranteed 1/3 probability if they communicate through an entanglement-breaking qubit channel known as the universal NOT channel. We show that the features of the quantum strategy can be simulated with a noiseless bit channel, but this simulation requires the transmission to be assisted by shared randomness: without shared randomness, even the noiseless transmission of a three-level classical system cannot match the transmission of a single noisy qubit.</description>

      <title>An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an even-parity precession protocol that can detect nonclassicality of some quantum states using only measurements of a uniformly-precessing variable at different points in time. Depending on the system under study, the protocol may detect the Wigner negativity of a single quantum harmonic oscillator or of a single spin $j\geq 2$; the non-Gaussian entanglement of two harmonic oscillators; or genuine multipartite entanglement of a spin ensemble, whose total spin is integer. Unlike other nonclassicality tests, simultaneous or sequential measurements are not required. Our protocol can also detect states that commute with the parity operator, which were missed by similar protocols built from Tsirelson's original precession protocol. This work also closes a long-standing gap by showing the possibility of detecting the Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger entanglement of an even number of qubits using only collective spin measurements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oscillating bound state is a phenomenon where excitations mediated by the continuum modes oscillate persistently. Although it is generated by the superposition of two bound states in the continuum (BICs), such phenomenon is said to be unique to giant atoms. We present the phenomenon of an oscillating bound state with an alternative waveguide QED system, which is a one-dimensional semi-infinite waveguide coupled to a \textit{point-like} quantum emitter. This \textit{point-like} quantum emitter is $\Lambda$-type quantum system with one transition driven by a classical field.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for block encoding of structured matrices in ocean acoustics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block encoding is a data input model commonly used in a quantum computer. It is a technique that embeds a matrix $A$ satisfying $\left\|A\right\| \leq 1$ into a larger unitary matrix $U_{A}$. We consider special structured matrices arising from generalized eigenvalue equations in ocean acoustics. We develop their block encoding scheme and further improve it which results lower subnormalisations. And we discuss how to construct quantum circuits of block encoding for the structured matrices. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the feasibility of our block encoding schemes. The corresponding codes of the quantum circuits in \verb|MATLAB| are also presented.</description>

      <title>An on-demand resource allocation algorithm for a quantum network hub and its performance analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively support the execution of quantum network applications for multiple sets of user-controlled quantum nodes, a quantum network must efficiently allocate shared resources. We study traffic models for a type of quantum network hub called an Entanglement Generation Switch (EGS), a device that allocates resources to enable entanglement generation between nodes in response to user-generated demand. We propose an on-demand resource allocation algorithm, where a demand is either blocked if no resources are available or else results in immediate resource allocation. We model the EGS as an Erlang loss system, with demands corresponding to sessions whose arrival is modelled as a Poisson process. To reflect the operation of a practical quantum switch, our model captures scenarios where a resource is allocated for batches of entanglement generation attempts, possibly interleaved with calibration periods for the quantum network nodes. Calibration periods are necessary to correct against drifts or jumps in the physical parameters of a quantum node that occur on a timescale that is long compared to the duration of an attempt. We then derive a formula for the demand blocking probability under three different traffic scenarios using analytical methods from applied probability and queueing theory. We prove an insensitivity theorem which guarantees that the probability a demand is blocked only depends upon the mean duration of each entanglement generation attempt and calibration period, and is not sensitive to the underlying distributions of attempt and calibration period duration. We provide numerical results to support our analysis. Our work is the first analysis of traffic characteristics at an EGS system and provides a valuable analytic tool for devising performance driven resource allocation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Autoencoder Architectures for End-to-End Radio Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the possible hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder architectures for end-to-end radio communication against noisy channel conditions using standard encoded radio signals. The hybrid scenarios include single-sided, i.e., quantum encoder (transmitter) or quantum decoder (receiver), as well as fully quantum channel autoencoder (transmitter-receiver) systems. We provide detailed formulas for each scenario and validate our model through an extensive set of simulations. Our results demonstrate model robustness and adaptability. Supporting experiments are conducted utilizing 4-QAM and 16-QAM schemes and we expect that the model is adaptable to more general encoding schemes. We explore model performance against both additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading models. Our findings highlight the importance of designing efficient quantum neural network architectures for meeting application performance constraints -- including data re-uploading methods, encoding schemes, and core layer structures. By offering a general framework, this work paves the way for further exploration and development of quantum machine learning applications in radio communication.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling at room temperature with a centimeter-scale quartz crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin-based optomechanical systems with high-frequency acoustic modes provide a promising platform for implementing quantum-information processing and wavelength conversion applications, and for probing macroscopic quantum effects. Achieving strong coupling through electrostrictive Brillouin interaction is essential for coupling the massive mechanical mode to an optical field, thereby controlling and characterizing the mechanical state. However, achieving strong coupling at room temperature has proven challenging due to fast mechanical decay rates, which increase the pumping power required to surpass the coupling threshold. Here, we report an optomechanical system with independent control over pumping power and frequency detuning to achieve and characterize the strong-coupling regime of a bulk acoustic-wave resonator. Through spectral analysis of the cavity reflectivity, we identify clear signatures of strong coupling, i.e., normal-mode splitting and an avoided crossing in the detuned spectra, while estimating the mechanical linewidth $\Gamma_m/2\pi~=~7.13MHz$ and the single-photon coupling rate $g_0/2\pi~=~7.76Hz$ of our system. Our results provide valuable insights into the performances of room-temperature macroscopic mechanical systems and their applications in hybrid quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Simon algorithm in measurement-based quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simon's hidden subgroup algorithm was the first quantum algorithm to prove the superiority of quantum computing over classical computing in terms of complexity. Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a formulation of quantum computing that, while equivalent in terms of computational power, can be advantageous in experiments and in displaying the core mechanics of quantum algorithms. We present a reformulation of the Simon algorithm into the language of MBQC -- in detail for two qubits and schematically for $n$ qubits. We utilize the framework of ZX-calculus, a graphical tensor description of quantum states and operators, to translate the circuit description of the algorithm into a form concordant with MBQC. The result for the two-qubit Simon algorithm is a ten-qubit cluster state on which single-qubit measurements suffice to extract the desired information. Additionally, we show that the $n$-qubit version of the Simon algorithm can be formulated in MBQC as cluster state graph with $2n$ nodes and $n^2$ edges. This is an example of the MBQC formulation of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than its classical counterpart. As such, this formulation should aid in understanding the core mechanics of such an established algorithm and could serve as a blueprint for experimental implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oscillator bases expansion stands as an efficient approximation method for the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation. The method, originally formulated with one non-linear variational parameter, can be extended to incorporate two such parameters. It handles both non- and semi-relativistic kinematics with generic two-body interactions. In the current work, focusing on systems of three identical bodies, the method is generalised to include the management of a given class of three-body forces. The computational cost of this generalisation proves to not exceed the one for two-body interactions. The accuracy of the generalisation is assessed by comparing with results from Lagrange mesh method and hyperspherical harmonic expansions. Extensions for systems of $N$ identical bodies and for systems of two identical particles and one distinct are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the nature of many-body localization transitions (MBLTs) and their potential critical behaviors has remained a challenging problem. In this work, we study the dynamics of the displacement, quantifying the spread of the radial probability distribution in the Fock space, for systems with MBLTs, and perform a finite-size scaling analysis. We find that the scaling exponents satisfy theoretical bounds, and can identify universality classes. We show that reliable extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit for the MBLT induced by quasiperiodic fields is possible even for computationally accessible system sizes. Our work highlights that the displacement is a valuable tool for studying MBLTs, as relevant to ongoing experimental efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning, as an extension of classical machine learning that harnesses quantum mechanics, facilitates effiient learning from data encoded in quantum states. Training a quantum neural network typically demands a substantial labeled training set for supervised learning. Human annotators, often experts, provide labels for samples through additional experiments, adding to the training cost. To mitigate this expense, there is a quest for methods that maintain model performance over fully labeled datasets while requiring fewer labeled samples in practice, thereby extending few-shot learning to the quantum realm. Quantum active learning estimates the uncertainty of quantum data to select the most informative samples from a pool for labeling. Consequently, a QML model is supposed to accumulate maximal knowledge as the training set comprises labeled samples selected via sampling strategies. Notably, the QML models trained within the QAL framework are not restricted to specific types, enabling performance enhancement from the model architecture's perspective towards few-shot learning. Recognizing symmetry as a fundamental concept in physics ubiquitous across various domains, we leverage the symmetry inherent in quantum states induced by the embedding of classical data for model design. We employ an equivariant QNN capable of generalizing from fewer data with geometric priors. We benchmark the performance of QAL on two classification problems, observing both positive and negative results. QAL effectively trains the model, achieving performance comparable to that on fully labeled datasets by labeling less than 7\% of the samples in the pool with unbiased sampling behavior. Furthermore, we elucidate the negative result of QAL being overtaken by random sampling baseline through miscellaneous numerical experiments. (character count limit, see the main text)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of two-way quantum repeater chains with sequential entanglement swapping. Within the analysis we consider memory decoherence, gate imperfections, and imperfect link-level entanglement generation. Our main results include closed-form expressions for the average entanglement fidelity of the generated end-to-end entangled states. We generalize previous findings for the one-shot fidelity analysis and study the case where repeater chains serve end-to-end requests continuously. We provide solutions to the continuous request scenario by combining results from quantum information theory and queuing theory. Finally, we apply the formulas obtained to analyze the impacts of hardware parameters, i.e., coherence times and gate fidelity, and distance on the entanglement fidelity and secret key rate of homogeneous quantum repeater chains.</description>

      <title>The Round Complexity of Proofs in the Bounded Quantum Storage Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The round complexity of interactive proof systems is a key question of practical and theoretical relevance in complexity theory and cryptography. Moreover, results such as QIP = QIP(3) (STOC'00) show that quantum resources significantly help in such a task.
  In this work, we initiate the study of round compression of protocols in the bounded quantum storage model (BQSM). In this model, the malicious parties have a bounded quantum memory and they cannot store the all the qubits that are transmitted in the protocol.
  Our main results in this setting are the following:
  1. There is a non-interactive (statistical) witness indistinguishable proof for any language in NP (and even QMA) in BQSM in the plain model. We notice that in this protocol, only the memory of the verifier is bounded.
  2. Any classical proof system can be compressed in a two-message quantum proof system in BQSM. Moreover, if the original proof system is zero-knowledge, the quantum protocol is zero-knowledge too. In this result, we assume that the prover has bounded memory.
  Finally, we give evidence towards the "tightness" of our results. First, we show that NIZK in the plain model against BQS adversaries is unlikely with standard techniques. Second, we prove that without the BQS model there is no 2-message zero-knowledge quantum interactive proof, even under computational assumptions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating radiation impact on transmon qubits in above and underground facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits can be sensitive to abrupt energy deposits caused by cosmic rays and ambient radioactivity. Previous studies have focused on understanding possible correlated effects over time and distance due to cosmic rays. In this study, for the first time, we directly compare the response of a transmon qubit measured initially at the Fermilab SQMS above-ground facilities and then at the deep underground Gran Sasso Laboratory (INFN-LNGS, Italy). We observe same average qubit lifetime T$_1$ of roughly 80 microseconds at above and underground facilities. We then apply a fast decay detection protocol and investigate the time structure, sensitivity and relative rates of triggered events due to radiation versus intrinsic noise, comparing above and underground performance of several high-coherence qubits. Using gamma sources of variable activity we calibrate the response of the qubit to different levels of radiation in an environment with minimal background radiation. Results indicate that qubits respond to a strong gamma source and it is possible to detect particle impacts. However, when comparing above and underground results, we do not observe a difference in radiation induced-like events for these sapphire and niobium-based transmon qubits. We conclude that the majority of these events are not radiation related and to be attributed to other noise sources which by far dominate single qubit errors in modern transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Computational Characterization of Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a challenging problem to correctly characterize the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. As the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) utilizes non-trivial edge states of the SPT phases as the logical qubit, its computational power is closely tied to the non-trivial topological nature of the phases. In this paper, we propose to use the gate fidelity which is a measure of the computational power of the MBQC to identify the SPT phases in mixed-state settings. Specifically, we investigate the robustness of the Haldane phase by considering the MBQC on the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state subject to different types of noises. To illustrate how our criterion works, we analytically and numerically calculated the gate fidelity to find that its behavior depends crucially on whether the noises satisfy a certain symmetry condition with respect to the on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. In particular, the fidelity for the identity gate, which is given by the sum of the non-local string order parameters, plays an important role. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a stronger symmetry conditions are required to be able to perform other (e.g., the $Z$-rotation gate) gates with high fidelity. By examining which unitary gates can be implemented with the MBQC on the decohered states, we can gain a useful insight into the richer structure of noisy SPT states that cannot be captured solely by the string order parameters.</description>

As we enter the era where quantum computers have hundreds of qubits, we are faced with scalability issues using optimal approaches and degrading heuristic methods' performance due to the lack of global optimization. To this end, we introduce a hybrid design that obtains the much improved solution for the heuristic method utilizing the multilevel framework, which is an effective methodology to solve large-scale problems in VLSI design. In this paper, we present ML-QLS, the first multilevel quantum layout tool with a scalable refinement operation integrated with novel cost functions and clustering strategies. Our clustering provides valuable insights into generating a proper problem approximation for quantum circuits and devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that ML-QLS can scale up to problems involving hundreds of qubits and achieve a remarkable 52% performance improvement over leading heuristic QLS tools for large circuits, which underscores the effectiveness of multilevel frameworks in quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum multiparameter estimation with optimal local measurements</title>

Abstract: We study the multiparameter sensitivity bounds of a sensor made by an array of $d$ spatially-distributed Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). A generic single non-classical state is mixed with $d-1$ vacuums to create a $d$-modes entangled state, each mode entering one input port of a MZI, while a coherent state enters its second port. We show that local measurements, independently performed on each MZI, are sufficient to provide a sensitivity saturating the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. The sensor can overcome the shot noise limit for the estimation of arbitrary linear combinations of the $d$ phase shifts, provided that the non-classical probe state has an anti-squeezed quadrature variance. We compare the sensitivity bounds of this sensor with that achievable with $d$ independent MZIs, each probed with a nonclassical state and a coherent state. We find that the $d$ independent interferometers can achieve the same sensitivity of the entangled protocol but at the cost of using additional $d$ non-classical states rather than a single one. When using in the two protocols the same average number of particles per shot $\bar{n}_T$, we find analytically a sensitivity scaling $1/\bar{n}_T^2$ for the entangled case which provides a gain factor $d$ with respect to the separable case where the sensitivity scales as $d/\bar{n}_T^2$. We have numerical evidences that the gain factor $d$ is also obtained when fixing the total average number of particles, namely when optimizing with respect to the number of repeated measurements.</description>

      <title>Consistency and Causality of Interconnected Nonsignaling Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines networks of $n$ measuring parties sharing $m$ independent nonsignaling resources that can be locally wired together: that is, each party follows a scheme to measure the resources in a cascaded fashion with inputs to later resources possibly depending on outputs of earlier-measured ones. A specific framework is provided for studying probability distributions arising in such networks, and this framework is used to directly prove some accepted, but often only implicitly invoked, facts: there is a uniquely determined and well-defined joint probability distribution for the outputs of all resources shared by the parties, and this joint distribution is nonsignaling. It is furthermore shown that is often sufficient to restrict consideration to only extremal nonsignaling resources when considering features and properties of such networks. Finally, the framework illustrates how the physical theory of nonsignaling boxes and local wirings is causal, supporting the applicability of the inflation technique to constrain such models.
  For an application, we probe the example of (3,2,2) inequalities that witness genuine three-party nonlocality according to the local-operations-shared-randomness definition, and show how all other examples can be derived from that of Mao et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129:150401 (2022)]</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical generation of randomness in Brownian systems as a function of the degree of locality of the Hamiltonian. We first express the trace distance to a unitary design for these systems in terms of an effective equilibrium thermal partition function, and provide a set of conditions that guarantee a linear time to design. We relate the trace distance to design to spectral properties of the time-evolution operator. We apply these considerations to the Brownian $p$-SYK model as a function of the degree of locality $p$. We show that the time to design is linear, with a slope proportional to $1/p$. We corroborate that when $p$ is of order the system size this reproduces the behavior of a completely non-local Brownian model of random matrices. For the random matrix model, we reinterpret these results from the point of view of classical Brownian motion in the unitary manifold. Therefore, we find that the generation of randomness typically persists for exponentially long times in the system size, even for systems governed by highly non-local time-dependent Hamiltonians. We conjecture this to be a general property: there is no efficient way to generate approximate Haar random unitaries dynamically, unless a large degree of fine-tuning is present in the ensemble of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We contrast the slow generation of randomness to the growth of quantum complexity of the time-evolution operator. Using known bounds on circuit complexity for unitary designs, we obtain a lower bound determining that complexity grows at least linearly in time for Brownian systems. We argue that these bounds on circuit complexity are far from tight and that complexity grows at a much faster rate, at least for non-local systems.</description>

      <title>Attosecond spectroscopy using vacuum-ultraviolet pulses emitted from laser-driven semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly laser-driven semiconductor crystals offer substantial advantages for the study of many-body physics and ultrafast optoelectronics via the high harmonic generation process. While this phenomenon has been employed to investigate the dynamics of solids in the presence of strong laser fields, its potential to be utilized as an attosecond light source has remained unexploited. Here, we demonstrate that the high harmonics generated through the interaction of mid--infrared pulses with a ZnO crystal leads to the production of attosecond pulses, that can be used to trace the ultrafast ionization dynamics of alkali metals. In a cross--correlation approach, we photoionize Cesium atoms with the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) high-harmonics in the presence of a mid-infrared laser field. We observe strong oscillations of the photoelectron yield originating from the instantaneous polarization of the atoms by the laser field. The phase of the oscillations encodes the attosecond synchronization of the ionizing high-harmonics and is used for attosecond pulse metrology. This light source opens a new spectral window for attosecond spectroscopy, paving the way for studies of systems with low ionization potentials including neutral atoms, molecules and solids. Additionally, our results highlight the significance of the source for generating non--classical massively entangled light states in the visible--VUV spectral region.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Lifshitz Fermion Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the static entanglement structure in (1+1)-dimensional free Dirac-fermion theory with Lifshitz symmetry and arbitrary integer dynamical critical exponent. This model is different from the one introduced in [Hartmann et al., SciPost Phys. 11, no.2, 031 (2021)] due to a proper treatment of the square Laplace operator. Dirac fermion Lifshitz theory is local as opposed to its scalar counterpart which strongly affects its entanglement structure. We show that there is quantum entanglement across arbitrary subregions in various pure (including the vacuum) and mixed states of this theory for arbitrary integer values of the dynamical critical exponent. Our numerical investigations show that quantum entanglement in this theory is tightly bounded from above. Such a bound and other physical properties of quantum entanglement are carefully explained from the correlation structure in these theories. A generalization to (2+1)-dimensions where the entanglement structure is seriously different is addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from quantum subsystem codes, a more comprehensive class of quantum error-correcting codes than quantum stabilizer codes, for qudit systems of prime dimensions. The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, enabling us to perform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>On Bounded Advice Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advice classes in computational complexity have frequently been used to model real-world scenarios encountered in cryptography, quantum computing and machine learning, where some computational task may be broken down into a preprocessing and deployment phase, each associated with a different complexity. However, in these scenarios, the advice given by the preprocessing phase must still be generated by some (albeit more powerful) bounded machine, which is not the case in conventional advice classes. To better model these cases we develop `bounded advice classes', where a more powerful Turing machine generates advice for another, less powerful, Turing machine. We then focus on the question of when various classes generate useful advice, to answer this we connect bounded advice to unary languages. This connection allows us to state various conditional and unconditional results on the utility of advice generated by $\mathsf{EXP}$, $\mathsf{NP}$, $\mathsf{BQP}$, $\mathsf{PSPACE}$, and more. We study the relations between bounded advice classes, quantum bounded advice classes, and randomised bounded advice. We also examine how each of these concepts interact with recently introduced classes, like $\mathsf{BPP/samp}$. Our results also improve the state of the art in existing research on the complexity of advice functions.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phase and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu$ = 1/2 filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta $M$ and $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF($M$) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class and more exotic beyond-Landau ones. Our work thence presents a direct numerical evidence of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topological ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Signatures of gravitational wave memory in the radiative process of entangled quantum probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we examine entangled quantum probes in geodesic trajectories in a background with gravitational wave (GW) burst. In particular, these quantum probes are prepared initially either in the symmetric or anti-symmetric Bell's states and we study the radiative process as the GW burst passes. Our considered GW burst backgrounds have the profiles of -- Heaviside-theta, $tanh$, Gaussian, and $sech$-squared functions respectively. The first two burst profiles have an asymmetric nature and thus result in non-zero gravitational wave memory. Whereas, for the last two symmetric profiles there is no asymptotic memory. For eternal switching, our observations suggest that the collective transition rate for the entangled probes due to symmetric GW bursts remains the same as obtained in the flat space. Whereas, for asymmetric bursts with memory, there is a finite change, indicating a direct possibility to distinguish between the two above-mentioned scenarios. We also consider finite switching in terms of Gaussian functions and observe characteristic differences in the radiative process between the GW backgrounds with and without memory. Notably, if the Gaussian switching is peaked much later compared to the passing of GW, only memory profiles contribute to the radiative process. We further discuss the physical implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>RealTimeTransport: An open-source C++ library for quantum transport simulations in the strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of quantum transport in the strong system-reservoir coupling regime poses a significant theoretical and computational challenge that demands specialized tools for accurate analysis. RealTimeTransport is a new open-source C++ library that enables the computation of both stationary and transient transport observables for generic quantum systems connected to metallic reservoirs. It computes the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernels for both dynamics and transport in real-time going beyond traditional expansions in the bare system-reservoir couplings. Currently, several methods are available: (i) A renormalized perturbation theory in leading and next-to-leading order which avoids the low-temperature breakdown that limits the traditional theory. (ii) Starting from this well-behaved reference solution a 2- and 3-loop self-consistent renormalization-group transformation of the memory kernels is implemented. This allows refined quantitative predictions even in the presence of many body resonances, such as the Kondo enhancement of cotunneling. This paper provides an overview of the theory, the architecture of RealTimeTransport and practical demonstrations of the currently implemented methods. In particular, we analyze the stationary transport through a serial double quantum dot and showcase for the $T=0$ interacting Anderson model the complete time-development of single-electron tunneling (SET), cotunneling-assisted SET (CO-SET) and inelastic cotunneling resonances throughout the entire gate-bias stability diagram. We discuss the range of applicability of the implemented methods and benchmark them against other advanced approaches.</description>

      <title>A physics-inspired evolutionary machine learning method: from the Schr\"odinger equation to an orbital-free-DFT kinetic energy functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning (ML) supervised model function that is inspired by the variational principle of physics. This ML hypothesis evolutionary method, termed ML-Omega, allows us to go from data to differential equation(s) underlying the physical (chemical, engineering, etc.) phenomena the data are derived from. The fundamental equations of physics can be derived from this ML-Omega evolutionary method when provided the proper training data. By training the ML-Omega model function with only three hydrogen-like atom energies, the method can find Schr\"odinger's exact functional and, from it, Schr\"odinger's fundamental equation. Then, in the field of density functional theory (DFT), when the model function is trained with the energies from the known Thomas-Fermi (TF) formula E = -0.7687Z^7/3, it correctly finds the exact TF functional. Finally, the method is applied to find a local orbital-free (OF) functional expression of the independent electron kinetic energy functional Ts based on the gamma-TF-lambda-vW model. By considering the theoretical energies of only 5 atoms (He, Be, Ne, Mg, Ar) as the training set, the evolutionary ML-Omega method finds an ML-Omega-OF-DFT local Ts functional (gamma-TF-lambda-vW (0.964, 1/4)) that outperforms all the OF- DFT functionals of a representative group. Moreover, our ML-Omega-OF functional overcomes the LDA's and some local GGA-DFT's functionals' difficulty to describe the stretched bond region at the correct spin configuration of diatomic molecules. Although our evolutionary ML-Omega model function can work without an explicit prior-form functional, by using the techniques of symbolic regression, in this work we exploit prior-form functional expressions to make the training process faster in the example problems presented here.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian quantum walks and non-Markovianity: the coin-position interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.10682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken regime can lead to unitary dynamics under the appropriate choice of the Hilbert space. The Hilbert space is determined by a Hamiltonian-compatible inner product map on the underlying vector space, facilitated by a ``metric operator". A more traditional method, however, involves treating the evolution as open system dynamics, and the state is constructed through normalization at each time step. In this work, we present a comparative study of the two methods of constructing the reduced dynamics of a system evolving under a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian. Our system is a one-dimensional quantum walk with the spin and position degrees of freedom forming its two subsystems. We compare the information flow between the subsystems under the two methods. We find that under the metric formalism, a power law decay of the information backflow to the subsystem gives a clear indication of the transition from $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken to the broken phase. This is unlike the information backflow under the normalized state method. We also note that even though non-Hermiticity models open system dynamics, pseudo-Hermiticity can increase entanglement between the subsystem in the metric Hilbert space, thus indicating that pseudo-Hermiticity cases can be seen as a resource in quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Frequency instabilities are a major source of errors in quantum devices. This study investigates frequency fluctuations in a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator, where reflection coefficients of 14 SAW modes are measured simultaneously for more than seven hours. We report two distinct noise characteristics. Multimode frequency noise caused by interactions with two-level system (TLS) defects shows significant degrees of correlations that diminish with increased detuning. This finding agrees with the current understanding of the parasitic TLS behavior as one of the dominant noise sources in quantum devices. In addition to the TLS-induced noise, we observe strong anomalous frequency fluctuations with slow, anti-correlated dynamics. These noise bursts resemble signatures of cosmic radiation observed in superconducting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Operational Interpretation of the Sandwiched R\'enyi Divergence of Order 1/2 to 1 as Strong Converse Exponents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00554v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, as well as its induced quantum information quantities, with an operational interpretation in the characterization of the exact strong converse exponents of quantum tasks. Specifically, we consider (a) smoothing of the max-relative entropy, (b) quantum privacy amplification, and (c) quantum information decoupling. We solve the problem of determining the exact strong converse exponents for these three tasks, with the performance being measured by the fidelity or purified distance. The results are given in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, and its induced quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy and quantum R\'enyi mutual information. This is the first time to find the precise operational meaning for the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence with R\'enyi parameter in the interval $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$.</description>

Abstract: With increased power consumption of modern computer components, heat-based circuitry has become ever more relevant due to a lower power expense to process logic bits of information. In heat-based circuits, computations are performed by driving heat currents through a circuit using a temperature difference. Utilizing harmonic oscillators and three-level quantum rectifiers as base components, we study three different heat-based circuits: a series configuration of diodes, a parallel configuration of diodes, and a diode bridge rectifier. We demonstrate the required functionality of each circuit for use as heat-based analogues of standard electronic components. Furthermore, the diode bridge rectifier is found to give consistent sign of the output bias independent of the input bias thus rectifying the input. Our results prove the theoretical feasibility of combining heat current components into heat-based circuits. The three circuits should be realizable using several of the current quantum technology platforms.</description>

      <title>Optimizing one-axis twists for variational Bayesian quantum metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metrology and sensing seek advantage in estimating an unknown parameter of some quantum state or channel, using entanglement such as spin squeezing produced by one-axis twists or other quantum resources. In particular, qubit phase estimation, or rotation sensing, appears as a ubiquitous problem with applications to electric field sensing, magnetometry, atomic clocks, and gyroscopes. By adopting the Bayesian formalism to the phase estimation problem to account for limited initial knowledge about the value of the phase, we formulate variational metrology and treat the state preparation (or encoding) and measurement (or decoding) procedures as parameterized quantum circuits. It is important to understand how effective various parametrized protocols are as well as how robust they are to the effects of complex noise such as spatially correlated noise. First, we propose a new family of parametrized encoding and decoding protocols called arbitrary-axis twist ansatzes, and show that it can lead to a substantial reduction in the number of one-axis twists needed to achieve a target estimation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimation error associated with these strategies decreases with system size in a faster manner than classical (or no-twists) protocols, even in the less-explored regimes where the prior information is limited. Last, using a polynomial-size tensor network algorithm, we numerically analyze practical variational metrology beyond the symmetric subspace of a collective spin, and find that quantum advantage persists for the arbitrary-axis twist ansatzes with a few one-axis twists and smaller total twisting angles for practically relevant noise levels.</description>

      <title>Fidelity-Based Smooth Min-Relative Entropy: Properties and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy is a distinguishability measure that has appeared in a variety of contexts in prior work on quantum information, including resource theories like thermodynamics and coherence. Here we provide a comprehensive study of this quantity. First we prove that it satisfies several basic properties, including the data-processing inequality. We also establish connections between the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy and other widely used information-theoretic quantities, including smooth min-relative entropy and smooth sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy, of which the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and smooth max-relative entropy are special cases. After that, we use these connections to establish the second-order asymptotics of the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy and all smooth sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropies, finding that the first-order term is the quantum relative entropy and the second-order term involves the quantum relative entropy variance. Utilizing the properties derived, we also show how the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy provides one-shot bounds for operational tasks in general resource theories in which the target state is mixed, with a particular example being randomness distillation. The above observations then lead to second-order expansions of the upper bounds on distillable randomness, as well as the precise second-order asymptotics of the distillable randomness of particular classical-quantum states. Finally, we establish semi-definite programs for smooth max-relative entropy and smooth conditional min-entropy, as well as a bilinear program for the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy, which we subsequently use to explore the tightness of a bound relating the last to the first.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complementarity plays a pivotal role in understanding a diverse range of quantum phenomena. Here, we show how the tradeoff between quantities of a complete complementarity relation is modified in an arbitrary spacetime for a particle with an internal spin. This effect stems from local Wigner rotations in the spacetime, which couple the spin to the system's external degrees of freedom. To conduct our study, we utilize two generalized delayed-choice interferometers. Despite differences in complementarity tradeoffs inside the interferometers, the interferometric visibility of both setups coincides in any relativistic regime. Our results extend the finding that general relativity induces a universal decoherence effect on quantum superpositions, as local Wigner rotations, being purely kinematical, preclude any spin dynamics. To illustrate, we analyze the Newtonian limit of our results.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pufferfish Privacy: A Flexible Privacy Framework for Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a versatile privacy framework for quantum systems, termed quantum pufferfish privacy (QPP). Inspired by classical pufferfish privacy, our formulation generalizes and addresses limitations of quantum differential privacy by offering flexibility in specifying private information, feasible measurements, and domain knowledge. We show that QPP can be equivalently formulated in terms of the Datta-Leditzky information spectrum divergence, thus providing the first operational interpretation thereof. We reformulate this divergence as a semi-definite program and derive several properties of it, which are then used to prove convexity, composability, and post-processing of QPP mechanisms. Parameters that guarantee QPP of the depolarization mechanism are also derived. We analyze the privacy-utility tradeoff of general QPP mechanisms and, again, study the depolarization mechanism as an explicit instance. The QPP framework is then applied to privacy auditing for identifying privacy violations via a hypothesis testing pipeline that leverages quantum algorithms. Connections to quantum fairness and other quantum divergences are also explored and several variants of QPP are examined.</description>

      <title>Practical limitations on robustness and scalability of quantum Internet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum theory allows for information processing and computing tasks that otherwise are not possible with classical systems, there is a need and use of quantum Internet beyond existing network systems. At the same time, the realization of a desirably functional quantum Internet is hindered by fundamental and practical challenges such as high loss during transmission of quantum systems, decoherence due to interaction with the environment, fragility of quantum states, etc. We study the implications of these constraints by analyzing the limitations on the scaling and robustness of quantum Internet. Considering quantum networks, we present practical bottlenecks for secure communication, delegated computing, and resource distribution among end nodes. Motivated by the power of abstraction in graph theory (in association with quantum information theory), we consider graph-theoretic quantifiers to assess network robustness and provide critical values of communication lines for viable communication over quantum Internet.
  In particular, we begin by discussing limitations on usefulness of isotropic states as device-independent quantum key repeaters which otherwise could be useful for device-independent quantum key distribution. We consider some quantum networks of practical interest, ranging from satellite-based networks connecting far-off spatial locations to currently available quantum processor architectures within computers, and analyze their robustness to perform quantum information processing tasks. Some of these tasks form primitives for delegated quantum computing, e.g., entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation. For some examples of quantum networks, we present algorithms to perform different quantum network tasks of interest such as constructing the network structure, finding the shortest path between a pair of end nodes, and optimizing the flow of resources at a node.</description>

      <title>Pseudomagic Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Notions of nonstabilizerness, or "magic", quantify how non-classical quantum states are in a precise sense: states exhibiting low nonstabilizerness preclude quantum advantage. We introduce 'pseudomagic' ensembles of quantum states that, despite low nonstabilizerness, are computationally indistinguishable from those with high nonstabilizerness. Previously, such computational indistinguishability has been studied with respect to entanglement, introducing the concept of pseudoentanglement. However, we demonstrate that pseudomagic neither follows from pseudoentanglement nor implies it. In terms of applications, the study of pseudomagic offers fresh insights into the theory of quantum scrambling: it uncovers states that, even though they originate from non-scrambling unitaries, remain indistinguishable from scrambled states to any physical observer. Additional applications include new lower bounds on state synthesis problems, property testing protocols, and implications for quantum cryptography. Our work is driven by the observation that only quantities measurable by a computationally bounded observer - intrinsically limited by finite-time computational constraints - hold physical significance. Ultimately, our findings suggest that nonstabilizerness is a 'hide-able' characteristic of quantum states: some states are much more magical than is apparent to a computationally bounded observer.</description>

      <title>Detecting Measurement-Induced Entanglement Transitions With Unitary Mirror Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitored random circuits, consisting of alternating layers of entangling two-qubit gates and projective single-qubit measurements applied to some fraction $p$ of the qubits, have been a topic of recent interest. In particular, the resulting steady state exhibits a phase transition from highly correlated states with "volume-law" entanglement at $p&lt;p_{c}$ to localized states with "area-law" entanglement at $p&gt;p_{c}$. It is hard to access this transition experimentally, as it cannot be seen at the ensemble level. Naively, to observe it one must repeat the experiment until the set of measurement results repeats itself, with likelihood that is exponentially small in the number of measurements. To overcome this issue, we present a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm which creates a matrix product state (MPS) based "unitary mirror" of the projected circuit. Polynomial-sized tensor networks can represent quantum states with area-law entanglement, and so the unitary mirror can well-approximate the experimental state above $p_{c}$ but fails exponentially below it. The breaking of this mirror can thus pinpoint the critical point. We outline the algorithm and how such results would be obtained. We present a bound on the maximum entanglement entropy of any given state that is well-represented by an MPS, and from the bound suggest how the volume-law phase can be bounded. We consider whether the entanglement could similarly be bounded from below where the MPS fails. Finally, we present numerical results for small qubit numbers and for monitored circuits with random Clifford gates.</description>

Abstract: The state of the art of quantum circuits using the ripple-carry strategy for the addition and comparison of two n-bit numbers is presented, as well as optimizations in the Clifford+T gate set, both in terms of CNOT-depth and T-depth, or CNOT-count and T-count. In particular, we consider the adders presented by Cuccaro et al. and Takahashi et al., and exhibit an adder with a T-depth of 3n and a CNOT-depth of 8n, while without optimization of the original circuits, a T-depth of 6n is expected. Note that we have focused here on quantum ripple-carry adders using at most one ancilla, without any approximation of the 3-qubit gates involved (Toffoli, Peres and TR) or any strategy involving a measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The rates of transitions between states of the system, that characterize the process, are found by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Further, we search for time dependence of mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that under made assumptions it is governed by Boltzmann collision integral. In this theory, the non-coherence is the mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution. Thus we present the possible solution for the famous time-arrow problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an extended numerical search for practical fermion-to-qubit encodings with error correcting properties. Ideally, encodings should strike a balance between a number of the seemingly incompatible attributes, such as having a high minimum distance, low-weight fermionic logical operators, a small qubit to fermionic mode ratio and a simple qubit connectivity graph including ancilla qubits for the measurement of stabilizers. Our strategy consists of a three-step procedure in which we: first generate encodings with code distances up to $d\leq4$ by a brute-force enumeration technique; subsequently, we use these encodings as starting points and apply Clifford deformations to them which allows us to identify higher-distance codes with $d\leq7$; finally, we optimize the hardware connectivity graphs of resulting encodings in terms of the graph thickness and the number of connections per qubit. We report multiple promising high-distance encodings which significantly improve the weights of stabilizers and logical operators compared to previously reported alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual information defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. We prove that these measures decay superexponentially at every positive temperature, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network approximations in terms of marginals of small (sublogarithmic) size. As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. The results extend from strictly local to exponentially-decaying interactions above a threshold temperature, albeit only with exponential decay rates. As a technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate both ordered and chaotic Bohmian trajectories within the Born distribution of Bohmian particles of an anisotropic 2d quantum harmonic oscillator. We compute the average values of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and position using both Standard Quantum Mechanics and Bohmian Mechanics. In particular, we examine realizations of the Born distribution for a wavefunction with a single nodal point and two different wavefunctions with multiple nodal points: one with an almost equal number of ordered and chaotic trajectories, and another composed primarily of chaotic trajectories. Throughout our analysis, we focus on elucidating the contribution of ordered and chaotic Bohmian trajectories in determining these average values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for quantum many-body simulations called the operator learning renormalization group (OLRG). Inspired by machine learning perspectives, OLRG is a generalization of Wilson's numerical renormalization group and White's density matrix renormalization group, which recursively builds a simulatable system to approximate a target system of the same number of sites via operator maps. OLRG uses a loss function to minimize the error of a target property directly by learning the operator map in lieu of a state ansatz. This loss function is designed by a scaling consistency condition that also provides a provable bound for real-time evolution. We implement two versions of the operator maps for classical and quantum simulations. The former, which we call the Operator Matrix Map, can be implemented via neural networks on classical computers. The latter, which we call the Hamiltonian Expression Map, generates device pulse sequences to leverage the capabilities of quantum computing hardware. We illustrate the performance of both maps for calculating time-dependent quantities in the quantum Ising model Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that injecting a light pulse prepared in the Shroedinger cat quantum state into the dark port of a two-arm interferometer and the strong classical light into the bright one, it is possible, in principle, to detect a given phase shift unambiguously. The value of this phase shift is inversely proportional to the amplitudes of both the classical carrier and Shroedinger cat state. However, an exotic detection procedure is required for this purpose. By measuring the number of photons at the output dark port, it is possible to detect the phase shift with the vanishing "false positive" probability. The "false negative" probability in this case decreases with the increase on the amplitude of the Schroedinger cat state and, for reasonable values of this amplitude, can be made as small as about 0.1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classically defined minimum uncertainty of the optical phase is known as the standard quantum limit or shot-noise limit (SNL) originating in the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Based on SNL, the phase sensitivity is inversely proportional to the square root K, where K is the number of interfering photons or statistically measured events. Thus, using a high-power laser is advantageous to enhance sensitivity due to the square root K gain in the signal-to-noise ratio. In a typical interferometer, however, the resolution remains in the diffraction limit of the K=1 case unless the interfering photons are resolved as in quantum sensing. Here, a projection-measurement method in quantum sensing is adapted for an interferometer to achieve an additional square root K gain in resolution. For the projection measurement, the interference fringe of an interferometer can be Kth-powered to replace the Kth-order intensity product. To understand many-wave interference-caused enhanced resolution, several types of interferometers are numerically compared to draw corresponding resolution parameters. As a result, the achieved resolution by the Kth power to an N-slit interferometer exceeds the diffraction limit and the Heisenberg limit in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>QOSST: A Highly-Modular Open Source Platform for Experimental Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables secret key exchange between two remote parties with information-theoretic security rooted in the laws of quantum physics. Encoding key information in continuous variables (CV), such as the values of quadrature components of coherent states of light, brings implementations much closer to standard optical communication systems, but this comes at the price of significant complexity in the digital signal processing techniques required for operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this work, we wish to lower the barriers to entry for CV-QKD experiments associated to this difficulty by providing a highly modular, open source software that is in principle hardware agnostic and can be used in multiple configurations. We benchmarked this software, called QOSST, using an experimental setup with a locally generated local oscillator, frequency multiplexed pilots and RF-heterodyne detection, and obtained state-of-the-art secret key rates of the order of Mbit/s over metropolitan distances at the asymptotic limit. We hope that QOSST can be used to stimulate further experimental advances in CV-QKD and be improved and extended by the community to achieve high performance in a wide variety of configurations.</description>

      <title>Informationally overcomplete measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Informationally overcomplete measurements find important applications in quantum tomography and quantum state estimation. The most popular are maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for which trace relations between measurement operators are well known. In this paper, we introduce a more general class of informationally overcomplete POVMs that are generated by equiangular tight frames of arbitrary rank. This class provides a generalization of equiangular measurements to non-projective POVMs, which include rescaled mutually unbiased measurements and bases. We provide a method of their construction, analyze their symmetry properties, and provide examples for highly symmetric cases. In particular, we find a wide class of generalized equiangular measurements that are conical 2-designs, which allows us to derive the index of coincidence. Our results show benefits of considering a single informationally overcomplete measurement over informationally complete collections of POVMs.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. classical $P$-divisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $P$-divisibility is a central concept in both classical and quantum non-Markovian processes; in particular, it is strictly related to the notion of information backflow. When restricted to a fixed commutative algebra generated by a complete set of orthogonal projections, any quantum dynamics naturally provides a classical stochastic process. It is indeed well known that a quantum generator gives rise to a $P$-divisible quantum dynamics if and only if all its possible classical reductions give rise to divisible classical stochastic processes. Yet, this property does not hold if one operates a classical reduction of the quantum dynamical maps instead of their generators: as an example, for a unitary dynamics, $P$-divisibility of its classical reduction is inevitably lost, which thus exhibits information backflow. Instead, for some important classes of purely dissipative qubit evolutions, quantum $P$-divisibility always implies classical $P$-divisibility and thus lack of information backflow both in the quantum and classical scenarios. On the contrary, for a wide class of orthogonally covariant qubit dynamics, we show that loss of classical $P$-divisibility can originate from the classical reduction of a purely dissipative $P$-divisible quantum dynamics as in the unitary case. Moreover, such an effect can be interpreted in terms of information backflow, the information coming in being stored in the coherences of the time-evolving quantum state.</description>

      <title>Statistical Qubit Freezing Extending Physical Limit of Quantum Annealers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum annealers encounter scalability challenges due to exponentially fast diminishing energy gaps between ground and excited states with qubit-count increase. This introduces errors in identifying ground states compounded by a thermal noise. We propose a novel algorithmic scheme called statistical qubit freezing (SQF) that selectively fixes the state of statistically deterministic qubit in the annealing Hamiltonian model of the given problem. Applying freezing repeatedly, SQF significantly enhances the spectral gap between of an adiabatic process, as an example, by up to 60\% compared to traditional annealing methods in the standard D-Wave's quantum Ising machine solution, effectively overcoming the fundamental limitations.</description>

Abstract: The formation of Schrodinger cat-like states during the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process (SPDC) is studied when the pump mode is considered quantum and depleted. The Schrodinger cat-like state is formed in the fundamental and second harmonic modes, and the negativity in both modes is studied for certain initial state conditions and interaction lengths. The Wigner function is used to visualize qualitatively Schrodinger cat-like states.</description>

      <title>Circuit Implementation and Analysis of a Quantum-Walk Based Search Complement Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modified version of the quantum walk-based search algorithm created by Shenvi, Kempe and Whaley, also known as the SKW algorithm. In our version of the algorithm, we modified the evolution operator of the system so that it is composed by the product of the shift operator associated to the $2^n$-complete graph with self-loops and a perturbed coin operator based on the Hadamard operator that works as an oracle for the search. The modified evolution operator leads the opposite behavior as in the original algorithm, that is, the probability to measure the target state is reduced. We call this new behavior the $\textit{search complement}$. Taking a multigraph and matrix approach, we were able to explain that the new algorithm decreases the probability of the target state given that there are less paths that lead towards the node that is associated to the target state in a Unitary Coined Discrete-Time Quantum Walk. The search complement algorithm was executed experimentally on IBM quantum processor $\textit{ibmq_manila}$ obtaining statistical distances $\ell_1\leq 0.0895$ when decreasing the probability of one state out of four.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multistability cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a monostable master equation. On the other hand, multistability is experimentally-observed in a variety of quantum systems. A master equation having a nonlinear term that gives rise to disentanglement has been recently proposed . The dynamics governed by this master equation is explored for a quantum system made of coupled spins. It is found that the added nonlinear term can give rise to multistability. The spins' response to an externally applied magnetic field is evaluated, and both a phase transition and a dynamical instability are found. These findings, which originate from disentanglement-induced multistability, indirectly support the hypothesis that spontaneous disentanglement occurs in quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

      <title>Controlling the interactions in a cold atom quantum impurity system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement an experimental architecture in which a single atom of K is trapped in an optical tweezer, and is immersed in a bath of Rb atoms at ultralow temperatures. In this regime, the motion of the single trapped atom is confined to the lowest quantum vibrational levels. This realizes an elementary and fully controllable quantum impurity system. For the trapping of the K atom, we use a species-selective dipole potential, that allows us to independently manipulate the quantum impurity and the bath. We concentrate on the characterization and control of the interactions between the two subsystems. To this end, we perform Feshbach spectroscopy, detecting several inter-dimensional confinement-induced Feshbach resonances for the KRb interspecies scattering length, that parametrizes the strength of the interactions. We compare our data to a theory for inter-dimensional scattering, finding good agreement. Notably, we also detect a series of p-wave resonances stemming from the underlying free-space s-wave interactions. We further determine how the resonances behave as the temperature of the bath and the dimensionality of the interactions change. Additionally, we are able to screen the quantum impurity from the bath by finely tuning the wavelength of the light that produces the optical tweezer, providing us with a new effective tool to control and minimize the interactions. Our results open a range of new possibilities in quantum simulations of quantum impurity models, quantum information, and quantum thermodynamics, where the interactions between a quantized system and the bath is a powerful yet largely underutilized resource.</description>

      <title>Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the entropy of the coherent-state distribution function (Husimi function), and is non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the Wehrl entropy for $N$ spin-1/2 particles with respect to SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states (i.e., the direct products of spin coherent states of each particle). We focus on: (1) The statistical interpretation of this Wehrl entropy. (2) The relationship between the Wehrl entropy and quantum entanglement. For (1), despite the coherent states not forming a group of orthonormal bases, we prove that the Wehrl entropy can still be interpreted as the entropy of a probability distribution with clear physical meaning. For (2), we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various entangled pure states with particle number $2\leq N\leq 20$. Our results show that for the large-$N$ ($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states are much larger than that of the regular ones (e.g., the GHZ state). These results, together with the fact that the Wehrl entropy is invariant under local unitary transformations, indicate that the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement (entanglement complexity) of many-body pure states, as A. Sugita proposed directly from the definitions of the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). Furthermore, the Wehrl entropy per particle can serve as a quantitative description of this complexity. We further show that the many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, according to the behaviors of the Wehrl entropy per particle in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, with the states of each type having very different entanglement complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading of quantum information in a recently introduced family of brickwork quantum circuits that generalises the dual-unitary class. These circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again independent on the R\'enyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these circuits.</description>

We present a quantum imaginary time evolution (ITE) algorithm as a solution to such equations in the case of nuclear Hartree-Fock equations.

Abstract: Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein distances defined by channels, and they are conjectured to be genuine metrics on quantum state spaces by De Palma and Trevisan. We prove triangle inequality for quantum Wasserstein divergences for every quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space and any quadratic cost operator under the assumption that a particular state involved is pure, and all the states have finite energy. We also provide strong numerical evidence suggesting that the triangle inequality holds in general, for an arbitrary choice of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Neural-network Quantum States (NQS) has significantly advanced wave function ansatz research, sparking a resurgence in orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC) exploration. This work introduces three algorithmic enhancements to reduce computational demands of VMC optimization using NQS: an adaptive learning rate algorithm, constrained optimization, and block optimization. We evaluate the refined algorithm on complex multireference bond stretches of $\rm H_2O$ and $\rm N_2$ within the cc-pVDZ basis set and calculate the ground-state energy of the strongly correlated chromium dimer ($\rm Cr_2$) in the Ahlrichs SV basis set. Our results achieve superior accuracy compared to coupled cluster theory at a relatively modest CPU cost. This work demonstrates how to enhance optimization efficiency and robustness using these strategies, opening a new path to optimize large-scale Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-based NQS more effectively and marking a substantial advancement in NQS's practical quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of lattice gauge theories on quantum computers necessitates digitizing gauge fields. One approach involves substituting the continuous gauge group with a discrete subgroup, but the implications of this approximation still need to be clarified. To gain insights, we investigate the subduction of $ SU(2) $ and $ SU(3)$ to discrete crystal-like subgroups. Using classical lattice calculations, we show that subduction offers valuable information based on subduced direct sums, helping us identify additional terms to incorporate into the lattice action that can mitigate the effects of digitization. Furthermore, we compute the static potentials of all irreducible representations of $ \Sigma(360 \times 3) $ at a fixed lattice spacing. Our results reveal a percent-level agreement with the Casimir scaling of ( SU(3) ) for irreducible representations that subduce to a single $ \Sigma(360 \times 3) $ irreducible representation. This provides a diagnostic measure of approximation quality, as some irreducible representations closely match the expected results while others exhibit significant deviations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>
