      <title>Quantum fields on projective geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering homogeneous four-dimensional space-time geometries within real projective geometry provides a mathematically well-defined framework to discuss their deformations and limits without the appearance of coordinate singularities. On Lie algebra level the related conjugacy limits act isomorphically to concatenations of contractions. We axiomatically introduce projective quantum fields on homogeneous space-time geometries, based on correspondingly generalized unitary transformation behavior and projectivization of the field operators. Projective correlators and their expectation values remain well-defined in all geometry limits, which includes their ultraviolet and infrared limits. They can degenerate with support on space-time boundaries and other lower-dimensional space-time subspaces. We explore fermionic and bosonic superselection sectors as well as the irreducibility of projective quantum fields. Dirac fermions appear, which obey spin-statistics as composite quantum fields. The framework might be of use for the consistent description of quantum fields in holographic correspondences and their flat limits.</description>

      <title>The 2D Toda lattice hierarchy for multiplicative functionals of Schur measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Fredholm determinants build out from generalizations of Schur measures, or equivalently, arbitrary multiplicative functionals of the original Schur measures are tau-functions of the 2D Toda lattice hierarchy. Our result apply to finite temperature Schur measures, and extends both the result of Okounkov in \cite{okounkovschurmeasures} and of Cafasso-Ruzza in \cite{cafassoruzza} concerning the finite-temperature Plancherel measure. Our proof lies on the semi-infinite wedge formalism and the Boson-Fermion correspondance.</description>

      <title>Analytical computation of bifurcation of orbits near collinear libration point in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified analytical solution is presented for constructing the phase space near collinear libration points in the Circular Restricted Three-body Problem (CRTBP), encompassing Lissajous orbits and quasihalo orbits, their invariant manifolds, as well as transit and non-transit orbits. Traditional methods could only derive separate analytical solutions for the invariant manifolds of Lissajous orbits and halo orbits, falling short for the invariant manifolds of quasihalo orbits. By introducing a coupling coefficient {\eta} and a bifurcation equation, a unified series solution for these orbits is systematically developed using a coupling-induced bifurcation mechanism and Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. Analyzing the third-order bifurcation equation reveals bifurcation conditions for halo orbits, quasihalo orbits, and their invariant manifolds. Furthermore, new families of periodic orbits similar to halo orbits are discovered, and non-periodic/quasi-periodic orbits, such as transit orbits and non-transit orbits, are found to undergo bifurcations. When {\eta} = 0, the series solution describes Lissajous orbits and their invariant manifolds, transit, and non-transit orbits. As {\eta} varies from zero to non-zero values, the solution seamlessly transitions to describe quasihalo orbits and their invariant manifolds, as well as newly bifurcated transit and non-transit orbits. This unified analytical framework provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex phase space structures near collinear libration points in the CRTBP.</description>

      <title>Construction of Gross-Neveu model using Polchinski flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gross-Neveu model is a quantum field theory model of Dirac fermions in two dimensions with a quartic interaction term. Like Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, the model is renormalizable (but not super-renormalizable) and asymptotically free (i.e. its short-distance behaviour is governed by the free theory). We give a new construction of the massive Euclidean Gross-Neveu model in infinite volume based on the renormalization group flow equation. The construction does not involve cluster expansion or discretization of phase-space. We express the Schwinger functions of the Gross-Neveu model in terms of the effective potential and construct the effective potential by solving the flow equation using the Banach fixed point theorem. Since we use crucially the fact that fermionic fields can be represented as bounded operators our construction does not extend to models including bosons. However, it is applicable to other asymptotically free purely fermionic theories such as the symplectic fermion model.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic singularity in the density four-point function of two-dimensional critical percolation in the bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide definitive proof of the logarithmic nature of the percolation conformal field theory in the bulk by showing that the four-point function of the density operator has a logarithmic divergence as two points collide and that the same divergence appears in the operator product expansion (OPE) of two density operators. The right hand side of the OPE contains two operators with the same scaling dimension, one of them multiplied by a term with a logarithmic singularity. Our method involves a probabilistic analysis of the percolation events contributing to the four-point function. It does not require algebraic considerations, nor taking the $Q \to 1$ limit of the $Q$-state Potts model, and is amenable to a rigorous mathematical formulation. The logarithmic divergence appears as a consequence of scale invariance combined with independence.</description>

      <title>Quantum concentration inequalities and equivalence of the thermodynamical ensembles: an optimal mass transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new concentration inequalities for quantum spin systems which apply to any local observable measured on any product state or on any state with exponentially decaying correlations. Our results do not require the spins to be arranged in a regular lattice, and cover the case of observables that contain terms acting on spins at arbitrary distance. Moreover, we introduce a local W1 distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of two states with respect to local observables. We prove a transportation-cost inequality stating that the local W1 distance between a generic state and a state with exponentially decaying correlations is upper bounded by a function of their relative entropy. Finally, we apply such inequality to prove the equivalence between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics and the weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the Hamiltonians whose Gibbs states have exponentially decaying correlations.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard Lagrangians and branched Hamiltonians: A brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians have found attention in the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The latter, however, assume initial states which are highly concentrated around a specific energy window and, as such, cannot account for a large class of states that are of paramount importance and that are operationally accessible in natural physical settings, including many experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation: low-entanglement states. In this work, we prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, we define a random energy smoothing - motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution - on local Hamiltonians that lead to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under a mild condition, the short time dynamics.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_4$ deformations of celestial symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celestial holography has led to the discovery of new symmetry algebras arising from the study of collinear limits of perturbative gravity amplitudes in flat space. We explain from the twistor perspective how a non-vanishing cosmological constant $\Lambda$ naturally modifies the celestial chiral algebra. The cosmological constant deforms the Poisson bracket on twistor space, so the corresponding deformed algebra of Hamiltonians under the new bracket is automatically consistent. This algebra is equivalent to that recently found by Taylor and Zhu. We find a number of variations of the deformed algebra. We give the Noether charges arising from the expression of this algebra as a symmetry of the twistor action for self-dual gravity with cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Properties and baroclinic instability of stratified thermal upper-ocean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of, and perform a stability analysis of a baroclinic zonal current in, a thermal rotating shallow-water model, sometimes called \emph{Ripa's model}, featuring stratification for quasigeostrophic upper-ocean dynamics. The model has Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. In addition to Casimirs, the model supports integrals of motion that neither form the kernel of the bracket nor are related to explicit symmetries. The model sustains Rossby waves and a neutral model, whose spurious growth is prevented by a positive-definite integral, quadratic on the deviation from the motionless state. A baroclinic zonal jet with vertical curvature is found to be spectrally stable for specific configurations of the gradients of layer thickness, vertically averaged buoyancy, and buoyancy frequency. Only a subset of such states was found Lyapunov stable using the available integrals, except the newly reported ones, whose role in constraining stratified thermal flow remains elusive. The existence of Lyapunov-stable states enabled bounding the nonlinear growth of perturbations to spectrally unstable states. Our results do not support the generality of earlier numerical evidence on the suppression of submesoscale wave activity as a result of the inclusion of stratification in thermal shallow-water theory, which we supported with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Analytic Approach for Computation of Topological Number of Integrable Vortex on Torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytic method to calculate the vortex number on a torus is constructed, focusing on analytic vortex solutions to the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, whose governing equation is the so-called Jackiw-Pi equation. The equation is one of the integrable vortex equations and is reduced to Liouville's equation. The requirement of continuity of the Higgs field strongly restricts the characteristics and the fundamental domain of the vortices. Also considered are the decompactification limits of the vortices on a torus, in which "flux loss" phenomena occasionally occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work examines a special behavior of the magnetic conductivity of metals that arises when chaotic electron trajectories appear on the Fermi surface. This behavior is due to the scattering of electrons at singular points of the dynamic system describing the dynamics of electrons in $\, {\bf p}$-space, and caused by small-angle scattering of electrons on phonons. In this situation, the electronic system is described by a "non-standard" relaxation time, which plays the main role in a certain range of temperature and magnetic field values.</description>

      <title>Kinetic data-driven approach to turbulence subgrid modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows are well known to pose extreme computational challenges due to the huge number of dynamical degrees of freedom required to correctly describe the complex multi-scale statistical correlations of the velocity. On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows, stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here we demonstrate that, by properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach towards subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically we show that by leveraging on data from fully resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data we can learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver (the lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational costs and enhanced generalization capabilities. We show that the model offers superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the Smagorinsky model, being less dissipative and, therefore, being able to more closely capture the intermittency of higher-order velocity correlations.</description>

      <title>Nijenhuis deformations of Poisson algebras and $F$-manifold algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of pre-Poisson algebras was introduced by Aguiar in his study of zinbiel algebras and pre-Lie algebras. In this paper, we first introduce NS-Poisson algebras as a generalization of both Poisson algebras and pre-Poisson algebras. An NS-Poisson algebra has an associated sub-adjacent Poisson algebra. We show that a Nijenhuis operator on a Poisson algebra deforms the structure into an NS-Poisson algebra. The semi-classical limit of an NS-algebra deformation and a suitable filtration of an NS-algebra produce NS-Poisson algebras. On the other hand, $F$-manifold algebras were introduced by Dotsenko as the underlying algebraic structure of $F$-manifolds. We also introduce NS-$F$-manifold algebras as a simultaneous generalization of NS-Poisson algebras, $F$-manifold algebras and pre-$F$-manifold algebras. In the end, we show that Nijenhuis deformations of $F$-manifold algebras and the semi-classical limits of NS-pre-Lie algebra deformations have NS-$F$-manifold algebra structures.</description>

      <title>Numerical optimisation of Dirac eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by relativistic materials, we develop a numerical scheme to support existing or state new conjectures in the spectral optimisation of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator, subject to infinite-mass boundary conditions. We study the optimality of the regular polygon (respectively, disk) among all polygons of a given number of sides (respectively, arbitrary sets), subject to area or perimeter constraints. We consider the three lowest positive eigenvalues and their ratios. Roughly, we find results analogous to known or expected for the Dirichlet Laplacian, except for the third eigenvalue which does not need to be minimised by the regular polygon (respectively, the disk) for all masses. In addition to the numerical results, a new, mass-dependent upper bound to the lowest eigenvalue in rectangles is proved and its extension to arbitrary quadrilaterals is conjectured.</description>

      <title>Classifying symmetric and symmetry-broken spin chain phases with anomalous group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classification problem of quantum spin chains invariant under local decomposable group actions, covering matrix product unitaries (MPUs), using an operator algebraic approach. We focus on finite group symmetries hosting both symmetric and symmetry broken phases. The local-decomposable group actions we consider have a 3-cocycle class of the symmetry group associated to them. We derive invariants for our classification that naturally cover one-dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases. We prove that these invariants coincide with the ones of [J. Garre Rubio et al, Quantum 7, 927 (2023)] using matrix product states (MPSs) techniques, by explicitly working out the GNS representation of MPSs and MPUs, resulting in a useful dictionary between both approaches that could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Polynomials with a Singularly Perturbed Airy Weight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to a singularly perturbed Airy weight. By using Chen and Ismail's ladder operator approach, we derive a discrete system satisfied by the recurrence coefficients for the orthogonal polynomials. We find that the orthogonal polynomials satisfy a second-order linear ordinary differential equation, whose coefficients are all expressed in terms of the recurrence coefficients. By considering the time evolution, we obtain a system of differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the recurrence coefficients when the degrees of the orthogonal polynomials tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics of 1d short-range Riesz gases in confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the full counting statistics (FCS) of a harmonically confined 1d short-range Riesz gas consisting of $N$ particles in equilibrium at finite temperature. The particles interact with each other through a repulsive power-law interaction with an exponent $k&gt;1$ which includes the Calogero-Moser model for $k=2$. We examine the probability distribution of the number of particles in a finite domain $[-W, W]$ called number distribution, denoted by $\mathcal{N}(W, N)$. We analyze the probability distribution of $\mathcal{N}(W, N)$ and show that it exhibits a large deviation form for large $N$ characterised by a speed $N^{\frac{3k+2}{k+2}}$ and by a large deviation function of the fraction $c = \mathcal{N}(W, N)/N$ of the particles inside the domain and $W$. We show that the density profiles that create the large deviations display interesting shape transitions as one varies $c$ and $W$. This is manifested by a third-order phase transition exhibited by the large deviation function that has discontinuous third derivatives. Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations show good agreement with our analytical expressions for the corresponding density profiles. We find that the typical fluctuations of $\mathcal{N}(W, N)$, obtained from our field theoretic calculations are Gaussian distributed with a variance that scales as $N^{\nu_k}$, with $\nu_k = (2-k)/(2+k)$. We also present some numerical findings on the mean and the variance. Furthermore, we adapt our formalism to study the index distribution (where the domain is semi-infinite $(-\infty, W])$, linear statistics (the variance), thermodynamic pressure and bulk modulus.</description>

      <title>Universality classes for percolation models with long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of percolation models where the local occupation variables have long-range correlations decaying as a power law $\sim r^{-a}$ at large distances $r$, for some $0&lt; a&lt; d$ where $d$ is the underlying spatial dimension. For several of these models, we present both, rigorous analytical results and matching simulations that determine the critical exponents characterizing the fixed point associated to their phase transition, which is of second order. The exact values we obtain are rational functions of the two parameters $a$ and $d$ alone, and do not depend on the specifics of the model.</description>

      <title>The secular equation for elastic surface waves under non standard boundary conditions of impedance type: A perspective from linear algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of elastic surface waves under impedance boundary conditions has become an intensive field of research due to their potential to model a wide range of problems. However, even when the secular equation, which provides the speed of the surface wave, can be explicitly derived, the analysis is limited to specific cases due to its cumbersome final expression. In this work, we present an alternative method based on linear algebra tools, to deal with the secular equation for surface waves in an isotropic elastic half-space subjected to non-standard boundary conditions of impedance type. They are defined by proportional relationships between both the stress and velocity components at the surface, with complex proportional ratios. Our analysis shows that the associated secular equation does not vanish in the upper complex half-plane including the real axis. Interestingly, the full impedance boundary conditions proposed by Godoy et al. [Wave Motion 49 (2012), 585-594] arise as a particular limit case. An approximation technique is introduced, in order to extend the analysis from the original problem to Godoy's impedance boundary conditions. As a result, it is shows that the secular equation with full Godoy's impedance boundary condition does not vanish outside the real axis. This is a crucial property for the well-posedness of the boundary value problem of partial differential equations, and thus crucial for the model to explain surface wave propagation. Due to the cumbersome secular equation, this property has been verified only for particular cases of the impedance boundary condition, namely the stress-free boundary condition (zero impedance) and when either one of the impedance parameter is set to zero (normal and tangential impedance cases).</description>

Abstract: Quantum connections are defined by parallel transport operators acting on a Hilbert space. They transport tangent operators along paths in parameter space. The metric tensor of a Riemannian manifold is replaced by an inner product of pairs of operator fields, similar to the inner product of the Kubo-Mori formalism of Linear Response Theory. The metric is used to define the dual of a quantum connection.The gradient of the parallel transport operators is the quantum vector potential. It defines the covariant derivative of operator fields. The covariant derivatives are used to quantify the holonomy of the quantum connection. It is shown that a quantum connection is holonomic if and only if its dual is holonomic. If the parallel transport operators are unitary then an alpha-family of quantum connections can be defined in a way similar to Amari's alpha family of connections in Information Geometry. The minus alpha connection is the dual of the alpha connection. In particular, the alpha equal zero connection is self-dual. An operator field can be combined with a path in parameter space to produce a path in operator space. A definition is given for such a path in operator space to be autoparallel. The path in parameter space is then a geodesic for the induced connection.</description>

      <title>Free energy expansions of a conditional GinUE and large deviations of the smallest eigenvalue of the LUE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a planar Coulomb gas ensemble of size $N$ with the inverse temperature $\beta=2$ and external potential $Q(z)=|z|^2-2c \log|z-a|$, where $c&gt;0$ and $a \in \mathbb{C}$. Equivalently, this model can be realised as $N$ eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix of size $(c+1) N \times (c+1) N$ conditioned to have deterministic eigenvalue $a$ with multiplicity $cN$. Depending on the values of $c$ and $a$, the droplet reveals a phase transition: it is doubly connected in the post-critical regime and simply connected in the pre-critical regime. In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble. Our proof is based on a refined Riemann-Hilbert analysis for planar orthogonal polynomials using the partial Schlesinger transform.</description>

      <title>Compatible E-differential forms on Lie algebroids over (pre-)multisymplectic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider higher generalizations of both a (twisted) Poisson structure and the equivariant condition of a momentum map on a symplectic manifold. On a Lie algebroid over a (pre-)symplectic and (pre-)multisymplectic manifold, we introduce a Lie algebroid differential form called a compatible E-n-form. This differential form satisfies a compatibility condition, which is consistent with both the Lie algebroid structure and the (pre-)(multi)symplectic structure. There are many interesting examples such as a Poisson structure, a twisted Poisson structure and a twisted R-Poisson structure for a pre-n-plectic manifold. Moreover, momentum maps and momentum sections on symplectic manifolds, homotopy momentum maps and homotopy momentum sections on multisymplectic manifolds have this structure.</description>

      <title>Boundary current fluctuations for the half space ASEP and six vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of the current at the boundary for the half space asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and the height function of the half space six vertex model at the boundary at large times. We establish a phase transition depending on the asymptotic density of particles at the boundary, with GSE and GOE limits as well as the Baik--Rains crossover distribution near the critical point. This was previously known for half space last passage percolation, and recently established for the half space log-gamma polymer and KPZ equation in the groundbreaking work of Imamura, Mucciconi, and Sasamoto.
  The proof uses the underlying algebraic structure of these models in a crucial way to obtain exact formulas. In particular, we show a relationship between the half space six vertex model and a half space Hall--Littlewood measure with two boundary parameters, which is then matched to a free boundary Schur process via a new identity of symmetric functions. Fredholm Pfaffian formulas are established for the half space ASEP and six vertex model, indicating a hidden free fermionic structure.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Calabi-Yau Crystals in BPS States Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of BPS D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles of a general toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We evaluate the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations. Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in quiver gauge theories.</description>
