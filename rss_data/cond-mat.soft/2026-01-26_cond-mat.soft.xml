      <title>Active Particle Destabilize Passive Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory for the interaction between active particles and a passive flexible membrane. By explicitly solving for the pressure exerted by the active particles, we show that they reduce the membrane tension and bending modulus and introduce novel non-local contributions to the membrane mechanics. This theory predicts activity-induced instabilities and their morphology are in agreement with recent experimental and simulation data.</description>

      <title>Hard disks confined within a narrow channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ inhomogeneous integral equation theory to investigate the equilibrium properties of hard disks confined to a channel of width $L$ by hard parallel walls. If the channel width is narrowed below two disk diameters, then the system enters a quasi one-dimensional regime for which the particles cannot move past each other. In the limit when $L$ is equal to one particle diameter the system reduces to the one-dimensional bulk along the center of the channel. We study first the dimensional crossover properties of the inhomogeneous Percus-Yevick (PY) integral equation as $L$ is reduced and then investigate the behaviour of a quasi one-dimensional system as the packing of the particles is increased for a fixed value of $L$. We find that the inhomogeneous PY equation is highly accurate for situations of quasi one-dimensional confinement and that it predicts the onset of a structural transition to a zigzag state at higher packing. The excellent performance of this integral equation method and the ease with which it handles confinement-induced dimensional crossover is a consequence of the improved resolution which comes from treating explicitly the inhomogeneous two-body correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the carbon dioxide hydrate-water interfacial energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide hydrates are ice-like nonstoichiometric inclusion solid compounds with importance to global climate change, and gas transportation and storage. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms that control carbon dioxide nucleation critically depend on hydrate-water interfacial free energy. Interfacial energies show large uncertainties due to the conditions at which experiments are performed. Under these circumstances, we hypothesize that accurate molecular models for water and carbon dioxide combined with computer simulation tools can offer an alternative but complementary way to estimate interfacial energies at coexistence conditions from a molecular perspective. We have evaluated the interfacial free energy of carbon dioxide hydrates at coexistence conditions (three-phase equilibrium or dissociation line) implementing advanced computational methodologies, including the novel Mold Integration methodology. Our calculations are based on the definition of the interfacial free energy, standard statistical thermodynamic techniques, and the use of the most reliable and used molecular models for water (TIP4P/Ice) and carbon dioxide (TraPPE) available in the literature. We find that simulations provide an interfacial energy value, at coexistence conditions, consistent with the experiments from its thermodynamic definition. Our calculations are reliable since are based on the use of two molecular models that accurately predict: (1) The ice-water interfacial free energy; and (2) the dissociation line of carbon dioxide hydrates. Computer simulation predictions provide alternative but reliable estimates of the carbon dioxide interfacial energy. Our pioneering work demonstrates that is possible to predict interfacial energies of hydrates from a truly computational molecular perspective and opens a new door to the determination of free energies of hydrates.</description>

      <title>Shear-Induced Wobbling and Motility Suppression in Swimming Bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate wobbling motion of flagellated bacteria, characterized by the periodic precession of the cell body, is a determinant factor in their motility and navigation within complex fluid environments. While well-studied in quiescent fluids, bacterial wobbling under ubiquitous flow conditions remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the wobbling dynamics of \textit{Escherichia coli} swimming near surfaces under steady shear flow. Our experiments reveal that the wobbling amplitude intensifies with flow strength before reaching a plateau, with this amplification exhibiting a strong dependence on the swimming orientation relative to the flow direction. It turns out that the enhanced wobbling remains governed by the misalignment between the cell body and the flagellar bundle. Furthermore, we observe that the wobbling frequency increases monotonically with flow strength, and that shorter bacteria exhibit more pronounced variations in both amplitude and frequency. By linking the wobbling motion to the intrinsic body-flagella misalignment, we attribute the flow-enhanced precession to a combination of shear- and chirality-induced torques acting on the flexible flagellar hook. This mechanical coupling ultimately suppresses the net migration velocity as the flow rate increases. These findings elucidate the elastohydrodynamic mechanisms by which shear flow modifies bacterial locomotion near surfaces, with implications for microbial transport in physiological and ecological environments.</description>

      <title>Negative Pressure and Cavitation Dynamics in Plant-like Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a solid (e.g. wood or rubber) can be put under tensile stress by pulling on it. Once a critical stress is overcome, the solid breaks, leaving an empty space. Similarly, due to internal cohesion, a liquid can withstand tension (i.e. negative pressure), up to a critical point where a large bubble spontaneously forms, releasing the tension and leaving a void (the bubble). This process is known as cavitation. While water at negative pressure is metastable, such a state can be long-lived. In fact, water under tension is found routinely in the plant kingdom, as a direct effect of dehydration, e.g. by evaporation. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of occurrences of water stress and cavitation in plants, then use a simple thermodynamic and fluid mechanical framework to describe the basic physics of water stress and cavitation. We focus specifically on situations close to those in plants, that is water at negative pressure nested within a structure that is solid, but porous and potentially deformable. We also discuss insights from these simple models as well as from experiments with artificial structures mimicking some essential aspects of the structures found within plants.</description>

      <title>Active Cahn--Hilliard theory for non-equilibrium phase separation: quantitative macroscopic predictions and a microscopic derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-separating active systems can display phenomenology that is impossible in equilibrium. The binodal densities are not solely determined by a bulk (effective) free energy, but also affected by gradient terms, while capillary waves and Ostwald processes are determined by three distinct interfacial tensions. These and related phenomena were so far explained at continuum level using a top-down minimal theory (Active Model B+). This theory, by Taylor-expanding in the scalar order parameter (or density), effectively assumes that phase separation is weak, which is not true across most of the phase diagram. Here we develop a quantitative account of active phase separation, by introducing an active counterpart of Cahn-Hilliard theory, constructing the density current from all possible terms with up to four spatial derivatives without Taylor-expanding in the density. From this O(grad^4) theory, we show how to compute binodals and interfacial tensions for arbitrary choices of the five density-dependent 'coefficient functions' that specify the theory (replacing the four constant coefficients of Active Model B+). We further consider a particle model composed of thermal quorum-sensing active particles (tQSAPs) yielding a fully specified example of the O(grad^4) theory upon coarse-graining. We find that to coarse-grain consistently at O(grad^4) requires a novel procedure, based on multiple-scale analysis, to systematically eliminate fast-evolving orientational moments. Using this, we calculate from microscopic physics all five coefficient functions of the active Cahn-Hilliard theory for tQSAPs. We identify contributions that were missed in previous continuum theories, and show how neglecting them becomes justified only in the limit of large quorum-sensing range parameter. Comparison with particle simulations of tQSAPs shows that our O(grad^4) theory improves on previous continuum models [...]</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions in Informational Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various biological and synthetic media out of equilibrium can be viewed as many-ratchet systems that rectify environmental noise through local measurements and information processing, like in Maxwell's prototypical demon. These systems pose a challenge to standard coarse-graining approaches because they are better described in terms of decision-making protocols similar to computer programs rather than force laws. Here, we study a many-body generalization of the Maxwell demon problem: a fluid composed of adaptive particles that achieve collective behavior by biasing noise-driven scattering events subject to measurements. Using a combination of information-theoretic, kinetic, and hydrodynamic tools, we elucidate how microscopic decision-making protocols, rather than microscopic forces, generate macroscopic active states sustained by continuous measurements. These include an informational version of flocking whose order parameter is bounded by the information measured, and the onset of which may be viewed as a measurement-induced phase transition. We find that the signature of such microscopic choices is an `informational activity' that selectively compresses phase space, without work, and causes deviations from equilibrium scaling with the magnitude of environmental noise. We envision applications to noise-induced patterning performed by collections of microrobots guided by reinforcement learning or programmable phoretic colloids in turbulent flows that exploit local measurements and control actions to counteract the scrambling of information by chaos.</description>

      <title>Bubble formation in active binary mixture model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase separation, the spontaneous segregation of density, is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed across diverse physical and biological systems. Within a crowd of motile elements, active phase separation emerges from the interplay of activity (i.e., self-propulsion) and density interactions. A striking feature of active phase separation is the persistent formation of dilute-phase bubbles within the dense phase, which has been explored in theoretical models. However, the fundamental parameters that systematically control bubble formation remain unclear in conventional self-propelled particle models. Here, we introduce an active binary mixture model in which solutes and solvents dynamically exchange positions on a lattice; both solutes and solvents are self-propelled particles, but solvents play a role analogous to empty space in typical dry active matter. Within this model, we find that spontaneous bubble formation of solvents can be tuned by activity asymmetry, which is the difference between the solute and solvent activities. Numerical simulations reveal that moderate solvent activity enhances bubble formation, while larger solvent activity, comparable to solute activity, suppresses it. By employing mean-field theory, which captures essential phase behaviors, we consider the mechanism for the enhancement of bubble formation induced by solvent activity. Beyond these findings, when solute and solvent activities are equal, we apply the finite-size scaling analysis to estimate the critical exponents for active phase separation under the suppression of bubbles. Our findings establish activity asymmetry as a key control parameter for active matter phase transitions, offering new insights into universality in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis in the freeze-thaw cycle of emulsions and suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Freeze-thaw cycles can be regularly observed in nature in water and are essential in industry and science. Objects present in the medium will interact with either an advancing solidification front during freezing or a retracting solidification front, i.e., an advancing melting front, during thawing. It is well known that objects show complex behaviours when interacting with the advancing solidification front, but the extent to which they are displaced during the retraction of the solid-liquid interface is less well understood. To study potential hysteresis effects during freeze-thaw cycles, we exploit experimental model systems of oil-in-water emulsions and polystyrene (PS) particle suspensions, in which a water-ice solidification front advances and retracts over an individual immiscible (and deformable) oil droplet or over a solid PS particle. We record several interesting hysteresis effects, resulting in non-zero relative displacements of the objects between freezing and thawing. PS particles tend to migrate further and further away from their initial position, whereas oil droplets tend to return to their starting positions during thawing. We rationalize our experimental findings by comparing them to our prior theoretical model of Meijer, Bertin &amp; Lohse, Phys. Rev. Fluids (2025), yielding a qualitatively good agreement. Additionally, we look into the reversibility of how the droplet deforms and re-shapes throughout one freeze-thaw cycle, which will turn out to be remarkably robust.</description>

      <title>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05420v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</description>
