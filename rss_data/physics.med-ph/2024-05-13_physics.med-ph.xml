      <title>Chained Flexible Capsule Endoscope: Unraveling the Conundrum of Size Limitations and Functional Integration for Gastrointestinal Transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capsule endoscopes, predominantly serving diagnostic functions, provide lucid internal imagery but are devoid of surgical or therapeutic capabilities. Consequently, despite lesion detection, physicians frequently resort to traditional endoscopic or open surgical procedures for treatment, resulting in more complex, potentially risky interventions. To surmount these limitations, this study introduces a chained flexible capsule endoscope (FCE) design concept, specifically conceived to navigate the inherent volume constraints of capsule endoscopes whilst augmenting their therapeutic functionalities. The FCE's distinctive flexibility originates from a conventional rotating joint design and the incision pattern in the flexible material. In vitro experiments validated the passive navigation ability of the FCE in rugged intestinal tracts. Further, the FCE demonstrates consistent reptile-like peristalsis under the influence of an external magnetic field, and possesses the capability for film expansion and disintegration under high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation. These findings illuminate a promising path toward amplifying the therapeutic capacities of capsule endoscopes without necessitating a size compromise.</description>

      <title>The depth of the banana and the impulse stripe illumination for diffuse optical tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stripe illumination lies between the illumination in the spatial-frequency domain and the point illumination. Although the stripe illumination has a periodic structure as the illumination in the spatial-frequency domain, light from the stripe illumination can reach deep regions in biological tissue since it can be regarded as an array of point illuminations. For a pair of a source and a detector, the shape of light paths which connect the source and detector is called the banana shape. First, we investigate the depth of the banana. In the case of the zero boundary condition, we found that the depth of the center of the banana is about $0.2d_{\rm SD}$ for typical optical parameters, where $d_{\rm SD}$ is the distance between the source and detector on the boundary. In general, the depth depends on the absorption and diffusion coefficients, and the ratio of refractive indices on the boundary. Next, we perform diffuse optical tomography for the stripe illumination against forward data taken by Monte Carlo simulation. We consider an impulse illumination of the shape of a stripe. By this time-resolved measurement, the absorption coefficient of a target is reconstructed.</description>

      <title>Novel Method to Estimate Kinetic Microparameters from Dynamic Whole-Body Imaging in Regular-Axial Field-of-View PET Scanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For whole-body (WB) kinetic modeling based on a typical PET scanner, a multi-pass multi-bed scanning protocol is necessary given the limited axial field-of-view. Such a protocol introduces loss of early-dynamics in time-activity curves (TACs) and sparsity in TAC measurements, inducing uncertainty in parameter estimation when using least-squares estimation (LSE) (i.e., common standard) especially for kinetic microparameters. We present a method to reliably estimate microparameters, enabling accurate parametric imaging, on regular-axial field-of-view PET scanners. Our method, denoted parameter combination-driven estimation (PCDE), relies on generation of reference truth TAC database, and subsequently selecting, the best parameter combination as the one arriving at TAC with highest total similarity score (TSS), focusing on general image quality, overall visibility, and tumor detectability metrics. Our technique has two distinctive characteristics: 1) improved probability of having one-on-one mapping between early and late dynamics in TACs (the former missing from typical protocols), and 2) use of multiple aspects of TACs in selection of best fits. To evaluate our method against conventional LSE, we plotted tradeoff curves for noise and bias. In addition, the overall SNR and spatial noise were calculated and compared. Furthermore, CNR and TBR were also calculated. We also tested our proposed method on patient data (18F-DCFPyL PET scans) to further verify clinical applicability. Significantly improved general image quality performance was verified in microparametric images (e.g. noise-bias performance). The overall visibility and tumor detectability were also improved. Finally, for our patient studies, improved overall visibility and tumor detectability were demonstrated in micoparametric images, compared to use of conventional parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Learning the Domain Specific Inverse NUFFT for Accelerated Spiral MRI using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for accelerated MRI achieve state-of-the-art results but largely ignore additional speedups possible with noncartesian sampling trajectories. To address this gap, we created a generative diffusion model-based reconstruction algorithm for multi-coil highly undersampled spiral MRI. This model uses conditioning during training as well as frequency-based guidance to ensure consistency between images and measurements. Evaluated on retrospective data, we show high quality (structural similarity &gt; 0.87) in reconstructed images with ultrafast scan times (0.02 seconds for a 2D image). We use this algorithm to identify a set of optimal variable-density spiral trajectories and show large improvements in image quality compared to conventional reconstruction using the non-uniform fast Fourier transform. By combining efficient spiral sampling trajectories, multicoil imaging, and deep learning reconstruction, these methods could enable the extremely high acceleration factors needed for real-time 3D imaging.</description>
