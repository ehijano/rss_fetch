      <title>S2-star dynamics probing the Galaxy core cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10567v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star cluster surrounding the supermassive black hole in the center of Milky Way is probed using the data on the S2 star. The value of precession found at the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) analysis of the S2 data is used to consider the role of the scattering of S2 star on stars of the cluster, described by a random force given by the Holtsmark distribution. The critical value for the star density of the core cluster for which the observed precession value by PINN lies inside 70% confidence interval (between 15% and 85% quantiles) around the median of precession due to scattering, is obtained as n_crit \approx 8.3 10^6 pc^-3, that is at higher star densities the perturbation of the orbit of S2 would exceed the observed one.</description>

      <title>Candidate ram-pressure stripped galaxies in six low-redshift clusters revealed from ultraviolet imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assembly of galaxy clusters is understood to be a hierarchical process with a continuous accretion of galaxies over time, which increases the cluster size and mass. Late-type galaxies that fall into clusters can undergo ram-pressure stripping, forming extended gas tails within which star formation can happen. The number, location, and tail orientations of such galaxies provide clues about the galaxy infall process, the assembly of the cluster over time, and the consequences of infall for galaxy evolution. Here, we utilise the $\sim$ 0.5 degree diameter circular field of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope to image six galaxy clusters at z &lt; 0.06 that are known to contain jellyfish galaxies. We searched for stripping candidates in the ultraviolet images of these clusters, which revealed 54 candidates showing signs of unilateral extra-planar emission, due to ram-pressure stripping. Seven candidates had already been identified as likely stripping based on optical B-band imaging. We identified 47 new candidates through UV imaging. Spectroscopic redshift information is available for 39 of these candidate galaxies, of which 19 are associated with six clusters. The galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that are not part of the clusters appear to be within structures at different redshifts identified as additional peaks in the redshift distribution of galaxies, indicating that they might be ram-pressure stripped or disturbed galaxies in other structures along the line of sight. We examine the orbital history of these galaxies based on their location in the position-velocity phase-space diagram and explore a possible connection to the orientation of the tail direction among cluster member candidates. The tails of confirmed cluster member galaxies are found to be oriented away from the cluster centre.</description>

      <title>Effects of secular growth and mergers on the evolution of metallicity gradients and azimuthal variations in a Milky Way-like galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of the radial profiles and the azimuthal variations of the stellar metallicities from the Vintergatan simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that negative gradients exist as soon as the disk settles at high redshift, and are maintained throughout the long term evolution of the galaxy, including during major merger events. The inside-out growth of the disk and an overall outward radial migration tend to flatten these gradients in time. Major merger events only have a moderate and short-lived imprint on the [Fe/H] distributions with almost no radial dependence. The reason lies in the timescale for enrichment in Fe being significantly longer than the duration of the starbursts episodes, themselves slower than dynamical mixing during typical interactions. It results that signatures of major mergers become undetectable in [Fe/H] only a few Myr after pericenter passages. We note that considering other tracers like the warm interstellar medium, or monitoring the evolution of the metallicity gradient as a single value instead of a radial full profile could lead to different interpretations, and warn against an oversimplification of this complex problem.</description>

      <title>Deciphering spatially resolved Lyman-alpha profiles in reionization analogs: the Sunburst Arc at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission line, the brightest spectral feature of a photoionized gas, is considered an indirect tracer of the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons, particularly when the intergalactic medium is too opaque for direct detection. However, resonant scattering complicates interpreting the empirical properties of Lya photons, necessitating radiative transfer simulations to capture their strong coupling with underlying gas kinematics. In this study, we leverage the exceptional spatial resolution from strong gravitational lensing to investigate the connection between Lya line profiles and LyC leakage on scales of a few 100 pc in the Sunburst Arc galaxy at $z\sim2.37$. New optical echelle spectra obtained using Magellan MIKE show that both the LyC leaking and non-leaking regions exhibit a classic double-peak Lya feature with an enhanced red peak, indicating outflows at multiple locations in the galaxy. Both regions also show a central Gaussian peak atop the double peaks, indicating directly escaped Lya photons independent of LyC leakage. We introduce a machine learning-based method for emulating Lya simulations to quantify intrinsic dynamics ($\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$), neutral hydrogen column density ($N_{\mathrm{HI}}$), outflow velocity ($v_{\mathrm{exp}}$), and effective temperature ($T$) across continuous parameter spaces. By comparing the spatially and spectrally resolved Lya lines in Sunburst, we argue that the directly escaped Lya photons originate in a volume-filling, warm ionized medium spanning $\sim1$ kpc, while the LyC leakage is confined to regions of $\lesssim200$ pc. These sub-kpc variations in Lya profiles highlight the complexity of interpreting integrated properties in the presence of inhomogeneous mixtures of gas and young stars, emphasizing the need for spatially and spectrally resolved observations of distant galaxies.</description>

      <title>Assembly of the Intracluster Light in the Horizon-AGN Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters made up of intergalactic stars is termed the intracluster light (ICL). Though there is a developing understanding of the mechanisms by which the ICL is formed, no strong consensus has yet been reached on which objects the stars of the ICL are primarily sourced from. We investigate the assembly of the ICL starting approximately $10$ Gyr before $z=0$ in 11 galaxy clusters (halo masses between $\sim1\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim7\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $z\approx0$) in the Horizon-AGN simulation. By tracking the stars of galaxies that fall into these clusters past cluster infall, we are able to link almost all of the $z\approx0$ ICL back to progenitor objects. Satellite stripping, mergers, and pre-processing are all found to make significant contributions to the ICL, but any contribution from in-situ star-formation directly into the ICL appears negligible. Even after compensating for resolution effects, we find that approximately $90$ per cent of the stacked ICL of the 11 clusters that is not pre-processed should come from galaxies infalling with stellar masses above $10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, with roughly half coming from infalling galaxies with stellar masses within half a dex of $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. The fact that the ICL appears largely sourced from such massive objects suggests that the ICL assembly of any individual cluster may be principally stochastic.</description>

      <title>A phenomenological model for bright galaxies in the high-redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Telescope (JWST) have unveiled numerous galaxy candidates between $z \sim 9 - 16.5$, hinting at an over-abundance of the bright-end of the UV Luminosity Function (UV LF) $z \gtrsim 11$. Possible solutions require extremely bursty star formation, these systems being dust-free, an evolving initial mass function or even cosmic variance. In this work, we develop an analytic formalism to study dust enrichment and its impact on the UV luminosity of both main-sequence early galaxies and extremely bursty star formers. Our dust model, including the key processes of dust production in type II Supernovae, dust destruction, ejection, growth and sputtering, is calibrated against the latest datasets from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) at $z \sim 4-7$. The model has only 3 free parameters: (i) the star formation efficiency; (ii) the dust growth timescale; and (iii) the dust distribution radius. Our key results are: (i) explaining the observed UV LF requires an average star formation efficiency that increases with redshift as $f_*(z) = 10^{0.13z-3.5}$ at $z \sim 5-13$ with a number of observations hinting at objects lying a factor 10 above this main-sequence. (ii) The dust enrichment of early systems is driven by dust production in SNII ejecta; growth and sputtering are the second and third most crucial processes, impacting the dust mass by 60% and 40% respectively at $z \sim 7$. (iii) In our model, galaxies at $z \gtrsim 9$ can still host significant amounts of dust reaching average dust-to-stellar mass ratios of 0.19% (0.14%) at $z \sim 9$ ($z \sim 11$). Dust attenuation decreases with redshift due to dust being increasingly more dispersed within the halo. (iv) the galaxies observed by ALMA at $z \sim 7$ comprise a biased sample that is not representative of the average population that makes up the UV LF.</description>

      <title>Inferring stellar parameters and their uncertainties from high-resolution spectroscopy using invertible neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: New spectroscopic surveys will increase the number of astronomical objects requiring characterization by over tenfold.. Machine learning tools are required to address this data deluge in a fast and accurate fashion. Most machine learning algorithms can not estimate error directly, making them unsuitable for reliable science.
  Aims: We aim to train a supervised deep-learning algorithm tailored for high-resolution observational stellar spectra. This algorithm accurately infer precise estimates while providing coherent estimates of uncertainties by leveraging information from both the neural network and the spectra.
  Methods: We train a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN) on observational spectroscopic data obtained from the GIRAFFE spectrograph (HR10 and HR21 setups) within the Gaia-ESO survey. A key features of cINN is its ability to produce the Bayesian posterior distribution of parameters for each spectrum. By analyzing this distribution, we inferred parameters and their uncertainties. Several tests have been applied to study how parameters and errors are estimated.
  Results: We achieved an accuracy of 28K in $T_{\text{eff}}$, 0.06 dex in $\log g$, 0.03 dex in $[\text{Fe/H}]$, and between 0.05 dex and 0.17 dex for the other abundances for high quality spectra. Accuracy remains stable with low signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The uncertainties obtained are well within the same order of magnitude. The network accurately reproduces astrophysical relationships both on the scale of the Milky Way and within smaller star clusters. We created a table containing the new parameters generated by our cINN.
  Conclusion: This neural network represents a compelling proposition for future astronomical surveys. These coherent derived uncertainties make it possible to reuse these estimates in other works as Bayesian priors and thus present a solid basis for future work.</description>

      <title>A machine learning framework to generate star cluster realisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Computational astronomy has reached the stage where running a gravitational N-body simulation of a stellar system, such as a Milky Way star cluster, is computationally feasible, but a major limiting factor that remains is the ability to set up physically realistic initial conditions. Aims. We aim to obtain realistic initial conditions for N-body simulations by taking advantage of machine learning, with emphasis on reproducing small-scale interstellar distance distributions. Methods. The computational bottleneck for obtaining such distance distributions is the hydrodynamics of star formation, which ultimately determine the features of the stars, including positions, velocities, and masses. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a new method for sampling physically realistic initial conditions from a limited set of simulations using Gaussian processes. Results. We evaluated the resulting sets of initial conditions based on whether they meet tests for physical realism. We find that direct sampling based on the learned distribution of the star features fails to reproduce binary systems. Consequently, we show that physics-informed sampling algorithms solve this issue, as they are capable of generating realisations closer to reality.</description>

      <title>A Luminous X-ray AGN in the Dwarf-Dwarf Galaxy Merger RGG 66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray AGN in the dwarf galaxy merger RGG 66. The black hole is predicted to have a mass of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5.4} M_\odot$ and to be radiating close to its Eddington limit ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.75$). The AGN in RGG 66 is notable both for its presence in a late-stage dwarf-dwarf merger and for its luminosity of $L_{\rm 2-10~keV} = 10^{42.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is among the most powerful AGNs known in nearby dwarf galaxies. The X-ray spectrum has a best-fit photon index of $\Gamma = 2.4$ and an intrinsic absorption of $N_H \sim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. These results come from a follow-up {\it Chandra X-ray Observatory} study of four irregular/disturbed dwarf galaxies with evidence for hosting AGNs based on optical spectroscopy.
  The remaining three dwarf galaxies do not have detectable X-ray sources with upper limits of $L_{\rm 2-10~ keV} \lesssim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Taken at face value, our results on RGG 66 suggest that mergers may trigger the most luminous of AGNs in the dwarf galaxy regime, just as they are suspected to do in more massive galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>The Astrid Simulation: Evolution of black holes and galaxies to z=0.5 and different evolution pathways for galaxy quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results from the ASTRID simulation from $z=3$ to $z=0.5$, covering the epoch of cosmic noon. The galaxy stellar mass function, as well as the black hole mass and luminosity functions in ASTRID, exhibit good agreement with recent observational constraints. We study the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ scaling relation and its connections to AGN luminosity, galaxy color, and star formation rate, demonstrating that AGN feedback plays a crucial role in the quenching of massive galaxies ($M_*&gt;10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$). Although AGN feedback suppresses star formation through quenching, AGN-host galaxies still exhibit statistically higher levels of star formation compared to inactive ones, due to the positive correlation between AGN activity and star formation, both fueled by a shared gas reservoir. The fraction of quiescent galaxies in ASTRID increases with both galaxy mass and redshift evolution, aligning well with observational trends. We find that different quenching mechanisms can leave distinct morphological imprints on quenched galaxies. Massive, compact quiescent galaxies typically experience shorter quenching timescales, have younger central regions, and host overmassive black holes. This is usually due to a compaction-like quenching mechanism that funnels gas into the galaxy center, leading to starbursts and triggering AGN kinetic feedback. In contrast, quiescent galaxies with more diffuse morphologies generally experience `inside-out' quenching, which is characterized by older central regions compared to the outskirts. These galaxies typically experience longer quenching timescales due to quenching processes operating on a larger halo scale, which gradually deplete the galactic star-forming gas. Data of the \astrid simulation down to $z=0.5$ is available at \url{https://astrid.psc.edu}.</description>

      <title>Deconvolving X-ray Galaxy Cluster Spectra Using a Recurrent Inference Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning algorithms have unlocked new insights in observational astronomy by allowing astronomers to probe new frontiers. In this article, we present a methodology to disentangle the intrinsic X-ray spectrum of galaxy clusters from the instrumental response function. Employing state-of-the-art modeling software and data mining techniques of the Chandra data archive, we construct a set of 100,000 mock Chandra spectra. We train a recurrent inference machine (RIM) to take in the instrumental response and mock observation and output the intrinsic X-ray spectrum. The RIM can recover the mock intrinsic spectrum below the 1-$\sigma$ error threshold; moreover, the RIM reconstruction of the mock observations are indistinguishable from the observations themselves. To further test the algorithm, we deconvolve extracted spectra from the central regions of the galaxy group NGC 1550, known to have a rich X-ray spectrum, and the massive galaxy clusters Abell 1795. Despite the RIM reconstructions consistently remaining below the 1-$\sigma$ noise level, the recovered intrinsic spectra did not align with modeled expectations. This discrepancy is likely attributable to the RIM's method of implicitly encoding prior information within the neural network. This approach holds promise for unlocking new possibilities in accurate spectral reconstructions and advancing our understanding of complex X-ray cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL Survey: Spatially-resolved Star Formation Activity and Dust Content in 4 &lt; z &lt; 6 Star-forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a combination of HST, JWST, and ALMA data, we perform spatially resolved spectral energy distributions (SED) fitting of fourteen 4&lt;z&lt;6 UV-selected main-sequence galaxies targeted by the [CII] Resolved ISM in Star-forming Galaxies with ALMA (CRISTAL) Large Program. We consistently model the emission from stars and dust in ~0.5-1kpc spatial bins to obtain maps of their physical properties. We find no offsets between the stellar masses (M*) and star formation rates (SFRs) derived from their global emission and those from adding up the values in our spatial bins, suggesting there is no bias of outshining by young stars on the derived global properties. We show that ALMA observations are important to derive robust parameter maps because they reduce the uncertainties in Ldust (hence Av and SFR). Using these maps we explore the resolved star-forming main sequence for z~5 galaxies, finding that this relation persists in typical star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. We find less obscured star formation where the M* (and SFR) surface densities are highest, typically in the central regions, contrary to the global relation between these parameters. We speculate this could be caused by feedback driving gas and dust out of these regions. However, more observations of infrared luminosities with ALMA are needed to verify this. Finally, we test empirical SFR prescriptions based on the UV+IR and [CII] line luminosity, finding they work well at the scales probed (~kpc). Our work demonstrates the usefulness of joint HST, JWST, and ALMA resolved SED modeling analyses at high redshift.</description>

      <title>JWST PRIMER: A lack of outshining in four normal z =4-6 galaxies from the ALMA-CRISTAL Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially resolved analysis of four star-forming galaxies at $z = 4.44-5.64$ using data from the JWST PRIMER and ALMA-CRISTAL surveys to probe the stellar and inter-stellar medium properties on the sub-kpc scale. In the $1-5\,\mu{\rm m}$ JWST NIRCam imaging we find that the galaxies are composed of multiple clumps (between $2$ and $\sim 8$) separated by $\simeq 5\,{\rm kpc}$, with comparable morphologies and sizes in the rest-frame UV and optical. Using BAGPIPES to perform pixel-by-pixel SED fitting to the JWST data we show that the SFR ($\simeq 25\,{\rm M}_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$) and stellar mass (${\rm log}_{10}(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \simeq 9.5$) derived from the resolved analysis are in close ($ \lesssim 0.3\,{\rm dex}$) agreement with those obtained by fitting the integrated photometry. In contrast to studies of lower-mass sources, we thus find a reduced impact of outshining of the older (more massive) stellar populations in these normal $z \simeq 5$ galaxies. Our JWST analysis recovers bluer rest-frame UV slopes ($\beta \simeq -2.1$) and younger ages ($\simeq 100\,{\rm Myr}$) than archival values. We find that the dust continuum from ALMA-CRISTAL seen in two of these galaxies correlates, as expected, with regions of redder rest-frame UV slopes and the SED-derived $A_{\rm V}$, as well as the peak in the stellar mass map. We compute the resolved IRX-$\beta$ relation, showing that the IRX is consistent with the local starburst attenuation curve and further demonstrating the presence of an inhomogeneous dust distribution within the galaxies. A comparison of the CRISTAL sources to those from the FirstLight zoom-in simulation of galaxies with the same $M_{\star}$ and SFR reveals similar age and colour gradients, suggesting that major mergers may be important in the formation of clumpy galaxies at this epoch.</description>

      <title>CO spectra of the ISM in the Host Galaxies of the Most Luminous WISE-Selected AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of mid-J J=4-3 or J=5-4 carbon monoxide (CO) emission lines and continuum emission from a sample of ten of the most luminous log(L/L_solar)~14 Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with redshifts up to 4.6. We uncover broad spectral lines (FWHM~400 km/s) in these objects, suggesting a turbulent molecular interstellar medium (ISM) may be ubiquitous in Hot DOGs. A halo of molecular gas, extending out to a radius of 5 kpc is observed in W2305-0039, likely supplied by 940 km/s molecular outflows. W0831+0140 is plausibly the host of a merger between at least two galaxies, consistent with observations made using ionized gas. These CO(4-3) observations contrast with previous CO(1-0) studies of the same sources: the CO(4-3) to CO(1-0) luminosity ratios exceed 300 in each source, suggesting that the lowest excited states of CO are underluminous. These findings show that the molecular gas in Hot DOGs is consistently turbulent, plausibly a consequence of AGN feedback, triggered by galactic mergers.</description>

      <title>Physical conditions in Centaurus A's northern filaments II: Does the HCO$^+$ emission highlight the presence of shocks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abridged: We present the first observation of the HCO+(1-0) and HCN(1-0) emission in the northern filaments of Centaurus A with ALMA. HCO+(1-0) is detected in 9 clumps of the Horseshoe complex, with similar velocities as the CO(1-0) emission. Conversely, the HCN(1-0) is not detected and we derive upper limits on the flux. At a resolution of ~40 pc, the line ratio of the velocity-integrated intensities I_HCO+/I_CO varies between 0.03 and 0.08, while I_HCO+/I_HCN is higher than unity with an average lower limit of 1.51. These ratios are significantly higher than what is observed in nearby star-forming galaxies. Moreover, the ratio I_HCO+/I_CO decreases with increasing CO integrated intensity, contrary to what is observed in the star-forming galaxies. This indicates that the HCO+ emission is enhanced and may not arise from dense gas within the Horseshoe complex. This hypothesis is strengthened by the average line ratio I_HCN/I_CO&lt;0.03 which suggests that the gas density is rather low. Using non-LTE, large velocity gradient modelling with RADEX, we explored two possible phases of the gas, that we call "diffuse" and "dense", and are characterised by a significant difference in the HCO+ relative abundance to CO, respectively N_HCO+/N_CO=10^-3 and 3x10^-5. The average CO(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) integrated intensities and the upper limit on HCN(1-0) are compatible with both "diffuse" and "dense" gas. The spectral setup of the present observations also covers the SiO(2-1). While undetected, the upper limit on SiO(2-1) is not compatible with the RADEX predictions for the "dense" gas. We conclude that the 9 molecular clouds detected in HCO+(1-0) are likely dominated by diffuse molecular gas. While the exact origin of the HCO+(1-0) emission remains to be investigated, it is likely related to the energy injection within the molecular gas that prevents gravitational collapse and star formation.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting cosmic filaments in Lyman-alpha emission across redshifts $z=2-5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard $\rm \Lambda$CDM cosmological model predicts that a large amount of diffuse neutral hydrogen distributes in cosmic filaments, which could be mapped through Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission observations. We use the hydrodynamical simulation Illustris-TNG50 to investigate the evolution of surface brightness and detectability of neutral hydrogen in cosmic filaments across redshifts $z=2-5$. While the HI column density of cosmic filaments decreases with redshift, due to the rising temperature with cosmic time in filaments, the surface brightness of Ly$\alpha$ emission in filaments is brighter at lower redshifts, suggesting that the detection of cosmic filaments is more feasible at lower redshifts. However, most of the Ly$\alpha$ emission from cosmic filaments is around $10^{-21}$ $\rm erg\ s^{-1}cm^{-2}arsec^{-2}$, making it extremely challenging to detect with current observational instruments. We further generate mock images using the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectrograph installed on both the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Our finding indicates that while the VLT can only detect filamentary structures made of dense gas in galactic centers, the ELT is expected to reveal much finer filamentary structures from diffuse neutral hydrogen outside of galaxies. Compared to the VLT, both the number density and the longest length of filaments are greatly boosted with the ELT. Hence the forthcoming ELT is highly promising to provide a clearer view of cosmic filaments in Ly$\alpha$ emission.</description>

      <title>Evidence for gravitational self-lensing of the central supermassive black hole binary in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1566</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that all massive galaxies host supermassive black holes (BHs) in their center and that mergers of two galaxies lead to the formation of BH binaries. The most interesting among them comprise the mergers in their final state, that is to say with parsec (3.2 light years) or sub-parsec orbital separations. It is possible to detect these systems with binary self-lensing. Here we report the potential detection of a central supermassive BH binary in the active galaxy (AGN) NGC1566 based on a microlensing outburst. The light curve of the outburst - based on observations with the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae - lasted from the beginning of 2017 until the beginning of 2020. The steep symmetric light curve as well as its shape look very different with respect to normal random variations in AGN. However, the observations could be easily reproduced with a best-fit standard microlensing light curve. Based on the light curve, we derived a characteristic timescale of 155 days. During the outburst, the continuum as well as the broad line intensities varied; however, the narrow emission lines did not. This is an indication that the lensing object orbits the AGN nucleus between the broad line region (BLR) and the narrow line region (NLR), that is, at a distance on the order of 250 light days. The light curve can be reproduced by a lens with a BH mass of 5*10^{5} M_solar. This implies a mass ratio to the central AGN on the order of 1 to 10.</description>

      <title>Imaging fermionic dark matter cores at the center of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current images of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidates at the center of our Galaxy and M87 have opened an unprecedented era for studying strong gravity and the nature of relativistic sources. Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) data show images consistent with a central SMBH within General Relativity (GR). However, it is essential to consider whether other well-motivated dark compact objects within GR could produce similar images. Recent studies have shown that dark matter (DM) halos modeled as self-gravitating systems of neutral fermions can harbor very dense fermionic cores at their centers, which can mimic the spacetime features of a black hole (BH). Such dense, horizonless DM cores can satisfy the observational constraints: they can be supermassive and compact and lack a hard surface. We investigate whether such cores can produce similar observational signatures to those of BHs when illuminated by an accretion disk. We compute images and spectra of the fermion cores with a general-relativistic ray tracing technique, assuming the radiation originates from standard $\alpha$ disks, which are self-consistently solved within the current DM framework. Our simulated images possess a central brightness depression surrounded by a ring-like feature, resembling what is expected in the BH scenario. For Milky Way-like halos, the central brightness depressions have diameters down to $\sim 35\, \mu$as as measured from a distance of approximately $8\,$kpc. Finally, we show that the DM cores do not possess photon rings, a key difference from the BH paradigm, which could help discriminate between the models.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $1.8\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $40-600\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <title>Galactic Compton Wavelengths in $f(R)$ Screening Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $f(R)$ theories of modified gravity may be compatible with current observations if the deviations from general relativity are sufficiently well screened in dense environments. In recent work [arXiv:2310.19955] we have shown that approximations commonly used to assess whether galaxies are screened, or unscreened, fail to hold in observationally interesting parts of parameter space. One of the assumptions commonly made in these approximations, and more broadly in the study of $f(R)$ models, is that the mass of the scalar mode can be neglected inside a galaxy. In this work we demonstrate that this approximation may fail spectacularly and discuss the implications of this for tests of the theory.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Kinematics of SLACS Lens Galaxies. I: Data and Kinematic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain spatially resolved kinematics with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) integral-field spectrograph for a sample of 14 massive (11 &lt; log10 M* &lt; 12) lensing early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts z=0.15-0.35 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We integrate within the galaxy effective radius and examine the rotational and dispersion velocities, showing that 11/14 are quantitatively classified as slow rotators in comparison with local galaxy surveys. Of key interest is the ability of this data to enable the precision required for cosmological inference with lensing time delays on scales of 1-2% uncertainty. The dataset is unprecedented for galaxy-scale lens galaxies, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, sampling, and calibration. We test sources of systematic error and identify primary contributions from choice of stellar template library and wavelength range of the spectral fit. Systematics are quantified at the spatial bin level, resulting in systematic error at 3% and positive spatial covariance of 2%. We examine the effects of integration of the kinematic maps within circular apertures of different sizes and compare with SDSS single-aperture velocity dispersions. The most recent velocity dispersion estimates from SDSS spectra are found to be biased by a factor of 5.3% with respect to KCWI data, and to underestimate uncertainties. We examine correlations between scaling relations and show the correlations to agree with previous SLACS analysis with no statistically significant disagreement. A follow-up paper will present Jeans modeling and discuss the context of these observations within broader studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>A close pair of orbiters embedded in a gaseous disk: the repulsive effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework and use two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to study the repulsive effect between two close orbiters embedded in an accretion disk. We consider orbiters on fixed Keplerian orbits with masses low enough to open shallow gaps. The simulations indicate that the repulsion is larger for more massive orbiters and decreases with the orbital separation and the disk's viscosity. We use two different assumptions to derive theoretical scaling relations for the repulsion. A first scenario assumes that each orbiter absorbs the angular momentum deposited in its horseshoe region by the companion's wake. A second scenario assumes that the corotation torques of the orbiters are modified because the companion changes the underlying radial gradient of the disk surface density. We find a substantial difference between the predictions of these two scenarios. The first one fails to reproduce the scaling of the repulsion with the disk viscosity and generally overestimates the strength of the repulsion. The second scenario, however, gives results that are broadly consistent with those obtained in the simulations.</description>

      <title>AESOPUS 2.1: Low-Temperature Opacities Extended to High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the critical need for accurate Rosseland mean gas opacities in high-pressure environments, spanning temperatures from 100 K to 32000 K. Current opacity tables from Wichita State University and AESOPUS 2.0 are limited to $\log(R) \le 1$, where $R=\rho\, T_6^{-3}$ in units of $\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}(10^6\mathrm{K})^{-3}$. This is insufficient for modeling very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planets with atmospheres exhibiting higher densities and pressures ($\log(R) &gt; 1$). Leveraging extensive databases such as ExoMol, ExoMolOP, MoLLIST, and HITEMP, we focus on expanding the AESOPUS opacity calculations to cover a broad range of pressure and density conditions ($-8 \leq \log(R) \leq +6$). We incorporate the thermal Doppler mechanism and micro-turbulence velocity. Pressure broadening effects on molecular transitions, leading to Lorentzian or Voigt profiles, are explored in the context of atmospheric profiles for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars. We also delve into the impact of electron degeneracy and non-ideal effects such as ionization potential depression under high-density conditions, emphasizing its notable influence on Rosseland mean opacities at temperatures exceeding $10,000$ K. As a result, this study expands AESOPUS public web interface for customized gas chemical mixtures, promoting flexibility in opacity calculations based on specific research needs. Additionally, pre-computed opacity tables, inclusive of condensates, are provided. We present a preliminary application to evolutionary models for very low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Investigating the CREDIT history of supernova remnants as cosmic-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet, while many SNRs have been observed in non-thermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma-rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.</description>

      <title>MINDS. JWST-MIRI Observations of a Spatially Resolved Atomic Jet and Polychromatic Molecular Wind Toward SY Cha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.</description>

      <title>Features and prospects for Kilonova remnant detection with current and future surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the observable spectral and temporal properties of kilonova remnants analytically, and showcase quantitative differences with respect to supernova remnants. We provide detection prospects of kilonova remnants in the context of ongoing radio surveys. We find that there is a good chance to expect 10s of such objects in future surveys with a flux threshold of $\sim 0.1$ mJy. Kilonova remnants from a postulated population of long lived supramassive neutron star remnants of neutron star mergers are even more likely to be detected as they are extremely bright and peak earlier. For ongoing survey with threshold of $\sim$ mJy, we expect to find 10-100s of such objects if they are a significant fraction of total kilonova population. Considering that there are no promising such kilonovae candidates in current surveys, we constrain the fraction of such extreme kilonova to be no more than 30 percent of the overall kilonovae rate, depending on the details of ejecta mass and external density distribution.</description>

      <title>Hertzsprung gap stars in nearby galaxies and the Quest for Luminous Red Novae Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the main sequence phase, stars more massive than 2.5 M$_\odot$ rapidly evolve through the Hertzsprung gap as yellow giants and supergiants (YSG), before settling into the red giant branch. Identifying YSG in nearby galaxies is crucial for pinpointing progenitors of luminous red novae (LRNe) - astrophysical transients attributed to stellar mergers. In the era of extensive transient surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST, this approach offers a new way to predict and select common envelope transients. This study investigates potential progenitors and precursors of LRNe by analysing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of stellar populations in galaxies within 20 Mpc to identify YSG candidates. Additionally, we use ZTF and MeerLICHT/BlackGEM to identify possible precursors, preparing for future observations by the LSST. We compiled a sample of 369 galaxies with HST exposures in the F475W, F555W, F606W, and F814W filters. We identified YSG candidates using MESA stellar evolution tracks and statistical analysis of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Our sample includes 246,573 YSG candidates with masses between 3 and 20 $M_\odot$ and is affected by various contaminants, such as foreground stars and extinguished main-sequence stars. After excluding foreground stars using Gaia proper motions, contamination is estimated at 1.7\% from foreground stars and 20\% from extinction affecting main-sequence stars. Combining our YSG candidates with time-domain catalogs yielded several interesting candidates. Notably, we identified 12 LRN precursor candidates for which followup is encouraged. We highlight the importance of monitoring future transients that match YSG candidates to avoid missing potential LRNe and other rare transients. LSST will be a game changer in the search for LRN progenitors and precursors, discovering over 300,000 new YSG and 100 precursors within 20 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Resolving Dual Active Galactic Nuclei with ~100 pc separation in MCG-03-34-64</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07717v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a candidate dual black hole system with a separation of ~100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z=0.016). Hubble Space Telescope/ACS observations show three distinct optical centroids in the [O III] narrow-band and F814W images. Subsequent analysis of Chandra/ACIS data shows two spatially-resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe Ka (6.2-6.6 keV) band, while high-resolution radio continuum observations with the Very Large Array at 8.46 GHz (3.6 cm band) show two spatially-coincident radio peaks. Fast shocks as the ionizing source seem unlikely, given the energies required for production of Fe Ka. If confirmed, the separation of ~100 pc would represent the closest dual AGN reported to date with spatially-resolved, multiwavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant in the analysis predicts these masses to be higher by 5-10\%. For instance the Local Group of Galaxies is estimated to be $(2.47 \pm 0.08) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>The First Combined H$\alpha$ and Rest-UV Spectroscopic Probe of Galactic Outflows at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-phase structure of gas flows in galaxies. We study 80 galaxies during the epoch of peak star formation ($1.4\leq z\leq2.7$) using data from Keck/LRIS and VLT/KMOS. Our analysis provides a simultaneous probe of outflows using UV emission and absorption features and H$\alpha$ emission. With this unprecedented data set, we examine the properties of gas flows estimated from LRIS and KMOS in relation to other galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR), star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), stellar mass (M$_*$), and main sequence offset ($\Delta$MS). We find no strong correlations between outflow velocity measured from rest-UV lines centroids and galaxy properties. However, we find that galaxies with detected outflows show higher averages in SFR, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, and $\Delta$MS than those lacking outflow detections, indicating a connection between outflow and galaxy properties. Furthermore, we find a lower average outflow velocity than previously reported, suggesting greater absorption at the systemic redshift of the galaxy. Finally, we detect outflows in 49% of our LRIS sample and 30% in the KMOS sample, and find no significant correlation between outflow detection and inclination. These results may indicate that outflows are not collimated and that H$\alpha$ outflows have a lower covering fraction than low-ionization interstellar absorption lines. Additionally, these tracers may be sensitive to different physical scales of outflow activity. A larger sample size with a wider dynamic range in galaxy properties is needed to further test this picture.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Ly$\alpha$ Emission in Star Forming Galaxies at $6.5\lesssim z\lesssim13$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of JWST Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy of $z\gtrsim6.5$ galaxies, using observations in the public archive covering galaxies in four independent fields (GOODS-N, GOODS-S, Abell 2744, EGS). We measure Ly$\alpha$ emission line properties for a sample of $210$ $z\simeq6.5-13$ galaxies, with redshifts confirmed independently of Ly$\alpha$ in all cases. We present $3$ new detections of Ly$\alpha$ emission in JWST spectra, including a large equivalent width (EW $=143\ \r{A}$) Ly$\alpha$ emitter with strong CIV emission (EW $=21\ \r{A}$) at $z=7.1$ in GOODS-N. We measure the redshift-dependent Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution across our sample. We find that strong Ly$\alpha$ emission (EW $&gt;25\ \r{A}$) becomes increasingly rare at earlier epochs, suggesting that the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ photons decreases by $4\times$ between $z\simeq5$ and $z\simeq9$. We describe potential implications for the IGM neutral fraction. There is significant field to field variance in the Ly$\alpha$ emitter fraction. In contrast to the three other fields, the EGS shows no evidence for reduced transmission of Ly$\alpha$ photons at $z\simeq7-8$, suggesting a significantly ionized sightline may be present in the field. We use available NIRCam grism observations from the FRESCO survey to characterize overdensities on large scales around known Ly$\alpha$ emitters in the GOODS fields. The strongest overdensities appear linked with extremely strong Ly$\alpha$ detections (EW $&gt;50\ \r{A}$) in most cases. Future Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy with JWST has the potential to constrain the size of ionized regions around early galaxy overdensities, providing a new probe of the reionization process.</description>

      <title>Assessing realistic binding energies of some essential interstellar radicals with amorphous solid water. A fully quantum chemical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of laboratory data, state-of-the-art quantum chemical approaches can provide estimates of the binding energy (BE) of interstellar species with grains. Without BE values, contemporary astrochemical models are compelled to utilize wild guesses, often delivering misleading information. Here, we employed a fully quantum chemical approach to estimate the BE of seven diatomic radicals - CH, NH, OH, SH, CN, NS, and NO - that play a crucial role in shaping the interstellar chemical composition, using a suitable amorphous solid water model as a substrate since water is the principal constituent of interstellar ice in dense and shielded regions. While the BEs are compatible with physisorption, the binding of CH in some sites shows chemisorption, in which a chemical bond to an oxygen atom of a water molecule is formed. While no structural change has been observed for the CN radical, it is believed that the formation of a hemibonded system between the outer layer of the water cluster and the radical is the reason for the unusually large BE in one of the binding sites considered in our study. A significantly lower BE for NO, consistent with recent calculations, is obtained, which helps explain the recently observed HONO/NH$_2$OH and HONO/HNO ratios in the low-mass hot corino IRAS 16293-2422 B with chemical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of three pulsars in the Globular Cluster (GC) M15 (NGC 7078) by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). PSR J2129+1210J (M15J) is a millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 11.84 ms and a dispersion measure of 66.68 pc cm-3. Both PSR J2129+1210K and L (M15K and L) are long-period pulsars with spin periods of 1928 ms and 3961 ms, respectively. M15L is the GC pulsar with the longest spin period known. The timing solutions of M15A to M15H are updated. As predicted by Ridolfi et al.(2018), the flux density of M15C keeps decreasing and the latest detection in our dataset was on December 20th, 2022. We have also detected M15I's signal for the first time since its discovery. Current timing suggests that it is an isolated pulsar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a combined strong and weak gravitational-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404 ($z=0.545$, MACS J1423 hereafter), one of the most dynamically relaxed and massive cool-core clusters discovered in the MAssive Cluster Survey at $z&gt;0.5$. We combine high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the F606W, F814W, and F160W pass-bands with spectroscopic observations taken as part of the KALEIDOSCOPE survey with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer mounted on the Very Large Telescope. Our strong lensing analysis of the mass distribution in the cluster core is constrained by four multiple-image systems (17 individual images) within redshift range $1.779&lt;z&lt;2.840$. Our weak-lensing analysis of the cluster outskirts, confined to the HST field of view, is based on a background galaxy catalogue with a density of 57 gal.arcmin$^{-2}$. We measure a projected mass of M($\textrm{R}&lt;200$ kpc) = (1.6 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\rm\odot}$ from our strong-lensing model, and a projected mass of M($\textrm{R}&lt;640$ kpc) = (6.6 $\pm$ 0.6) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\rm\odot}$ when combining with our the weak-lensing constraints. Our analysis of the cluster mass distribution yields no evidence of substructures, confirming the dynamically relaxed state of MACS J1423. Our work sets the stage for future analysis of MACS J1423 in the upcoming Canadian Near Infrared Imager and Stiltless Spectrograph Unbiased Cluster Survey for the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>
