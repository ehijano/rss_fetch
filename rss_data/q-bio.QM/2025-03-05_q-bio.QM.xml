      <title>dyAb: Flow Matching for Flexible Antibody Design with AlphaFold-driven Pre-binding Antigen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of therapeutic antibodies heavily relies on accurate predictions of how antigens will interact with antibodies. Existing computational methods in antibody design often overlook crucial conformational changes that antigens undergo during the binding process, significantly impacting the reliability of the resulting antibodies. To bridge this gap, we introduce dyAb, a flexible framework that incorporates AlphaFold2-driven predictions to model pre-binding antigen structures and specifically addresses the dynamic nature of antigen conformation changes. Our dyAb model leverages a unique combination of coarse-grained interface alignment and fine-grained flow matching techniques to simulate the interaction dynamics and structural evolution of the antigen-antibody complex, providing a realistic representation of the binding process. Extensive experiments show that dyAb significantly outperforms existing models in antibody design involving changing antigen conformations. These results highlight dyAb's potential to streamline the design process for therapeutic antibodies, promising more efficient development cycles and improved outcomes in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction of amino acid content in live black soldier fly larvae using near infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae are emerging as a sustainable protein source for animal feed and human nutrition. Ensuring consistent amino acid composition is crucial for quality control, necessitating rapid, non-destructive assessment methods, particularly for selective breeding. This study validates near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy with partial least squares (PLS) regression as a reliable tool for predicting free amino acid (FAA) profiles in live larvae. Using a FOSS DS2500 spectrometer (400-2500 nm), 204 live larval samples reared on 17 diets with varying protein (2.3-89.8 percent) and sugar (8.5-96.0 percent) levels were scanned, followed by FAA extraction. Alanine (6.50 +/- 3.52 mg/g) and proline (5.61 +/- 4.45 mg/g) were the most abundant FAAs, with key NIR absorption bands at 1670-1786 nm and 2300-2366 nm enabling accurate predictions. PLS models showed strong predictive power for individual FAAs (e.g., glutamate: R^2 = 0.88; asparagine: R^2 = 0.78; alanine: R^2 = 0.65) and total FAAs (R^2 = 0.64). These results highlight NIR's potential for real-time quality control and phenotyping in BSF production and breeding.</description>

      <title>Measurement noise scaling laws for cellular representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning scaling laws predict how performance improves with increased model and dataset size. Here we identify measurement noise in data as another performance scaling axis, governed by a distinct logarithmic law. We focus on representation learning models of biological single cell genomic data, where a dominant source of measurement noise is due to molecular undersampling. We introduce an information-theoretic metric for cellular representation model quality, and find that it scales with sampling depth. A single quantitative relationship holds across several model types and across several datasets. We show that the analytical form of this relationship can be derived from a simple Gaussian noise model, which in turn provides an intuitive interpretation for the scaling law. Finally, we show that the same relationship emerges in image classification models with respect to two types of imaging noise, suggesting that measurement noise scaling may be a general phenomenon. Scaling with noise can serve as a guide in generating and curating data for deep learning models, particularly in fields where measurement quality can vary dramatically between datasets.</description>

      <title>Multimodal AI predicts clinical outcomes of drug combinations from preclinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations. Current models rely on structural or target-based features to identify high-efficacy, low-toxicity drug combinations. However, these approaches fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically-relevant predictions. Here, we introduce MADRIGAL, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. MADRIGAL uses a transformer bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference--a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of anticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It identifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts resmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with the most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by integrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy of personalized drug combinations. Integrating MADRIGAL with a large language model allows users to describe clinical outcomes in natural language, improving safety assessment by identifying potential adverse interactions and toxicity risks. MADRIGAL provides a multimodal approach for designing combination therapies with improved predictive accuracy and clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>Unlocking tropical forest complexity: How tree assemblages in secondary forests boost biodiversity conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secondary forests now dominate tropical landscapes and play a crucial role in achieving COP15 conservation objectives. This study develops a replicable national approach to identifying and characterising forest ecosystems, with a focus on the role of secondary forests. We hypothesised that dominant tree species in the forest canopy serve as reliable indicators for delineating forest ecosystems and untangling biodiversity complexity. Using national inventories, we identified in situ clusters through hierarchical clustering based on dominant species abundance dissimilarity, determined using the Importance Variable Index. These clusters were characterised by analysing species assemblages and their interactions. We then applied object-oriented Random Forest modelling, segmenting the national forest cover using NDVI to identify the forest ecosystems derived from in situ clusters. Freely available spectral (Sentinel-2) and environmental data were used in the model to delineate and characterise key forest ecosystems. We finished with an assessment of distribution of secondary and old-growth forests within ecosystems. In Costa Rica, 495 dominant tree species defined 10 in situ clusters, with 7 main clusters successfully modelled. The modelling (F1-score: 0.73, macro F1-score: 0.58) and species-based characterisation highlighted the main ecological trends of these ecosystems, which are distinguished by specific species dominance, topography, climate, and vegetation dynamics, aligning with local forest classifications. The analysis of secondary forest distribution provided an initial assessment of ecosystem vulnerability by evaluating their role in forest maintenance and dynamics. This approach also underscored the major challenge of in situ data acquisition</description>

      <title>TReND: Transformer derived features and Regularized NMF for neonatal functional network Delineation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise parcellation of functional networks (FNs) of early developing human brain is the fundamental basis for identifying biomarker of developmental disorders and understanding functional development. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) enables in vivo exploration of functional changes, but adult FN parcellations cannot be directly applied to the neonates due to incomplete network maturation. No standardized neonatal functional atlas is currently available. To solve this fundamental issue, we propose TReND, a novel and fully automated self-supervised transformer-autoencoder framework that integrates regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) to unveil the FNs in neonates. TReND effectively disentangles spatiotemporal features in voxel-wise rs-fMRI data. The framework integrates confidence-adaptive masks into transformer self-attention layers to mitigate noise influence. A self supervised decoder acts as a regulator to refine the encoder's latent embeddings, which serve as reliable temporal features. For spatial coherence, we incorporate brain surface-based geodesic distances as spatial encodings along with functional connectivity from temporal features. The TReND clustering approach processes these features under sparsity and smoothness constraints, producing robust and biologically plausible parcellations. We extensively validated our TReND framework on three different rs-fMRI datasets: simulated, dHCP and HCP-YA against comparable traditional feature extraction and clustering techniques. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the TReND framework in the delineation of neonate FNs with significantly better spatial contiguity and functional homogeneity. Collectively, we established TReND, a novel and robust framework, for neonatal FN delineation. TReND-derived neonatal FNs could serve as a neonatal functional atlas for perinatal populations in health and disease.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Sequential Information of General Lab-test Results and Diagnoses History for Differential Diagnosis of Dementia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) faces multiple data-related challenges, including high variability in patient data, limited access to specialized diagnostic tests, and overreliance on single-type indicators. These challenges are exacerbated by the progressive nature of AD, where subtle pathophysiological changes often precede clinical symptoms by decades. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach that takes advantage of routinely collected general laboratory test histories for the early detection and differential diagnosis of AD. By modeling lab test sequences as "sentences", we apply word embedding techniques to capture latent relationships between tests and employ deep time series models, including long-short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to model temporal patterns in patient records. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves diagnostic accuracy and enables scalable and costeffective AD screening in diverse clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Spatial Analysis of Neuromuscular Junctions Activation in Three-Dimensional Histology-based Muscle Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Histology has long been a foundational technique for studying anatomical structures through tissue slicing. Advances in computational methods now enable three dimensional (3D) reconstruction of organs from histology images, enhancing the analysis of structural and functional features. Here, we present a novel multimodal computational method to reconstruct rodent muscles in 3D using classical image processing and data analysis techniques, analyze their structural features and correlate them to previously recorded electrophysiological data. The algorithm analyzes spatial distribution patterns of features identified through histological staining, normalizing them across multiple samples. Further, the algorithm successfully correlates spatial patterns with high density epimysial ElectroMyoGraphy (hdEMG) recordings, providing a multimodal perspective on neuromuscular dynamics, linking spatial and electrophysiological information. The code was validated by looking at the distribution of NeuroMuscular Junctions (NMJs) in naive soleus muscles and compared the distributions and patterns observed with ones observed in previous literature. Our results showed consistency with the expected results, validating our method for features and pattern recognition. The multimodal aspect was shown in a naive soleus muscle, where a strong correlation was found between motor unit locations derived via hdEMG, and NMJ locations obtained from histology, highlighting their spatial relationship. This multimodal analysis tool integrates 3D structural data with electrophysiological activity, opening new avenues in muscle diagnostics, regenerative medicine, and personalized therapies where spatial insights could one day predict electrophysiological behavior or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Brain states analysis of EEG predicts multiple sclerosis and mirrors disease duration and burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.</description>

      <title>Improving Genomic Prediction using High-dimensional Secondary Phenotypes: the Genetic Latent Factor Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decreasing costs and new technologies have led to an increase in the amount of data available to plant breeding programs. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms routinely generate high-dimensional datasets of secondary features that may be used to improve genomic prediction accuracy. However, integration of these data comes with challenges such as multicollinearity, parameter estimation in $p &gt; n$ settings, and the computational complexity of many standard approaches. Several methods have emerged to analyze such data, but interpretation of model parameters often remains challenging. We propose genetic latent factor best linear unbiased prediction (glfBLUP), a prediction pipeline that reduces the dimensionality of the original secondary HTP data using generative factor analysis. In short, glfBLUP uses redundancy filtered and regularized genetic and residual correlation matrices to fit a maximum likelihood factor model and estimate genetic latent factor scores. These latent factors are subsequently used in multi-trait genomic prediction. Our approach performs better than alternatives in extensive simulations and a real-world application, while producing easily interpretable and biologically relevant parameters. We discuss several possible extensions and highlight glfBLUP as the basis for a flexible and modular multi-trait genomic prediction framework.</description>
