      <title>Diamond principles and Tukey-top ultrafilters on a countable set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two types of guessing principles for ultrafilter ($\diamondsuit^{-}_{\lambda}(U), \ \diamondsuit^p_\lambda(U)$) on $\omega$ which form subclasses of Tukey-top ultrafilters, and construct such ultrafilters in $ZFC$. These constructions are essentially different from Isbell's construction \cite{Isbell65} of Tukey-top ultrafilters. We prove using the Borel-Cantelli Lemma that full guessing is not possible and rule out several stronger guessing principles e.g. we prove that no Dodd-sound ultrafilters exist on $\omega$. We then apply these guessing principles to force a $q$-point which is Tukey-top (answering a question from \cite{Benhanou/Dobrinen23}), and prove that the class of ultrafilters which satisfy $\neg\diamondsuit^{-}_\lambda$ is closed under Fubini sum. Finally, we show that $\diamondsuit^{-}_\lambda$ and $\diamondsuit^p_\lambda$ can be separated.</description>

      <title>Diamond on Kurepa trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new weak variation of diamond that is meant to only guess the branches of a Kurepa tree. We demonstrate that this variation is considerably weaker than diamond by proving it is compatible with Martin's axiom. We then prove that this principle is nontrivial by showing it may consistently fail.</description>

      <title>Interpolant Existence is Undecidable for Two-Variable First-Order Logic with Two Equivalence Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpolant existence problem (IEP) for a logic L is to decide, given formulas P and Q, whether there exists a formula I, built from the shared symbols of P and Q, such that P entails I and I entails Q in L. If L enjoys the Craig interpolation property (CIP), then the IEP reduces to validity in L. Recently, the IEP has been studied for logics without the CIP. The results obtained so far indicate that even though the IEP can be computationally harder than validity, it is decidable when L is decidable. Here, we give the first examples of decidable fragments of first-order logic for which the IEP is undecidable. Namely, we show that the IEP is undecidable for the two-variable fragment with two equivalence relations and for the two-variable guarded fragment with individual constants and two equivalence relations. We also determine the corresponding decidable Boolean description logics for which the IEP is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Universally defining subrings in function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that all rings of $S$-integers are universally definable in function fields in one variable over certain ground fields including global and non-archimedean local fields. That is, we show that the complement of such a ring of $S$-integers is always a diophantine set. As a technical tool, we use a reciprocity exact sequence for quadratic Witt groups in function fields over almost arbitrary base fields (of any characteristic), which is new and of potentially independent interest.</description>

      <title>A minimalist two-level foundation for constructive mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2774</link>
      <description>arXiv:0811.2774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a two-level theory to formalize constructive mathematics as advocated in a previous paper with G. Sambin. One level is given by an intensional type theory, called Minimal type theory. This theory extends the set-theoretic version introduced in the mentioned paper with collections. The other level is given by an extensional set theory which is interpreted in the first one by means of a quotient model. This two-level theory has two main features: it is minimal among the most relevant foundations for constructive mathematics; it is constructive thanks to the way the extensional level is linked to the intensional one which fulfills the "proofs-as-programs" paradigm and acts as a programming language.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Pfaffian in bounded arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalize algorithms computing Pfaffian in the theory of bounded arithmetic for sharpL which is based on Berkowitz algorithm for the determinant. We also prove relations among Pfaffian properties. Furthermore, we give an algorithm for Pfaffian pairs as well.</description>
