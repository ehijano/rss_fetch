      <title>Machine learning and economic forecasting: the role of international trade networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the effects of de-globalization trends on international trade networks and their role in improving forecasts for economic growth. Using section-level trade data from nearly 200 countries from 2010 to 2022, we identify significant shifts in the network topology driven by rising trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis highlights key global players through centrality rankings, with the United States, China, and Germany maintaining consistent dominance. Using a horse race of supervised regressors, we find that network topology descriptors evaluated from section-specific trade networks substantially enhance the quality of a country's GDP growth forecast. We also find that non-linear models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, outperform traditional linear models used in the economics literature. Using SHAP values to interpret these non-linear model's predictions, we find that about half of most important features originate from the network descriptors, underscoring their vital role in refining forecasts. Moreover, this study emphasizes the significance of recent economic performance, population growth, and the primary sector's influence in shaping economic growth predictions, offering novel insights into the intricacies of economic growth forecasting.</description>

      <title>Reference Model Based Learning in Expectation Formation: Experimental Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do people form expectations about future prices in financial markets? One of the dominant learning rules that explains the forecasting behavior is the Adaptive Expectation Rule (ADA), which suggests that people adjust their predictions by adapting to the most recent prediction error at a constant weight. However, this rule also implies that they will continually learn and adapt until the prediction error is zero, which contradicts recent experimental evidence showing that people usually stop learning long before reaching zero prediction error. A more recent learning rule, Reference Model Based Learning (RMBL), extends and generalizes ADA, hypothesizing that: i) People apply ADA but dynamically adjust the adaptive coefficient with regards to the auto-correlation of the prediction error in the most recent two periods; ii) Meanwhile, they also utilize a satisficing rule so that people would only adjust their adaptive coefficient when the prediction error is higher than their anticipation. This paper utilizes a rich set of experimental data with observations of 41,490 predictions from 801 subjects from the Learning-to-Forecast Experiments (LtFEs), i.e., the experiment that has been used to study expectation formation. Our results concludes that RMBL fits better than ADA in all the experiments.</description>

      <title>ge_gravity2: a command for solving universal gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm for computing counterfactual trade flows, prices, output, and welfare in a large class of general equilibrium trade models. We introduce a command called ge_gravity2 that allows users to perform these computations in Stata. This command extends the existing ge_gravity command by allowing users to compute the general equilibrium effects of changes in trade policy in positive supply elasticity models. It can be used to solve any model that falls into the class of universal gravity models as defined by Allen, Arkolakis, and Takahashi [Universal Gravity, Journal of Political Economy, 128(2), 2020, 393-433].</description>

      <title>Belief Bias Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified theoretical model to identify and test a comprehensive set of probabilistic updating biases within a single framework. The model achieves separate identification by focusing on the updating of belief distributions, rather than classic point-belief measurements. Testing the model in a laboratory experiment reveals significant heterogeneity at the individual level: All tested biases are present, and each participant exhibits at least one identifiable bias. Notably, motivated-belief biases (optimism and pessimism) and sequence-related biases (gambler's fallacy and hot hand fallacy) are identified as key drivers of biased inference. Moreover, at the population level, base rate neglect emerges as a persistent influence. This study contributes to the belief-updating literature by providing a methodological toolkit for researchers examining links between different conflicting biases, or exploring connections between updating biases and other behavioural phenomena.</description>

      <title>Has Anti-corruption Efforts lowered Enterprises Innovation Efficiency? -An Empirical Analysis from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study adopts the fixed effects panel model and provincial panel data on anticorruption and the innovation efficiency of high-level technology and new technology enterprises in China from 2005 to 2014, to estimate the effects of the anticorruption movement on the innovation efficiency of enterprises at different corruption levels. The empirical results show that anticorruption is positively correlated with the innovation efficiency of enterprises; however, the correlation is differentiated according to different corruption levels and business natures. At a high level of corruption, anticorruption has positive impacts on enterprises' innovation; at a low level of corruption, it negatively affects innovation efficiency. However, anticorruption has negative effects on the innovation efficiency of state-owned enterprises at both high and low corruption levels; for nonstate-owned enterprises, its effects are positive at a high corruption level and negative at a low corruption level. The effects remain the same across different regions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying fair income distribution in Thailand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a vast concern about high income inequality in Thailand as opposed to empirical findings around the world showing people's preference for fair income inequality over unfair income equality, it is therefore important to examine whether inequality in income distribution in Thailand over the past three decades is fair, and what fair inequality in income distribution in Thailand should be. To quantitatively measure fair income distribution, this study employs the fairness benchmarks that are derived from the distributions of athletes' salaries in professional sports which satisfy the concepts of distributive justice and procedural justice, the no-envy principle of fair allocation, and the general consensus or the international norm criterion of a meaningful benchmark. By using the data on quintile income shares and the income Gini index of Thailand from the National Social and Economic Development Council, this study finds that, throughout the period from 1988 to 2021, the Thai income earners in the bottom 20%, the second 20%, and the top 20% receive income shares more than the fair shares whereas those in the third 20% and the fourth 20% receive income shares less than the fair shares. Provided that there are infinite combinations of quintile income shares that can have the same value of income Gini index but only one of them is regarded as fair, this study demonstrates the use of fairness benchmarks as a practical guideline for designing policies with an aim to achieve fair income distribution in Thailand. Moreover, a comparative analysis is conducted by employing the method for estimating optimal (fair) income distribution representing feasible income equality in order to provide an alternative recommendation on what optimal (fair) income distribution characterizing feasible income equality in Thailand should be.</description>

      <title>Strategic Informed Trading and the Value of Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a market of risky financial assets where the participants are an informed trader, a mass of uniformed traders and noisy liquidity providers. We prove the existence of a market-clearing equilibrium when the insider internalizes her power to impact prices. In the price-impact equilibrium the insider strategically reveals a noisier (compared to when the insider takes prices as given) signal, and prices are less reactive to the publicly available information. In contrast to the related literature, we show that in the price-impact equilibrium, the insider's ex-ante welfare monotonically increases in the signal precision. This clarifies when a trader with market power is motivated to both obtain and refine her private information. Furthermore, even though the uniformed traders act as price-takers, the effect of price impact is ex-ante welfare improving for them. By contrast, internalization of price impact may reduce insider ex-ante welfare. This happens provided the insider is sufficiently risk averse and the uninformed traders are sufficiently risk tolerant.</description>

      <title>Business models for the simulation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation hypothesis suggests that we live in a computer simulation. That notion has attracted significant scholarly and popular interest. This article explores the simulation hypothesis from a business perspective. Due to the lack of a name for a universe consistent with the simulation hypothesis, we propose the term simuverse. We argue that if we live in a simulation, there must be a business justification. Therefore, we ask: If we live in a simuverse, what is its business model? We identify and explore business model scenarios, such as simuverse as a project, service, or platform. We also explore business model pathways and risk management issues. The article contributes to the simulation hypothesis literature and is the first to provide a business model perspective on the simulation hypothesis. The article discusses theoretical and practical implications and identifies opportunities for future research related to sustainability, digital transformation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to estimate the market value of pharmaceutical drugs. Our approach combines an event study with a model of discounted cash flows and uses stock market responses to drug development announcements to infer the values. We estimate that, on average, a successful drug is valued at \$1.62 billion, and its value at the discovery stage is \$64.3 million, with substantial heterogeneity across major diseases. Leveraging these estimates, we also determine the average drug development costs at various stages. Furthermore, we explore applying our estimates to design policies that support drug development through drug buyouts and cost-sharing agreements.</description>

      <title>Motives for Delegating Financial Decisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why do some investors delegate financial decisions to supposed experts? We report a laboratory experiment designed to disentangle four possible motives. Almost 600 investors drawn from the Prolific subject pool choose whether or not to delegate a real-stakes choice among lotteries to a previous investor (an ``expert'') after seeing information on the performance of several available experts. We find that a surprisingly large fraction of investors delegate even trivial choice tasks, suggesting a major role for the blame shifting motive. A larger fraction of investors delegate our more complex tasks, suggesting that decision costs play a role for some investors. Some investors who delegate choose a low quality expert with high earnings, suggesting a role for chasing past performance. We find no evidence for a fourth possible motive, that delegation makes risk more acceptable.</description>

      <title>Odd period cycles and ergodic properties in price dynamics for an exchange economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper (Sections 1-4), we study a standard exchange economy model with Cobb-Douglas type consumers and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an odd period cycle in the Walras-Samuelson (tatonnement) price adjustment process. We also give a sufficient condition for a price to be eventually attracted to a chaotic region. In the second part (Sections 5 and 6), we investigate ergodic properties of the price dynamics showing that the existence of chaos is not necessarily bad. (The future is still predictable on average.) Moreover, supported by a celebrated work of Avila et al. (Invent. Math., 2003), we conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate a relationship between the ergodic sum (of prices) and the speed of price adjustment. We believe that our methods in this paper can be used to analyse many other chaotic economic models.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Global Emission Permit Prices and Regional Social Cost of Carbon under Noncooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a dynamic multi-region model of climate and economy with emission permit trading among 12 aggregated regions in the world. We solve for the dynamic Nash equilibrium under noncooperation, wherein each region adheres to the emission cap constraints following commitments that were first outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement and updated in subsequent years. Our model shows that the emission permit price reaches $811 per ton of carbon by 2050. We demonstrate that a regional carbon tax is complementary to the global cap-and-trade system, and the optimal regional carbon tax is equal to the difference between the regional marginal abatement cost and the permit price.</description>

      <title>Technological Shocks and Algorithmic Decision Aids in Credence Goods Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In credence goods markets such as health care or repair services, consumers rely on experts with superior information to adequately diagnose and treat them. Experts, however, are constrained in their diagnostic abilities, which hurts market efficiency and consumer welfare. Technological breakthroughs that substitute or complement expert judgments have the potential to alleviate consumer mistreatment. This article studies how competitive experts adopt novel diagnostic technologies when skills are heterogeneously distributed and obfuscated to consumers. We differentiate between novel technologies that increase expert abilities, and algorithmic decision aids that complement expert judgments, but do not affect an expert's personal diagnostic precision. We show that high-ability experts may be incentivized to forego the decision aid in order to escape a pooling equilibrium by differentiating themselves from low-ability experts. Results from an online experiment support our hypothesis, showing that high-ability experts are significantly less likely than low-ability experts to invest into an algorithmic decision aid. Furthermore, we document pervasive under-investments, and no effect on expert honesty.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT Can Predict the Future when it Tells Stories Set in the Future About the Past</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates whether OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 can accurately forecast future events using two distinct prompting strategies. To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, we take advantage of the fact that the training data at the time of experiment stopped at September 2021, and ask about events that happened in 2022 using ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4. We employed two prompting strategies: direct prediction and what we call future narratives which ask ChatGPT to tell fictional stories set in the future with characters that share events that have happened to them, but after ChatGPT's training data had been collected. Concentrating on events in 2022, we prompted ChatGPT to engage in storytelling, particularly within economic contexts. After analyzing 100 prompts, we discovered that future narrative prompts significantly enhanced ChatGPT-4's forecasting accuracy. This was especially evident in its predictions of major Academy Award winners as well as economic trends, the latter inferred from scenarios where the model impersonated public figures like the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell. These findings indicate that narrative prompts leverage the models' capacity for hallucinatory narrative construction, facilitating more effective data synthesis and extrapolation than straightforward predictions. Our research reveals new aspects of LLMs' predictive capabilities and suggests potential future applications in analytical contexts.</description>
