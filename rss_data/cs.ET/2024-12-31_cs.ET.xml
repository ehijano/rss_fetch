      <title>Modeling and Analysis of SCFA-Driven Vagus Nerve Signaling in the Gut-Brain Axis via Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication paradigm that utilizes molecules to transfer information and offers a robust framework for understanding biological signaling systems. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end MC framework for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-driven vagus nerve signaling within the gut-brain axis (GBA) to enhance our understanding of gut-brain communication mechanisms. SCFA molecules, produced by gut microbiota, serve as important biomarkers in physiological and psychological processes, including neurodegenerative and mental health disorders. The developed end-to-end model integrates SCFA binding to vagal afferent fibers, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated calcium signaling, and Hodgkin-Huxley-based action potential generation into a comprehensive vagus nerve signaling mechanism through GBA. Information-theoretic metrics such as mutual information and delay are used to evaluate the efficiency of this SCFA-driven signaling pathway model. Simulations demonstrate how molecular inputs translate into neural outputs, highlighting critical aspects that govern gut-brain communication. In this work, the integration of SCFA-driven signaling into the MC framework provides a novel perspective on gut-brain communication and paves the way for the development of innovative therapeutic advancements targeting neurological and psychiatric disorders.</description>

      <title>Multi Ratio Shift Keying (MRSK) for Molecullar Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) leverages the power of diffusion to transmit molecules from a transmitter to a receiver. A wide variety of modulation techniques based on molecule concentration, type, and release time have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel modulation technique that encodes the information into the relative concentrations of multiple molecules called Multi Ratio Shift Keying (MRSK) designed for diffusion-based MC without drift. We show that leveraging all possible ratios in a set of molecules can help mitigate the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) and provide a flexible communication channel. To evaluate the performance of the MRSK, we develop a mathematical framework for studying the statistics of the ratio of random variables, focusing on noncentral Gaussian distributions. We then assess MRSK performance both analytically and through particle-based simulations under various channel conditions, identifying potential sources of error in our system model. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of commonly used modulation schemes in the literature based on bit error rate (BER). The results show that MRSK significantly outperforms all traditional modulation schemes considered in this study in terms of BER. MRSK offers a promising, flexible, and more reliable communication method for the future of the MC paradigm.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient LoRaWAN in LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LPWAN service's inexpensive cost and long range capabilities make it a promising addition and countless satellite companies have started taking advantage of this technology to connect IoT users across the globe. However, LEO satellites have the unique challenge of using rechargeable batteries and green solar energy to power their components. LPWAN technology is not optimized to maximize battery lifespan of network nodes. By incorporating a MAC protocol that maximizes node the battery lifespan across the network, we can reduce battery waste and usage of scarce Earth resources to develop satellite batteries.</description>

      <title>Design of an improved microstrip antenna operating at a frequency band of 28GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of an improved microstrip antenna operating in the 28 GHz frequency spectrum is the main goal of this work. The design used a Roger RT 5880 LZ substrate with a thickness and permittivity of 0.762mm and 1.96, respectively. The antenna was simulated in CST Microwave Studio. As the antenna feed, a quarter-wave transformer was used to provide an impedance match of 50 ohms. To improve the antenna's performance, a Ushaped element was added to the ground plane. The antenna resonated at 28 GHz frequency, according to simulation data, with a return loss of -21.4 dB, VSWR of 1.18, bandwidth of 2.026 GHz, and gain of 8.19 dB. The proposed antenna exhibits a performance improvement in terms of gain and bandwidth due to the addition of U-shaped element when benchmarked with existing designs in the literature work</description>

      <title>Cool, But What About Oracles? An Oracle-Based Perspective on Blockchain Integration in the Accounting Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bitcoin Network is a sophisticated accounting system that allows its underlying cryptocurrency to be trusted even in the absence of a reliable financial authority. Given its undeniable success, the technology, generally referred to as blockchain, has also been proposed as a means to improve legacy accounting systems. Accounting for real-world data, however, requires the intervention of a third party known as an Oracle, which, having not the same characteristics as a blockchain, could potentially reduce the expected integration benefit. Through a systematic review of the literature, this study aims to investigate whether the papers concerning blockchain integration in accounting consider and address the limitations posed by oracles. A broad overview of the limitations that emerged in the literature is provided and distinguished according to the specific accounting integration. Results support the view that although research on the subject counts numerous articles, actual studies considering oracle limitations are lacking. Interestingly, despite the scarce production of papers addressing oracles in various accounting sectors, reporting for ESG already shows interesting workarounds for oracle limitations, with permissioned chains envisioned as a valid support for the safe storage of sustainability data.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Mobile Edge Computing via Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</description>

      <title>Analog Alchemy: Neural Computation with In-Memory Inference, Learning and Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As neural computation is revolutionizing the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), rethinking the ideal neural hardware is becoming the next frontier. Fast and reliable von Neumann architecture has been the hosting platform for neural computation. Although capable, its separation of memory and computation creates the bottleneck for the energy efficiency of neural computation, contrasting the biological brain. The question remains: how can we efficiently combine memory and computation, while exploiting the physics of the substrate, to build intelligent systems? In this thesis, I explore an alternative way with memristive devices for neural computation, where the unique physical dynamics of the devices are used for inference, learning and routing. Guided by the principles of gradient-based learning, we selected functions that need to be materialized, and analyzed connectomics principles for efficient wiring. Despite non-idealities and noise inherent in analog physics, I will provide hardware evidence of adaptability of local learning to memristive substrates, new material stacks and circuit blocks that aid in solving the credit assignment problem and efficient routing between analog crossbars for scalable architectures.</description>

      <title>Potential Enabling Technologies for 7G Networks: Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every new generation of mobile networks brings significant advances in two segments, enhancement of the network parameters within the legacy technologies and introduction of new technologies enabling new paradigms in designing the networks. In the first class of enhancements the effort is to increase data rates, improve energy efficiency, enhance connectivity, reduce data transmission latency etc. In the second class of innovations for 6G and 7G, we anticipate focus on optimum integration of advanced ML and AI in general, and quantum computing with the continuous interest in the satellite networks for optimal quantum key distribution . By introducing quantum technology 7G will be able to speed up computing processes in the net, enhance network security as well as to enable distributed QC, which is a new paradigm in computer sciences.
  Using advanced networks as a basic ingredient of inter system integration, here we focus only on the second segment of anticipated innovations in networking and present a survey of the subset of potential technology enablers for the above concept with special emphasis on the inter dependency of the solutions chosen in different segments of the network. In Section II, we present several anticipated 6G/7G (system of systems type) network optimization examples resulting in a new paradigm of network optimization indicating a need for quantum computing and quantum computing based optimization algorithms. In Section III we survey work on quantum cryptography and QKD.</description>

      <title>Accurate modeling of continuous-time SAT solvers in SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in employing dynamical systems as solvers of NP-complete problems. In this paper, we present accurate implementations of two continuous-time dynamical solvers, known in the literature as analog SAT and digital memcomputing, using advanced numerical integration algorithms of SPICE circuit simulators. For this purpose, we have developed Python scripts that convert Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems into electronic circuits representing the analog SAT and digital memcomputing dynamical systems. Our Python scripts process conjunctive normal form (CNF) files and create netlists that can be directly imported into LTspice. We explore the SPICE implementations of analog SAT and digital memcomputing solvers by applying these to a selected set of problems and present some interesting and potentially useful findings related to digital memcomputing and analog SAT. In this work, we also introduce networks of continuous-time solvers with potential applications extending beyond the solution of Boolean satisfiability problems.</description>

      <title>A multiple-circuit approach to quantum resource reduction with application to the quantum lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a multi-circuit quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) algorithm that leverages parallel quantum computing to reduce quantum resource requirements. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient for these computations. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems are based on single quantum circuits and, in many cases, use lattice-based methods. Current quantum devices are adorned with sufficient noise to make large and deep circuits untenable. We introduce a multiple-circuit algorithm for a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) solve of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The method, called QLBM-frugal, aims to create more practical quantum circuits and strategies for differential equation-based problems. The presented method is validated and demonstrated for 2D lid-driven cavity flow. The two-circuit algorithm shows a marked reduction in CNOT gates, which consume the majority of the runtime on quantum devices. Compared to the baseline QLBM technique, a two-circuit strategy shows increasingly large improvements in gate counts as the qubit size, or problem size, increases. For 64 lattice sites, the CNOT count was reduced by 35%, and the gate depth decreased by 16%. This strategy also enables concurrent circuit execution, further halving the seen gate depth.</description>

      <title>Routing and Spectrum Allocation in Broadband Quantum Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single broadband quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing and spectrum allocation scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. As our setting allows separately solving the routing and spectrum allocation problems, we first find an optimal polynomial-time routing algorithm. We then employ max-min fairness criterion for spectrum allocation, which presents an NP-hard problem. Thus, we focus on approximately-optimal schemes. We compare their performance by evaluating the max-min and median number of EPR-pair rates assigned by them, and the associated Jain index. We identify two polynomial-time approximation algorithms that perform well, or better than others under these metrics. We also investigate scalability by analyzing how the network size and connectivity affect performance using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves higher minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and computational resources are considered. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of the source node placement on the performance.</description>
