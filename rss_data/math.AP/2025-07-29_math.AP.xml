      <title>Global strong solutions for the triangular Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto cross-diffusion system in three dimensions and parabolic regularisation for increasing functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of global strong solutions to the triangular Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) cross-diffusion system with Lokta-Volterra reaction terms in three dimensions. A key part is the independent careful study of the parabolic equation $a\partial_t w - \Delta w = f$ with a rough coefficient $a$, homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, and the special assumption $\partial_t w \ge 0$. By the same method, we obtain estimates for solutions to reaction-diffusion systems modelling reversible chemistry.</description>

      <title>Nodal set for the Schr\"odinger equation under a local growth condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the upper bound on the size of the nodal set for a solution $w$ of the Schr\"odinger equation $\Delta w= W\cdot \nabla w+V w$ in an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where the coefficients belong to certain Sobolev spaces. Assuming a local doubling condition for the solution $w$, we establish an upper bound on the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the nodal set, with the bound depending algebraically on the Sobolev norms of $W$ and $V$.</description>

      <title>Pointwise boundary estimates for fully nonlinear elliptic equations with nonzero Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate boundary estimates for the Dirichlet problem for a class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations with general boundary conditions, including nonzero boundary conditions. Given specific structural conditions on the problem, we develop pointwise boundary upper and lower bound estimates for convex solutions based on the subsolution and supersolution method. The global H\"older regularity can be derived as a direct consequence of these pointwise boundary estimates. These results fundamentally hinge on careful descriptions of the convexity properties of both the domains and the functions involved. Moreover, previous results on Monge-Amp\`ere equations with nonzero Dirichlet boundary conditions can be regarded as a special case of our results.</description>

      <title>A further remark on the density estimate for degenerate Allen-Cahn equations: $\Delta_{p}$-type equations for $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{n}{n-1}$ with rough coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short remark on a previous paper \cite{SZ25}, we continue the study of Allen-Cahn equations associated with Ginzburg-Landau energies \begin{equation*}
  J(v,\Omega)=\int_{\Omega}\Big\{F(\nabla v,v,x)+W(v,x)\Big\}dx, \end{equation*} involving a Dirichlet energy $F(\vec{\xi},\tau,x)\sim|\vec{\xi}|^{p}$ and a degenerate double-well potential $W(\tau,x)\sim(1-\tau^{2})^{m}$. In contrast to \cite{SZ25}, we remove all regularity assumptions on the Ginzburg-Landau energy. Then, with further assumptions that $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{n}{n-1}$ and that $W(\tau,x)$ is monotone in $\tau$ on both sides of $0$, we establish a density estimate for the level sets of nontrivial minimizers $|u|\leq1$.</description>

      <title>Mass threshold for global existence in chemotaxis systems with critical flux limitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the flux-limited chemotaxis system, proposed by Kohatsu and Senba~(2025), \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} u_t = \Delta u -\nabla\cdot(u|\nabla v|^{\alpha-2}\nabla v),\\ \:\:0=\Delta v + u,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} posed in the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^N$ for some $N\geq2$, subject to no-flux and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Due to precedents, e.g., Tello (2022) and Winkler (2022), the exponent $\alpha = \frac{N}{N-1}$ is the threshold for finite-time blow-up under symmetry assumptions. We further find that under the framework of radially symmetric solutions, the system with critical flux limitation admits a globally bounded weak solution if and only if initial mass is strictly less than $\omega_N \big(\frac{N^2}{N-1}\big)^{N-1}$, where $\omega_N$ denotes the measure of the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{N-1}$. Asymptotic behaviors are also considered.</description>

      <title>Pohozaev identities for weak solutions of Grushin type p-sub-Laplacian equation via domain variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Pohozaev identities for weak solutions of degenerate elliptic equations involving Grushin type p-sub-Laplacian under only $C^1$-regularity assumption. By using domain variations, we obtain the local Pohozaev identities of translating type and scaling type. As an application, a global Pohozaev identity of scaling type in $\mathbb{R}^{N+l}$ is also derived.</description>

      <title>Stability of oppositely-propagating pair of Hill's spherical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the stability of a pair of Hill's spherical vortices moving away from each other in 3D incompressible axisymmetric Euler equations without swirl. Each vortex in the pair propagates away from its odd-symmetric counterpart, while keeping its vortex profile close to Hill's vortex. This is achieved by analyzing the evolution of the interaction energy of the pair and combining it with the compactness of energy-maximizing sequences in the variational problem concerning Hill's vortex. The key strategy is to confirm that, if the interaction energy is initially small enough, the kinetic energy of each vortex in the pair remains so close to that of a single Hill's vortex for all time that each vortex profile stays close to the energy maximizer: Hill's vortex. An estimate of the propagating speed of each vortex in the pair is also obtained by tracking the center of mass of each vortex. The estimate can be understood as optimal in the sense of the power exponent of the $\varepsilon$--the small perturbation measured in the ($L^1\cap L^2$+impulse) norm--appearing in the error bound cannot be improved.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for a Schr\"odinger equation on the half-line with a Neumann boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove some new Strichartz estimates related to the Cauchy problem for the Bessel operator on the half-line and we establish a fractal version of the Tomas-Stein restriction theorem for the Hankel transform. Then we use the proved Strichartz estimates to show global in time well-posedness for a class of nonlinear $L^2_a$-critical problems, and local in time well-posedness in the sub-critical case.</description>

      <title>Long-term behaviour of the primitive equations with wind-driven boundary conditions: Convergence to the Ekman spiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the long-term behaviour of the 3D incompressible, primitive equations with wind-driven boundary conditions and Coriolis force. We show that every solution converges exponentially fast to the Ekman spiral as $t \to + \infty$. In particular, this implies that the Ekman spiral is the unique equilibrium of the system.</description>

      <title>Refraction laws in temporal media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time dependent Maxwell system in the sense of distributions in the context of temporal interfaces. Just as with spatial interfaces, electromagnetic waves at temporal interfaces scatter and create a transmitted and reflected wave. We provide a rigorous derivation of boundary conditions for the electric and magnetic fields at temporal interfaces with precise assumptions on the material parameters. In turn, we use this to obtain a general Snell's Law at such interfaces. From this, we obtain explicit formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients. Unlike previous works, we do not make any simplifying ansatz on the solution to the Maxwell system, nor do we assume that the fields are smooth. We also consider material parameters which are not necessarily constant on either side of the temporal interface.</description>

      <title>Fractional Trudinger-Moser type inequalities with logarithmic convolution potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the following fractional Trudinger-Moser type inequality with logarithmic convolution potential $$ \sup_{u\in W^{\frac{1}{2},2}_0(I),\|u\|_{W_0^{\frac{1}{2},2}}\leq1}\int_{I} \int_{I} \log \frac{1}{|x-y|} G(u(x))G(u(y)) \, dx \, dy&lt;+\infty,$$ where $G(s)\leq C\frac{e^{\pi s^{2}}}{(1 + |s|)^{\gamma}}~ \forall s\in\mathbb{R}$ with some constant $C&gt;0,\gamma\geq1$, the domain $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded interval. This type of inequality in the entire space $\mathbb{R}$ is also considered. Moreover, we study the existence of corresponding extremal functions.
  In addition, by the moving plane method, we obtain the radial symmetry and radial decreasing property of positive solutions to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimate for discrete Schr\"odinger equation on layered King's grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the sharp \( l^1 \to l^{\infty} \) decay estimate for the discrete Schr\"odinger equation (DS) on the Layered King's Grid (LKG), with a dispersive decay rate of \( \langle t \rangle^{-13/12} \), which is faster than that for $3$-dimensional lattice (\( \langle t \rangle^{-1} \), see \cite{SK05}). This decay estimate enables us to derive the corresponding Strichartz estimate via the standard Keel--Tao argument. Our approach relies on using techniques from Newton polyhedra to analyze singularities.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems for anisotropic $p$-Laplace equations with a semilinear term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Liouville theorems for solutions to the anisotropic $p$-Laplace equation $$-\Delta_p^H u=-\operatorname{div}(a(\nabla u))=f(u),\quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^n,$$ where the semilinear term $f$ may be positive, negative, or sign-changing. When $f$ is positive (negative) and satisfies certain conditions, Serrin's technique is applied to show that every positive supersolution (subsolution) must be constant. For the subcritical case, we use the invariant tensor method to prove nonexistence results for positive solutions. In particular, by applying the differential identity established in the subcritical case to the critical case, we provide a simplified new proof of the classification of positive solutions to the critical case $f(u)=u^{p^*-1}$. For sign-changing solutions, every stable solution or solution that is stable outside a compact set is trivial under certain conditions on $f$.</description>

      <title>Local and global well-posedness for the kinetic derivative NLS on $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local and global well-posedness of the kinetic derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation(KDNLS) on $\mathbb{R}$, described by \[ i\partial_t u + \partial_x^2 u = i\alpha \partial_x (|u|^2 u) + i\beta \partial_x (\mathcal{H} (|u|^2) u), \] where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathcal{H}$ represents the Hilbert transformation. For KDNLS, the $L^2$ norm of a solution is decreasing (resp. increasing, conserved) when $\beta$ is negative (resp. positive, zero). Focusing on the Sobolev spaces $H^2$ and $ H^2 \cap H^{1,1} $, we establish local well-posedness via the energy method combined with gauge transformations to address resonant interactions in both cases of negative and positive $\beta$. For the dissipative case $\beta &lt; 0$, we further demonstrate global well-posedness by deriving an a priori bound in $H^2$.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis models with mixed mechanisms: boundedness in growth-dominated regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a chemotaxis-growth system with nonlinear local and nonlocal reactions and gradient-dependent damping. Under suitable conditions on the system parameters and spatial dimension, we prove that solutions exist globally in time and remain uniformly bounded. Unlike classical cases, when local growth dominates, mass control is not automatic. To address this, we use a two-step approach: first ensuring bounded total mass, then establishing full uniform boundedness. The results highlight how chemotaxis, damping, and nonlocal effects interact to prevent blow-up in structured models.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of singular solutions for semilinear elliptic equations with superlinear source terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the multiplicity of singular solutions for the nonlinear elliptic equation $-\Delta u =f(u)$ near the origin. Applying the classification of nonlinear functions and the transformation, which were developed by the authors, we generalize the multiplicity results known for the concrete model nonlinearity $f(u)=u^p$ with $\frac{N}{N-2}&lt;p&lt;\frac{N+2}{N-2}$. Our result applies to various nonlinearities, such as $f(s)=s^p+s^r$ with $0&lt;r&lt;p$, $f(s)=s^p(\log s)^r$ with $r\in \mathbb{R}$, $f(s)=s^p\exp((\log s)^r)$ with $0&lt;r&lt;1$ and $f(s)=s^p+s^r(\log s)^{\beta}$ with $0&lt;r&lt;p$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$, for $\frac{N}{N-2}&lt;p&lt;\frac{N+2}{N-2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $p$-Laplacian system with Choquard-type nonlinearity $$ \begin{cases}-\Delta_{p} u+(\lambda a+1)|u|^{p-2} u=\frac{1}{\gamma} \left(R_\alpha\ast F(u,v)\right)F_{u}(u, v), \\ -\Delta_{p} v+(\lambda b+1)|v|^{p-2} v=\frac{1}{\gamma} \left(R_\alpha\ast F(u,v)\right)F_{v}(u, v),\end{cases} $$ on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^N$, where $\alpha \in(0,N),\,p\geq 2,\,\gamma&gt; \frac{(N+\alpha)p}{2N},\,\lambda&gt;0$ is a parameter and $R_{\alpha}$ is the Green's function of the discrete fractional Laplacian that behaves as the Riesz potential. Under some assumptions on the functions $a,\,b$ and $F$, we prove the existence and asymptotic behavior of ground state solutions by the method of Nehari manifold.</description>

      <title>Vanishing discount limits for first-order fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations on noncompact domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation $H(x, Du, \lambda u) = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as $\lambda \to 0^+$. Under the assumption that the Aubry set is localized, we employ a variational approach to derive limiting Mather-type measures and formulate a selection principle. Central to our analysis is a modified variational formula that bridges global and local state-constraint solutions, thereby extending localization techniques to the nonlinear framework.</description>

      <title>Viscous-inertial waves on the surface of the Sun: modeling, forward and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework for studying the newly discovered solar inertial oscillations, offering promising new avenues for exploring the Sun's dynamics. Under the assumption of purely toroidal motions, the stream function of the flow satisfies a fourth-order scalar equation governing inertial waves on the rotating Sun. We prove well-posedness of wave solutions under explicit conditions on differential rotation. Moreover, we study the inverse problem of simultaneously reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation parameters from either complete or partial surface observations. To this end, we verify the tangential cone condition, ensuring the convergence of iterative regularization methods. Numerical experiments employing the Nesterov-Landweber iteration confirm robustness of the reconstruction across different observation schemes and noise levels.</description>

      <title>Higher regularity in nonlocal free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the higher regularity in nonlocal free boundary problems posed for general integro-differential operators of order $2s$. Our main result is for the nonlocal one-phase (Bernoulli) problem, for which we establish that $C^{2,\alpha}$ free boundaries are $C^\infty$. This is new even for the fractional Laplacian, as it was only known in case $s=\frac12$. We also establish a general result for overdetermined problems, showing that if the boundary condition is smooth, then so is $\partial\Omega$. Our approach is very robust and works as well for the nonlocal obstacle problem, where it yields a new proof of the higher regularity of free boundaries, completely different from the one in [AbRo20]. In order to prove our results, we need to develop, among other tools, new integration by parts formulas and delicate boundary H\"older estimates for nonlocal equations with (local) Neumann boundary conditions that had not been studied before and are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Deriving sub-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-diffusion equations are used in a large range of applications including fluids, plasma physics and biology. Their mathematical analysis is advanced even if a much larger literature addresses super-diffusions. The goal of this paper is to provide the microscopic mechanism and rigorous derivation of sub-diffusions when the waiting time distribution of particles follows an age-structured equation and jumps occur at each renewal. The major difficulty to recover sub-diffusions, unlike normal diffusions, is that the assumption of long waiting time implies lack of integrability for the age equilibrium. This prevents to establish strong a priori estimates. Here, the Laplace transform plays the role that Fourier transform plays for the more traditional case of fast diffusions.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Degenerate Nonlinear Functionals under Radial Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the minimization of nonlinear functionals in dimension $d\geq 1$ that depend on a degenerate radial weight $w$. Our goal is to prove the existence of minimizers in a suitable functional class here introduced and to establish that the minimizers of such functionals, which exhibit $p$-growth with $1 &lt; p &lt; +\infty$, are radially symmetric. In our analysis, we adopt the approach developed in [Chiad\`o Piat, De Cicco and Melchor Hernandez, NoDEA $2025$, De Cicco and Serra Cassano, ESAIM:COCV $2024$], where $w$ does not satisfy classical assumptions such as doubling or Muckenhoupt conditions. The core of our method relies on proving the validity of a weighted Poincar\'e inequality involving a suitably constructed auxiliary weight.</description>

      <title>Classification of singular limits for free boundary and singularly perturbed elliptic problems: the Dancer-Yan spikes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the singular limits relative to a free boundary problem arising in plasma physics in dimension $d=2$, under suitable natural integral bounds. It turns out that one of the asymptotic behaviors allowed corresponds to the Dancer-Yan spikes (J. London Math. Soc. ({\bf 78}) 2008, 639--662). Interestingly enough, roughly speaking and unlike the higher dimensional case, it is not true that any solution in the limit is a Dancer-Yan spike. Indeed, the spiking structure is more rich and we succeed in a detailed description of the singular behavior by a careful analysis, from local to global, of the tiny difference between the maximum value of the spikes and their ``vanishing level'' defining the free boundary.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and long-time asymptotic behavior of regular solutions in multidimensional thermoelasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a simplified nonlinear thermoelasticity model on two- and three-dimensional tori. A novel functional involving the Fisher information associated with temperature is introduced, extending the previous one-dimensional approach from the first two authors (SIAM J.\ Math.\ Anal.\ \textbf{55} (2023), 7024--7038)) to higher dimensions. Using this functional, we prove global/local existence of unique regular solutions for small/large initial data. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior as time approaches infinity and show that the temperature stabilizes to a constant state, while the displacement naturally decomposes into two distinct components: a divergence-free part oscillating indefinitely according to a homogeneous wave equation and a curl-free part converging to zero. Analogous results for the Lam\'e operator are also stated.</description>

      <title>Convergence of two-scale expansions for elastic heterogeneous plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to prove strong convergence results on the difference between the solution to highly oscillatory problems posed in thin domains and its two-scale expansion. We first consider the case of the linear diffusion equation and establish such results in arbitrary dimensions, by using a straightforward adaptation of the classical arguments used for the homogenization of highly oscillatory problems posed on fixed (non-thin) domains. We next consider the linear elasticity problem, which raises challenging difficulties in its full generality. Under some classical assumptions on the symmetries of the elasticity tensor, the problem can be split into two independent problems, the membrane problem and the bending problem. Focusing on two-dimensional problems, we show that the membrane case can actually be addressed using a careful adaptation of classical arguments. In the bending case, the scheme of the proof used in the membrane and diffusion cases can however not be straightforwardly adapted. In that bending case, we establish the desired strong convergence results by using a different strategy of proof, which seems, up to our knowledge, to be new.</description>

      <title>Regularity of stable solutions to the MEMS problem up to the optimal dimension 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we address the regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations $-\Delta u = f(u)$ with MEMS type nonlinearities. More precisely, we will have $0\leq u \leq 1$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $f:[0,1)\to (0,+\infty)$ blowing up at $u=1$ and nonintegrable near 1. In this context, a solution $u$ is regular if $u&lt;1$ in all $\Omega$ or, equivalently, if $-\Delta u = f(u)&lt;+\infty$ in $\Omega$.
  This paper establishes for the first time interior regularity estimates that are independent of the boundary condition that $u$ may satisfy. Our results hold up to the optimal dimension $n=6$ (there are counterexamples for $n\geq 7$) but require a Crandall-Rabinowitz type assumption on the nonlinearity $f$ when $n\geq 3$. Our main estimate controls the $L^\infty$ norm of $F(u)$ in a ball, where $F$ is a primitive of $f$, by only the $L^1$ norm of $u$ in a larger ball.
  Under the same assumptions, we also give global estimates in dimensions $n\leq 6$ for the Dirichlet problem with vanishing boundary condition, improving previously known results. In dimensions $n\leq 2$, our estimate holds for all nonnegative, nondecreasing, convex nonlinearities which blow up at 1 and are nonintegrable near 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study traveling waves in a coordinate-free model of flame fronts. The flame front is the interface between the burnt and unburnt phases of a gas undergoing combustion. The front therefore moves in a preferred direction, as the unburnt gas is consumed. In the horizontally periodic, vertically unbounded setting, we prove the existence of waves of permanent form which are traveling in the vertical direction. We also compute these waves. The analysis and computation use the framework of traveling waves in the arclength parameterization as previously developed by two of the authors and Wright.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find normalized solutions to the following Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation}\notag \begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u-\frac{\mu}{|x|^2}h(x)u+\lambda u =f(u)\quad\text{in}\quad\mathbb{R}^{N},\\ &amp; u&gt;0,\quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}u^2dx=a^2, \end{aligned} \end{equation} where $N\geq3$, $a&gt;0$ is fixed, $f$ satisfies mass-subcritical growth conditions and $h$ is a given bounded function with $||h||_\infty\le 1$. The $L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$-norm of $u$ is fixed and $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier. Our solutions are constructed by minimizing the corresponding energy functional on a suitable constraint. Due to the presence of a possibly nonradial term $h$, establishing compactness becomes challenging. To address this difficulty, we employ the splitting lemma to exclude both the vanishing and the dichotomy of a given any minimizing sequence for appropriate $a &gt; 0$.
  Furthermore, we show that if $h$ is radial, then radial solutions can be obtained for any $a&gt;0$. In this case, the radial symmetry allows us to prove that such solutions converge to a ground state solution of the limit problem as $\mu \to 0^+$.</description>

      <title>A general perspective on CBO methods with stochastic rate of information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) models featuring an additional stochastic rate of information, modeling the agents' knowledge of the environment and energy landscape. The well-posedness of the stochastic system is proved, together with its finite-particle approximation and the mean-field convergence to a kinetic PDE. Particles are shown to concentrate around the consensus point under mild assumptions on the initial spatial distribution and initial level of knowledge. In particular, the analysis unveils that a positive, however small, initial level of knowledge is enough for convergence to consensus to happen. The framework presented is general enough to include the first instances of CBO proposed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the state feedback control in an $% H^{\infty }$-optimal control problem involves a challenging approach of the associated algebraic Riccati equation of the generic form $A^{\ast }P+PA+P\Gamma P=F$. In view of this objective, we explore first in this paper the existence of the solution to this algebraic Riccati equation by a direct operatorial approach in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. The proofs are provided, under certain assumptions on the operators $\Gamma $ and $F,$ for the cases with $A$ coercive and $A\geq 0,$ respectively. Next, relying on the existence of the solution to the Riccati equation, we provide a result concerning the associated $H^{\infty }$-optimal control problem. An example regarding the application of the existence proof for the solution to the Riccati equation is given for a parabolic equation with a singular potential of Hardy type.</description>

The improvement on Kr\"oger's inequality resolves an open question raised by Weidl from 2006. The improvements allow us to show that, for any open bounded domains, there are infinite many Dirichlet eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 3$, and infinite many Neumann eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 5$ and the Neumann spectrum is discrete.</description>

      <title>Geometric reflective boundary conditions for asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article solves the initial boundary value problem for the vacuum Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant in dimension 4, giving rise to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. We introduce a new family of geometric reflective boundary conditions, which can be regarded as the homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, involving both the conformal class and the stress-energy tensor of the timelike conformal boundary. This family includes as a special case the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, consisting of setting the boundary stress-energy tensor to zero. It also agrees, in a limit case, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, where one fixes a locally conformally flat conformal class on the boundary, already covered in Friedrich's pioneering work of 1995.
  The proof of local existence and uniqueness for this family of boundary conditions relies notably on Friedrich's framework and his extended conformal Einstein equations. These are rewritten in a tensorial formalism, rather than a spinorial one, as it facilitates the comparison with the Fefferman-Graham expansion of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter metrics. Similarly to Friedrich's proof, our geometric boundary conditions are eventually inferred from gauge-dependent boundary conditions by means of an auxiliary system on the conformal boundary.
  In addition, our analysis also comprises new necessary and sufficient conditions for the unphysical fields associated to the initial data to be smooth up to the conformal boundary. Finally, the paper contains examples of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces, with a focus on their conformal boundary data. This provides valuable insight into the possible shapes of boundary stress-energy tensors.</description>

      <title>Potential Theory and the Boundary of Combinatorial Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite, connected graph. We investigate a notion of boundary $\partial G \subseteq V$ and argue that it is well behaved from the point of view of potential theory. This is done by proving a number of discrete analogous of classical results for compact domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. These include (1) an analogue of P\'olya's result that a random walk in $\Omega$ typically hits the boundary $\partial \Omega$ within $\lesssim \mbox{diam}(\Omega)^2$ units of time, (2) an analogue of the Faber-Krahn inequality, (3) an analogue of the Hardy inequality, (4) an analogue of the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate, (5) a stability estimate for hot spots and (6) a Theorem of Bj\"orck stating that probability measures $\mu$ that maximize $\int_{\Omega \times \Omega} \|x-y\|^{\alpha} d\mu(x) d\mu(y)$ are fully supported in the boundary.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two dimensional surface quasi-geostrophic equations with super-critical dissipation. For large initial data in critical Sobolev and Besov spaces, we prove optimal Gevrey regularity with the same decay exponent as the linear part. This settles several open problems in \cite{Bis14, BMS15}.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions to elliptic equations involving regional fractional Laplacian with order $(0,\frac12]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our purpose of this paper is to investigate positive solutions of the elliptic equation with regional fractional Laplacian $$
  ( - \Delta )_{B_1}^s u +u= h(x,u) \quad
  {\rm in} \ \, B_1,\qquad u\in C_0(B_1),
  $$
  where $( - \Delta )_{B_1}^s$ with $s\in(0,\frac12]$ is the regional fractional Laplacian and $h$ is the nonlinearity.
  Ordinarily, positive solutions vanishing at the boundary are not anticipated to be derived for the equations with regional fractional Laplacian of order $s\in(0,\frac12]$. Positive solutions are obtained when the nonlinearity assumes the following two models:
  $h(x,t)=f(x)$ or $h(x,t)=h_1(x)\, t^p+ \epsilon h_2(x)$, where $p&gt;1$, $\epsilon&gt;0$ small and $f, h_1, h_2$ are H\"older continuous, radially symmetric and decreasing functions under suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>The mixed fractional Hartree equations in Fourier amalgam and modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove local and global well-posedness for mixed fractional Hartree equation and with low regularity Cauchy data in Fourier amalgam $\F W(L^p,\ell^q)$ and modulation $M^{p,q}$ spaces. Similar results also hold for the Hartree equation with harmonic potential in some modulation spaces. Our approach also addresses Hartree-Fock equations of finitely many (but arbitrary large) particles. A key ingredient of our method is to establish trilinear estimates for Hartree non-linearity and the use of Strichartz estimates. As a consequence, we could gain $\F W(L^p,\ell^q)$ and $M^{p,q}-$regularity for all $p,q\in [1, \infty].$ In particular, we extend result of Bhimani-Grillakis-Okoudju \cite{bhimani2020hartree} in $M^{p,q}$ for all $p,q$ and complement known results in Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical measures for complex hyperbolic quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study semiclassical measures for Laplacian eigenfunctions on compact complex hyperbolic quotients. Geodesic flows on these quotients are a model case of hyperbolic dynamical systems with different expansion/contraction rates in different directions. We show that the support of any semiclassical measure is either equal to the entire cosphere bundle or contains the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic complex submanifold.
  The proof uses the one-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Bourgain-Dyatlov [arXiv:1612.09040] along the fast expanding/contracting directions, in a way similar to the work of Dyatlov-J\'ez\'equel [arXiv:2108.10463] in the toy model of quantum cat maps, together with a description of the closures of fast unstable/stable trajectories relying on Ratner theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a phase space analysis of evolution equations associated with the Weyl quantization $q^{\mathrm{w}}$ of a complex quadratic form $q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ with non-positive real part. In particular, we obtain pointwise bounds for the matrix coefficients of the Gabor wave packet decomposition of the generated semigroup $e^{tq^{\mathrm{w}}}$ if $\mathrm{Re} (q) \le 0$ and the companion singular space associated is trivial. This result is then leveraged to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the phase regularity of $e^{tq^{\mathrm{w}}}$ with $\mathrm{Re} (q) \le 0$, thereby extending the $L^2$ analysis of quadratic semigroups initiated by Hitrik and Pravda-Starov to general modulation spaces $M^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $1 \le p \le \infty$, with optimal explicit bounds.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for Dean-Kawasaki Models of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider systems of interacting particles which are described by a second order Langevin equation. The class of equations considered includes the situation where the particle evolution is governed by Hamiltonian dynamics with additional damping and noise satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Also covered are systems of two equations describing an evolution of interacting agents, as arising in several descriptions of active matter, including models for flocking and swarming. We first show that such particle systems can be represented exactly by so-called equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics, which in this case are stochastic versions of a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck type equation. While the derivation given here is simple, it is a blueprint for the rigorous derivation of equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. We then show a dichotomy previously known for purely diffusive (first order) systems carries over to the second order setting considered here: Solutions exist for suitable atomic initial data, in which case the solution is, properly scaled, the empirical density describing the particle system. For smooth initial data, however, we prove that no solution exists.</description>

Abstract: We study the local existence of solutions to the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system describing the motion of a compressible, viscous, electrically and heat conducting fluid in the $L^p-L^q$ class with inhomogeneous boundary conditions. The open system is allowed to receive incoming matter from the outside through (part of) the boundary which we refer to as an inflow boundary. This setup brings about a difficulty in estimating the regularity of the density $\varrho$ which we remedy by assuming appropriate hypotheses on the velocity field, domain boundary and on the boundary and initial data of $\varrho$. The main result ensures the local well-posedness of the full MHD system which is shown through a linearization combined with a Banach fixed-point theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the method of invariant sets of descending flows to demonstrate the existence of multiple sign-changing solutions for a class of elliptic problems with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. By combining Nehari manifold techniques with a constrained variational approach and Brouwer degree theory, we establish the existence of a least-energy sign-changing solution. Furthermore, we prove that the energy of the least energy sign-changing solution is strictly greater than twice the ground state energy. This work extends the celebrated results of Bartsch $et~al.$ [Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (3), 91(1): 129-152, 2005] and Chang $et~al.$ [Adv. Nonlinear Stud., 19(1): 29-53, 2019] to the mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace operator, providing a novel contribution even in the case when $p=2$.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the convergence of a perturbed circular interface for the two-phase Mullins-Sekerka evolution in flat two-dimensional space. Our method is based on the gradient flow structure of the evolution and captures two distinct regimes of the dynamics, an initial - and novel - phase of algebraic-in-time decay and a later - and previously explored - phase of exponential-in-time decay. By quantifying the initial phase of relaxation, our method allows for the investigation of systems with large initial dissipation as long as the isoperimetric deficit is small enough. We include quantitative estimates of the solution in terms of its initial data, including the $C^{1}$-distance to the center manifold of circles and the displacement of the barycenter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of two singular semi-linear elliptic equations, patterned after the Schr\"odinger-Maxwell system, is considered. If the reaction term of the first equation contains a datum $f\in L^m$, existence of positive solutions with finite energy is established for suitable ranges of $m$. In particular, the results from the theory of elliptic single equations are improved. At the same time, thanks to an approach based on approximation schemes and a priori estimates on the approximated sequences of solutions, it is shown that the integrability assumptions on the datum produce higher integrability of the solutions.</description>

      <title>The Logarithmic Laplacian on General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish, for the first time, a Bochner-type integral representation for the logarithmic Laplacian on weighted graphs. Assuming stochastic completeness of the underlying graph, we further derive an explicit pointwise formula for this operator:
  \[
  \log(-\Delta)\:u(x)
  =\frac{1}{\mu(x)}\sum_{y\neq x}W_{\log}(x,y)\,(u(x)-u(y))
  -\frac{1}{\mu(x)}\sum_{y}W(x,y)\,u(y)
  +\Gamma'(1)\,u(x).
  \] In the case of weighted lattice graphs with uniformly positive vertex measures, we obtain sharp two-sided bounds for the associated logarithmic kernel. Additionally, we prove that the logarithmic Laplacian is unbounded on $\ell^{2}$, and we present an alternative derivation of its pointwise form. Moreover, for every $1 &lt; p \leq \infty$ and all $u \in C_c(\mathbb{Z}^{d})$, we establish a strong convergence in $\ell^{p}$: \[\frac{(-\Delta)^{s} u - u}{s} \longrightarrow \log(-\Delta) \:u \quad \text{as } s \to 0^{+}.\]Finally, on the standard lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, we compute the Fourier multipliers corresponding to both the fractional Laplacian and the logarithmic Laplacian, and derive exact large-time behavior and off-diagonal asymptotics of the associated diffusion kernels, including all sharp asymptotic constants.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and stability in determining the wave equation from a single passive boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering both the wave speed coefficient and an unknown initial condition (acting as the source) for the multidimensional wave equation from a single passive boundary measurement. Specifically, we establish uniqueness and H\"{o}lder stability estimates for determining these parameters in the wave equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$, where only a single boundary measurement of the solution--generated by the unknown source--is available. Our work connects to thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography (TAT/PAT) for the physically relevant case of piecewise constant sound speeds. We significantly relax the stringent conditions previously required for resolving this problem, extending results to general classes of piecewise constant sound speeds over inclusions with unknown locations. Moreover, we do not require decay properties in time of solutions to the wave equation, which enables our study to accommodate a much broader class of unknown sources. The approach combines low frequency-domain solution representations with distinctive properties of elliptic and hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Regularizing Effect for a Nonlocal Maxwell-Schr\"odinger System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove existence and regularity of weak solutions for the following system
  \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  &amp;-\mbox{div}\Bigg(\bigg(\|\nabla u\|^{p}_{L^{p}}+\|\nabla v\|^{p}_{L^{p}}\bigg)|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u\Bigg) + g(x,u,v)=f \ \ \ \mbox{in} \ \Omega;
  &amp;-\mbox{div}\Bigg(\bigg(\|\nabla u\|^{p}_{L^{p}}+\|\nabla v\|^{p}_{L^{p}}\bigg)|\nabla v|^{p-2}\nabla v\Bigg) = h(x,u,v) \ \ \ \ \mbox{in} \ \Omega;
  &amp;u=v=0 \ \mbox{on} \ \partial\Omega.
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  where $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N&gt;2$, $f\in L^m(\Omega)$, where $m&gt;1$ and $g$, $h$ are two Carath\'eodory functions, which may be non monotone. We prove that under appropriate conditions on $g$ and $h$, there is gain of Sobolev and Lebesgue regularity for the solutions of this system.</description>

      <title>The $\overline\partial$-Robin Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the family of operators $\{\mathcal{R}_a\}_{a\in [0,+\infty)}$ associated to the Robin-type problems in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ $$
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u = f &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\
  2 \bar \nu \partial_{\bar z} u + au = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega,
  \end{cases} $$ and their dependency on the boundary parameter $a$ as it moves along $[0,+\infty)$. In this regard, we study the convergence of such operators in a resolvent sense. We also describe the eigenvalues of such operators and show some of their properties, both for all fixed $a$ and as functions of the parameter $a$. As shall be seen in more detail in arXiv:2507.18698, the eigenvalues of these operators characterize the positive eigenvalues of quantum dot Dirac operators.</description>

      <title>Observability inequalities for heat equations with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with the observability inequalities for heat equations with time-dependent Lipschtiz potentials. The observability inequality for heat equations asserts that the total energy of a solution is bounded above by the energy localized in a subdomain with an observability constant. For a bounded measurable potential $V = V(x,t)$, the factor in the observability constant arising from the Carleman estimate is best known to be $\exp(C\|V\|_{\infty}^{2/3})$ (even for time-independent potentials). In this paper, we show that, for Lipschtiz potentials, this factor can be replaced by $\exp(C(\|\nabla V\|_{\infty}^{1/2} +\|\partial_tV\|_{\infty}^{1/3} ))$, which improves the previous bound $\exp(C\|V\|_{\infty}^{2/3})$ in some typical scenarios. As a consequence, with such a Lipschitz potential, we obtain a quantitative regular control in a null controllability problem. In addition, for the one-dimensional heat equation with some time-independent bounded measurable potential $V = V(x)$, we obtain the optimal observability constant.</description>

      <title>A note on spontaneous symmetry breaking in the mean-field Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous Bose gas in the three-dimensional unit torus, where $N$ particles interact via a two-body potential of the form $N^{-1} v(x)$. The system is studied at inverse temperatures of order $N^{-2/3}$, which corresponds to the temperature scale of the Bose--Einstein condensation phase transition. We show that spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking occurs if and only if the system exhibits Bose--Einstein condensation in the sense that the one-particle density matrix of the Gibbs state has a macroscopic eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>On the controllability of laminated beams with Venttsel-type boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the boundary controllability of a Timoshenko laminated beam system subject to Venttsel-type boundary conditions. The study focuses on a novel configuration in which three controls are applied solely at the boundary of the beam. Controllability is established by deriving an appropriate observability inequality for the corresponding adjoint system, which is then employed within the framework of the duality method in the setup of the classical Hilbert uniqueness method (HUM) to achieve the control problem. The main contribution lies in the analysis of a system comprising three beams governed by dynamic Venttsel-type boundary conditions, as introduced by Venttsel in [Theory Probab. Appl., 4 (1959)].</description>
