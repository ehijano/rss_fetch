      <title>Non-Linear behavior of the Electron Cyclotron Drift Instability and the Suppression of Anomalous Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of one-dimensional collisionless simulations of plasma turbulence and related anomalous electron current of the Electron Cyclotron Drift Instability (ECDI). Our highly resolved, long-term simulations of xenon plasma in the magnetic field performed with the WarpX particle-in-cell (PIC) code show several intermediate non-linear stages before the system enters a stationary state with significantly increased electron temperature and a finite level of energy in the electrostatic fluctuations. In early and intermediate non-linear stages, the fluctuations are driven by the electron cyclotron resonances gradually shifting from higher ($m&gt;1$) modes to the fundamental $m=1$ resonance. Enhanced resonant growth is observed from the point when the cyclotron $m=1$ mode coincides with the most unstable ion-acoustic mode. In the final stage, the anomalous electron current existing in intermediate stages is quenched to zero. Following this quenching, our simulations reveal a transition from ECDI-driven dynamics to saturated ion-acoustic turbulence. The modification of the electron and ion distribution functions and their roles in the non-linear developments and saturation of the instability are analyzed at different non-linear stages. The non-linear development of ECDI driven by the $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ electron drift from the applied current and the ECDI driven by the ion beam perpendicular to the magnetic field are compared and characterized as two perspectives of the instability, observed through different Doppler-shifted frames. An extension of this work incorporating full the dynamics of magnetized ions for ECDI driven by a hydrogen ion beam is shown to develop full beam inversion, with the periodic bursts of growth-saturation cycles of ECDI.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Magnetohydrodynamic Modelling of Flux Pumping in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sawtooth-free hybrid scenario has been achieved recently in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) with applied non-inductive current sources and auxiliary heating [A. Burckhart et al 2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 126056]. Control experiments in AUG suggest that the self-regulating magnetic flux pumping mechanism, characterized by anomalous current redistribution, is responsible for clamping the central safety factor (q_0) close to unity, thereby preventing the sawtooth onset. This work presents a numerical and theoretical investigation of flux pumping in the AUG hybrid scenario based on the two-temperature, visco-resistive, full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model with the JOREK code. To quantitatively model the flux pumping, we choose realistic parameters, plasma configurations, and source terms based on AUG experiments. During the initial saturation stage of the unstable 1/1 quasi-interchange mode (on millisecond timescales), q_0 exhibits fast under-damped oscillation and reaches a value closer to unity, which is attributed to the self-regulation of core plasma and the fast dynamo effect on the order of V/m. On the longer resistive diffusion timescale of seconds, the slow negative dynamo effect on the order of mV/m induced by the 1/1 MHD instability plays an effective role in flux pumping, which provides quantitative agreement with experimental observations for the first time. The final saturated 1/1 MHD instability exhibits features of the quasi-interchange mode and tearing mode, and the associated convective plasma flow velocity is a few m/s. The toroidal negative electric field from the slow dynamo dominantly offsets the positive current drive and continuously redistributes the current density and pressure. As a result, q_0 is maintained close to unity due to the low-shear profiles of current density and pressure in the plasma core, and the system enters a sawtooth-free and quasi-stationary helical state.</description>

      <title>Novatron: Equilibrium and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Novatron is a fusion concept characterized by its axisymmetric mirror-cusp magnetic topology. The magnetic field exhibits good curvature and a high mirror ratio. Plasma equilibrium profiles for the Novatron are obtained by solving an axisymmetric guiding-center anisotropic boundary-value problem. These profiles are then analyzed with respect to several MHD stability criteria, including the mirror, firehose, and interchange conditions. A generalized Rosenbluth and Longmire MHD interchange criterion, where anisotropic pressure variations along flux tubes are allowed for, is subsequently employed for determining stable MHD equilibria. Additionally, a corresponding CGL double adiabatic interchange criterion is investigated for obtaining stable equilibria in the collisionless limit, both theoretically and numerically using the large scale Hybrid Particle-In-Cell code WarpX.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear particle motion and bursty periodic energy deposition in inductively coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle motion and power deposition in inductively coupled plasmas. We show that under condition of low-frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low-pressure, the electron motion is highly nonlinear in the skin region near the coil: electrons are strongly magnetized, and the energy deposition is small throughout most of the RF cycle. However, during the phase when the RF magnetic field vanishes, electrons briefly demagnetize, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the plasma. During these short time intervals the power deposition becomes high, resulting in periodic bursts in the energy deposition. We developed a new kinetic theory, which not only provides analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition, but also predicts a new nonlinear relation between electron current and the RF inductive electric field. A criterion for transition between the low frequency, periodic bursty nonlinear regime and the high frequency, anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified using a series of fully kinetic 2D particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>The shear Alfv\'en continuum of quasisymmetric stellarators. Part 1. Perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shear Alfv\'en wave (SAW) continuum plays a critical role in the stability of energetic particle-driven Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the SAW continuum in three-dimensional quasisymmetric magnetic fields, focusing on its implications for stellarator design. By employing a near-axis model and degenerate perturbation theory, the continuum equation is solved, highlighting unique features in 3D configurations, such as the interactions between spectral gaps. Numerical examples validate the theory, demonstrating the impact of flux surface shaping and quasisymmetric field properties on continuum structure. The results provide insights into optimizing stellarator configurations to minimize resonance-driven losses of energetic particles. This work establishes a basis for incorporating Alfv\'enic stability considerations into the stellarator design process, demonstrated through optimization of a quasihelical configuration to avoid high-frequency spectral gaps.</description>

      <title>Robustness Optimization for Compact Free-electron Laser Driven by Laser Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the successful demonstration of compact free electron lasers (FELs) driven by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs), the shot-to-shot fluctuations inherent to LWFAs remain a major obstacle to realizing LWFA-driven FELs with high gain and robust operation. Here, we present a conceptual design for LWFA-driven FELs with enhanced robustness and reliability. By employing Bayesian optimization techniques, the beamline was optimized to achieve sufficient tolerance against these fluctuations under actual experimental conditions. Start-to-end simulations revealed that this systematic optimization significantly reduces the system's sensitivity to parametric variations. With the optimized configurations, the radiation energy can be maintained above 1 {\mu}J at a wavelength of approximately 25 nm, even when accounting for twice the root-mean-square (RMS) ranges of these inherent jitters. This proposed scheme represents a substantial advancement in the development of compact LWFA-driven FEL systems, enabling robust operation and paving the way for the realization of reliable and widely accessible sources.</description>

      <title>A framework for discrete optimization of stellarator coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing magnets for three-dimensional plasma confinement is a key task for advancing the stellarator as a fusion reactor concept. Stellarator magnets must produce an accurate field while leaving adequate room for other components and being reasonably simple to construct and assemble. In this paper, a framework for coil design and optimization is introduced that enables the attainment of sparse magnet solutions with arbitrary restrictions on where coils may be located. The solution space is formulated as a "wireframe" consisting of a mesh of interconnected wire segments enclosing the plasma. Two methods are developed for optimizing the current distribution on a wireframe: Regularized Constrained Least Squares (RCLS), which uses a linear least-squares approach to optimize the currents in each segment, and Greedy Stellarator Coil Optimization (GSCO), a fully discrete procedure in which loops of current are added to the mesh one by one to achieve the desired magnetic field on the plasma boundary. Examples are presented of solutions obtainable with each method, some of which achieve high field accuracy while obeying spatial constraints that permit easy assembly.</description>
