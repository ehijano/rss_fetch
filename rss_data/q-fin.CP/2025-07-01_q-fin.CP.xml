      <title>SABR-Informed Multitask Gaussian Process: A Synthetic-to-Real Framework for Implied Volatility Surface Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing the Implied Volatility Surface (IVS) is a challenging task in quantitative finance due to the complexity of real markets and the sparsity of market data. Structural models like Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho (SABR) model offer interpretability and theoretical consistency but lack flexibility, while purely data-driven methods such as Gaussian Process regression can struggle with sparse data. We introduce SABR-Informed Multi-Task Gaussian Process (SABR-MTGP), treating IVS construction as a multi-task learning problem. Our method uses a dense synthetic dataset from a calibrated SABR model as a source task to inform the construction based on sparse market data (the target task). The MTGP framework captures task correlation and transfers structural information adaptively, improving predictions particularly in data-scarce regions. Experiments using Heston-generated ground truth data under various market conditions show that SABR-MTGP outperforms both standard Gaussian process regression and SABR across different maturities. Furthermore, an application to real SPX market data demonstrates the method's practical applicability and its ability to produce stable and realistic surfaces. This confirms our method balances structural guidance from SABR with the flexibility needed for market data.</description>

      <title>Deep Hedging to Manage Tail Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending Buehler et al.'s 2019 Deep Hedging paradigm, we innovatively employ deep neural networks to parameterize convex-risk minimization (CVaR/ES) for the portfolio tail-risk hedging problem. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on crisis-era bootstrap market simulators -- customizable with transaction costs, risk budgets, liquidity constraints, and market impact -- our end-to-end framework not only achieves significant one-day 99% CVaR reduction but also yields practical insights into friction-aware strategy adaptation, demonstrating robustness and operational viability in realistic markets.</description>

      <title>Potential Customer Lifetime Value in Financial Institutions: The Usage Of Open Banking Data to Improve CLV Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly adopt customer-centric strategies to enhance profitability and build long-term relationships. While Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a core metric, its calculations often rely solely on single-entity data, missing insights from customer activities across multiple firms. This study introduces the Potential Customer Lifetime Value (PCLV) framework, leveraging Open Banking (OB) data to estimate customer value comprehensively. We predict retention probability and estimate Potential Contribution Margins (PCM) from competitor data, enabling PCLV calculation. Results show that OB data can be used to estimate PCLV per competitor, indicating a potential upside of 21.06% over the Actual CLV. PCLV offers a strategic tool for managers to strengthen competitiveness by leveraging OB data and boost profitability by driving marketing efforts at the individual customer level to increase the Actual CLV.</description>

      <title>Can We Reliably Predict the Fed's Next Move? A Multi-Modal Approach to U.S. Monetary Policy Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting central bank policy decisions remains a persistent challenge for investors, financial institutions, and policymakers due to the wide-reaching impact of monetary actions. In particular, anticipating shifts in the U.S. federal funds rate is vital for risk management and trading strategies. Traditional methods relying only on structured macroeconomic indicators often fall short in capturing the forward-looking cues embedded in central bank communications.
  This study examines whether predictive accuracy can be enhanced by integrating structured data with unstructured textual signals from Federal Reserve communications. We adopt a multi-modal framework, comparing traditional machine learning models, transformer-based language models, and deep learning architectures in both unimodal and hybrid settings.
  Our results show that hybrid models consistently outperform unimodal baselines. The best performance is achieved by combining TF-IDF features of FOMC texts with economic indicators in an XGBoost classifier, reaching a test AUC of 0.83. FinBERT-based sentiment features marginally improve ranking but perform worse in classification, especially under class imbalance. SHAP analysis reveals that sparse, interpretable features align more closely with policy-relevant signals.
  These findings underscore the importance of integrating textual and structured signals transparently. For monetary policy forecasting, simpler hybrid models can offer both accuracy and interpretability, delivering actionable insights for researchers and decision-makers.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15828v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies by enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, accurate forecasting remains challenging due to complex nonlinear dependencies, high-dimensional feature spaces, and limited sample sizes-conditions under which classical machine learning models are prone to overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model with Amplitude Encoding, leveraging the unitarity constraint of Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQC) and the exponential data compression capability of qubits. We evaluate the model on a global recovery rate dataset comprising 1,725 observations and 256 features from 1996 to 2023. Our hybrid method significantly outperforms both classical neural networks and QML models using Angle Encoding, achieving a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.228, compared to 0.246 and 0.242, respectively. It also performs competitively with ensemble tree methods such as XGBoost. While practical implementation challenges remain for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, our quantum simulation and preliminary results on noisy simulators demonstrate the promise of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of recovery rate forecasting. These findings illustrate the potential of quantum machine learning in shaping the future of credit risk prediction.</description>
