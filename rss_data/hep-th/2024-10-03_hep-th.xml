      <title>The horocycle regulator: exact cutoff-independence in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the entanglement entropy of a single subregion in quantum field theory is formally infinite and requires regularization, certain combinations of entropies are perfectly finite in the limit that the regulator is removed, the mutual information being a common example. For generic regulator schemes, such as a holographic calculation with a uniform radial cutoff, these quantities show non-trivial dependence on the regulator at finite values of the cutoff. We investigate a holographic regularization scheme defined in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space constructed from \textit{horocycles}, curves in two-dimensional hyperbolic space perpendicular to all geodesics approaching a single point on the boundary, that leads to finite information measures that are \textit{totally} cutoff-independent, even at finite values of the regulator. We describe a broad class of such information measures, and describe how the field theory dual to the horocycle regulator is inherently non-local.</description>

      <title>On the renormalization of massive vector field theory coupled to scalar in curved space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the renormalization of massive vector field interacting with charged scalar field in curved spacetime. Starting with the theory minimally coupled to external gravity and using the formulations with and without St\"uckelberg fields, we show that the longitudinal mode of vector field is completely decoupled and the remaining theory of transverse vector field is renormalizable by power counting. The formal arguments based on the covariance and power counting indicate that multiplicative renormalizability of the interacting theory may require introducing two non-minimal terms linear in Ricci tensor in the vector sector. Nevertheless, a more detailed analysis shows that these non-minimal terms violate the decoupling of the longitudinal mode and are prohibited. As a verification of general arguments, we derive the one-loop divergences in the minimal massive scalar QED, using St\"uckelberg procedure and the heat-kernel technique. The theory without non-minimal terms proves one-loop renormalizable and admits the renormalization group equations for all the running parameters in the scalar and vector sectors. One-loop beta functions do not depend on the gauge fixing and can be used to derive the effective potential.</description>

      <title>Regge-Teitelboim cosmology driven by a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the dynamic equations governing a Regge Teitelboim (RT) brane that represents our universe considering that its degrees of freedom are the embedding functions, evolving in a five dimensional curved spacetime. Within this framework, we investigate the effects of embedding a Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) metric into a specific curved ambient spacetime. This approach allows us to analyze in detail how the ambient spacetime's curvature influences the brane universe's dynamics. Specifically, we examine the relationship between the Hubble parameter $H$ and the redshift $z$, demonstrating that our results significantly agree with actual observational data. This is contrasted and compared with other approaches.</description>

      <title>(In)stability of the Higgs vacuum from the $\textrm{O}(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of an independent Higgs field is given by an $\textrm{O}(N)$ model with an $N$-component scalar $\vec{\phi}$ and a quartic $\lambda(\vec{\phi}\cdot\vec{\phi})^2$ potential when $N=4$. The phase structure of the theory can be studied analytically for all values of the coupling $\lambda$ using the large-$N$ limit, both at zero and finite temperature. However, authors in the 70s and 80s argued the theory at large $N$ was "sick" and "futile", and dismissed the theory. This was based on two points: (1) a failure to identify the stable phases and vacuum of the theory and (2) the issue of a negative bare coupling $\lambda&lt;0$ in the UV. We provide evidence that the theory is not, in fact, "sick". Issue (2) is dealt with through the modern understanding of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric non-Hermitian theories with "wrong-sign" couplings. Issue (1) is resolved by realizing that the true vacuum has no spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and that the SSB phase only becomes preferred at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Gauge Theory, Hyperbolic Geometry and Virasoro Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that the moduli space of hyperbolic metrics on the disc can be identified with the Virasoro coadjoint orbit $\mathrm{Diff}^+(S^1) / \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. The interest in this relationship has recently been revived in the study of two-dimensional JT gravity and it raises the natural question if all Virasoro orbits $\mathcal{O}$ arise as moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics. In this article, we give an affirmative answer to this question using $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge theory on a cylinder $S$: to any $L\in\mathcal{O}$ we assign a flat $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge field $A_L = (g_L)^{-1} dg_L$, and we explain how the global properties and singularities of the hyperbolic geometry are encoded in the monodromies and winding numbers of $g_L$, and how they depend on the Virasoro orbit. In particular, we show that the somewhat mysterious geometries associated with Virasoro orbits with no constant representative $L$ arise from large gauge transformations acting on standard (constant $L$ ) funnel or cuspidal geometries, shedding some light on their potential physical significance: e.g. they describe new topological sectors of two-dimensional gravity, characterised by twisted boundary conditions. Using a gauge theoretic gluing construction, we also obtain a complete dictionary between Virasoro coadjoint orbits and moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics with specified boundary projective structure.</description>

      <title>Natural Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a large class of chiral gauge theories in four dimensions it was found that certain natural assumption about the bifermion condensates leads to the infrared effective theory where the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions are satisfied in an entirely evident fashion, without need of verifying arithmetic equations. This is due to the fact that in these systems, characterized by dynamical color (and flavor) symmetry breaking, the quantum numbers and multiplicities of the low-energy massless fermions match exactly those of the fermions in the UV theory which do not condense and remain massless, with respect to the unbroken symmetries. This means also that the stronger constraints following from the matching request of mixed anomalies involving certain generalized 1-form center symmetries, as well as some global anomalies such as Witten's $SU(2)$ anomaly, are all fully satisfied. It is the aim of this note to clarify better the working of this phenomenon (which we call Natural Anomaly Matching), correct some earlier statements made about it, and illustrate it further with a few new examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper methods for deforming scalar field theories on Euclidean target spaces, in which new field theories are constructed so that solutions are known, are generalized to the context of Sigma models. In particular, deformations between Sigma models on the plane and on the sphere are considered. Three different examples are presented, where the change in the structure of the kink variety and the energy of the deformed kinks during this procedure are studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists a natural analogue of the Yang-Mills equations using the Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis bracket between vector-valued differential forms. The gauge field is a rank-two tensor, and when one constrains it to be symmetric, then the system exhibits fractonic behaviours. In the linearised limit, the constrained equations of motion reduce to those of the covariant fracton model [Bertolini-Maggiore 2022].</description>

      <title>Superfield twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SCFTs and their renormalization-group improved generating functional in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SYM theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new construction of superfield collinear twist-$2$ operators as infinite-dimensional, irreducible representations of the collinear superconformal algebra in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. As an application, we realize the above representations in terms of free superfields, in a manifestly gauge-invariant and supersymmetric-covariant fashion, in the zero coupling limit of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. This realization makes manifest their mixing and renormalization properties at one loop. We also extend the techniques in [1-4] to a large class of free superconformal field theories in the superspace formalism. Specifically, we compute the generating functional of superfield twist-2 operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU($N$) SYM theory in the zero coupling limit. We also work out in a closed form the corresponding asymptotic renormalization-group improved generating functional in Euclidean superspace. The latter is relevant for the search of the yet-to-come non-perturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU($N$) SYM theory.</description>

      <title>Topological entanglement and number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent developments in the study of topological multi-boundary entanglement in the context of 3d Chern-Simons theory (with gauge group $G$ and level $k$) suggest a strong interplay between entanglement measures and number theory. The purpose of this note is twofold. First, we conjecture that the 'sum of the negative powers of the quantum dimensions of all integrable highest weight representations at level $k$' is an integer multiple of the Witten zeta function of $G$ when $k \to \infty$. This provides an alternative way to compute these zeta functions, and we present some examples. Next, we use this conjecture to investigate number-theoretic properties of the R\'enyi entropies of the quantum state associated with the $S^3$ complement of torus links of type $T_{p,p}$. In particular, we show that in the semiclassical limit of $k \to \infty$, these entropies converge to a finite value. This finite value can be written in terms of the Witten zeta functions of the group $G$ evaluated at positive even integers.</description>

In this theory, we introduce the gauge fixing to obtain the propagator for the RS field, and calculate the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term, which turns out to be finite and ambiguous, and only in one calculation scheme, based on the nonlinear gauge framework, the gauge independence of the result is achieved.</description>

      <title>Exploring Defects with Degrees of Freedom in Free Scalar CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories are interesting objects to study from both formal and applied points of view. In this paper, we construct conformal defects in free scalar field CFTs in diverse dimensions. After discussing the possible quadratic defects, we explore interacting setups. These are realized by coupling the bulk free scalar to lower-dimensional theories, including the unitary family of minimal models $\mathcal{M}(p, p+1)$. Another example involves coupling to a two-dimensional free scalar field, from which we construct surface defects for the bulk dimensions three and five. Additionally, we consider monodromy defects associated with a global $U(1)$ flavour symmetry. In these theories, we study both self-defect interactions and couplings to Minimal Models, finding new IR defect fixed points. For all our examples, we provide results for correlation functions, such as those involving the bulk stress tensor and the displacement operator, and for the defect central charges.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $f(Q)$ gravity models in the non-coincident formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article investigates cosmological applications of $f(Q)$ theories in a non-coincident formalism. We explore a new $f(Q)$ theory dynamics utilizing a non-vanishing affine connection involving a non-constant function $\gamma(t)=-a^{-1}\dot{H}$, resulting in Friedmann equations that are entirely distinct from those of $f(T)$ theory. In addition, we propose a new parameterization of the Hubble function that can consistently depicts the present deceleration parameter value, transition redshift, and the late time de-Sitter limit. We evaluate the predictions of the assumed Hubble function by imposing constraints on the free parameters utilizing Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability by employing the CC, Pantheon+SH0ES, and the BAO samples. Moreover, we conduct the AIC and BIC statistical evaluations to determine the reliability of MCMC analysis. Further, we consider some well-known corrections to the STEGR case such as an exponentital $f(Q)$ correction, logarithmic $f(Q)$ correction, and a power-law $f(Q)$ correction and then we find the constraints on the parameters of these models via energy conditions. Finally, to test the physical plausibility of the assumed $f(Q)$ models we conduct the thermodynamical stability analysis via the sound speed parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a review of James Read's insightful book, Background Independence in Classical and Quantum Gravity. The book introduces various notions of background-independence which it then makes precise, and uses to make verdicts about background-independence on a wide range of examples of spacetime theories in both classical and quantum gravity. This short book is, in several ways, a worthy example of how technical philosophy of physics ought to be done. I first discuss the content, then raise a number points where I disagree with the book.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry in the Landau Level Problem with a Disorder Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a supersymmetric (SUSY) theory that arises in the Landau level problem with disorder. Charged particles in a strong magnetic field and a local potential are described by small excitations around the ground state, the lowest Landau level (LLL). Around forty years ago Br\'ezin, Gross and Itzykson showed that for a disorder potential certain observables in the LLL limit are described by a chiral SUSY theory. As a consequence, the problem undergoes a dimensional reduction by two dimensions, simplifying the computations. We generalize their findings by identifying the chiral SUSY as a special limit of a `magnetic Parisi-Sourlas (PS)' theory. The latter is a modification of the theories associated to fixed points of random field models. We show that the SUSY features extend to a much larger class of observables and to higher Landau levels. Finally we identify a set of new super-Ward identities and show how observables in the disordered theory must satisfy them.</description>

      <title>Conformal Leptogenesis in Composite Higgs Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of the baryon asymmetry in Composite Higgs models with partial compositeness of the Standard Model (SM) fermions and heavy right-handed neutrinos, developing for the first time a complete picture of leptogenesis in that setup. The asymmetry is induced by the out of equilibrium decays of the heavy right-handed neutrinos into a plasma of the nearly conformal field theory (CFT), i.e. the deconfined phase of the Composite Higgs dynamics. This exotic mechanism, which we call Conformal Leptogenesis, admits a reliable description in terms of a set of ``Boltzmann equations'' whose coefficients can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of the CFT. The asymmetry thus generated is subsequently affected by the supercooling resulting from the confining phase transition of the strong Higgs sector as well as by the washout induced by the resonances formed after the transition. Nevertheless, a qualitative description of the latter effects suggests that conformal leptogenesis can successfully reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry in a wide region of parameter space. A distinctive signature of our scenarios is a sizable compositeness for all the generations of SM neutrinos, which is currently consistent with all constraints but may be within reach of future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological order that arises from chiral states with ${\rm SU}(N)$ or ${\rm SO}(N)$ edge-state symmetry. This extends our previous study of topological orders that descend from the bosonic $E_8$ quantum Hall state. We use exactly solvable models of coupled electron wires to construct states with ${\rm SU}(m)_n$, ${\rm SO}(m)_n$, or ${\rm Sp}(m)_n$ topological order for various levels $n$. We use our constructions to write down string operators for various non-Abelian anyons. We thereby provide a systematic, microscopic understanding of quantum Hall states, topological superconductors, and spin liquids with emergent non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations, including those of Ising, metaplectic, and Fibonacci type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores modifications to General Relativity (GR) by considering higher-order curvature terms in the gravitational action, specifically focusing on the quadratic Ricci scalar and a particular cubic contraction of the Riemann tensor. These modifications introduce new interactions at short distances, potentially altering the dynamics of compact objects. We calculate the effective two-body binding potential energy for these modified theories to quantify these effects using the worldline effective field theory (WEFT) formalism. This approach allows us to systematically integrate out short-distance gravitational effects, capturing the modifications to the binding potential. Our results demonstrate how the quadratic Ricci scalar and cubic Riemann tensor terms contribute to the two-body interaction at the leading order, highlighting deviations from classical GR predictions. These findings provide insight into the possible observational signatures of such modified gravity theories in binary systems and other astrophysical settings.</description>

Abstract: We study the Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity with the most general Lagrangian quadratic in curvature and torsion, focusing on the possible interaction of the axial torsion with the electromagnetic field. From the analysis of the closed system of field equations, we identify the magnetic helicity density and the spin density of the electromagnetic field as the components of the source for the torsion field. We consider the propagation of a linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave and demonstrate the ``dichroism'' or the polarization rotation effect under the action of external electric and magnetic fields orthogonal to the direction of wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Superradiant scattering in Lorentz-violating gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes in Lorentz violating gravity enjoy a double horizon structure which resembles that of the Kerr solution in General Relativity. Moreover, when a scalar field with a modified dispersion relation is coupled to these backgrounds, an on-shell mode with negative energy becomes possible in the region in between the horizons. Both properties together call for the possibility of extracting energy from the black hole by scattering of waves, even if the space-time is stationary. Here, we perform such scattering explicitly in the frequency domain, showing that indeed, a superradiant effect, leading to energy extraction, can be observed for modes with $l&gt;0$ in spherical symmetry. In particular, we show that the mode $l=1$ can display a reflectivity exceeding 700% for certain values of the Lorentz violating scale. This leads us to conjecture the instability of these space-times against such perturbations, although astrophysical size objects should have long life-times. Our results are not unique to Lorentz violating gravity and can be extended to any setting where modified dispersion relations are present, such as analogue gravity.</description>

      <title>Massive Scalar Corrections to Gravitational Potentials in the On-Shell Renormalization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop corrections induced by a non-minimally coupled massive scalar to the two gravitational potentials sourced by a static point mass in Minkowski space via solving the effective Einstein field equations. We first obtain a manifestly transverse graviton self-energy and, by performing resummation of the bubble diagrams, derive the associated dressed graviton propagator in the general covariant gauge. For one class of gauges, which include the Landau gauge, the dressed graviton propagator becomes proportional to the tree-level propagator in the on-shell limit. This fact allows us to employ the on-shell renormalization scheme so that the renormalized Newton constant $G$ takes the value measured in the experiments. The resulting corrections to the gravitational potentials share similar structures with the vacuum polarization correction to the Coulomb potential regarding their analytic expressions and long distance behavior. By comparing our results with gravitational slip measurements, we establish a constraint on the non-minimal coupling: $|\xi| \lesssim 5\times 10^{43}/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Path integral treatment of coherence effects in charmonium production in nuclear ultra-peripheral collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present for the first time a revised study of charmonium production in nuclear ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) based on a rigorous Green function formalism. This formalism allows for the proper incorporation of the effects of color transparency, as well as the quantum coherence inherent in the higher twist quark shadowing related to the $Q\bar Q$ Fock component of the photon. The significance of this effect gradually decreases towards forward and/or backward rapidities. In the LHC kinematic region we additionally incorporate within the same formalism the leading twist gluon shadowing corrections related to higher multi-gluon photon fluctuations. They represent a dominant source of nuclear phenomena in the mid-rapidity region. Model predictions for the rapidity distributions $d\sigma/dy$ are in good agreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and the LHC. They can also be verified by future measurements at the LHC, as well as at EIC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-dependent behaviour of quantum correlations of a system of an inverted oscillator governed by out-of-equilibrium dynamics using the well-known Schwinger-Keldysh formalism in presence of quantum mechanical quench. Considering a generalized structure of a time-dependent Hamiltonian for an inverted oscillator system, we use the invariant operator method to obtain its eigenstates and continuous energy eigenvalues. Using the expression for the eigenstates, we further derive the most general expression for the generating function as well as the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) for the given system using this formalism. Further, considering the time-dependent coupling and frequency of the quantum inverted oscillator characterized by quench parameters, we comment on the dynamical behaviour, specifically the early, intermediate and late time-dependent features of the OTOC for the quenched quantum inverted oscillator. Next, we study a specific case, where the system of inverted oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviour by computing the quantum Lyapunov exponent from the time-dependent behaviour of OTOC in presence of the given quench profile.</description>

Abstract: We propose a geometric relation between closed and open string amplitudes at one-loop. After imposing a homological splitting on the world-sheet torus twisted intersection theory is used to establish a one-loop double copy relation. The latter expresses a closed string amplitude by a pair of open string amplitudes and twisted intersection numbers. These inner products on the vector space of allowed differential forms are related to the twisted homology and cohomology groups associated with the Riemann-Wirtinger integral.</description>

Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we consider a positive geometry conjectured to encode the loop integrand of four-point stress-energy correlators in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. Beginning with four lines in twistor space, we characterize a positive subspace to which an $\ell$-loop geometry is attached. The loop geometry then consists of $\ell$ lines in twistor space satisfying positivity conditions among themselves and with respect to the base. Consequently, the $\textit{loop geometry}$ can be viewed as fibration over a $\textit{tree geometry}$. The fibration naturally dissects the base into chambers, in which the degree-$4 \ell$ loop form is unique and distinct for each chamber. Interestingly, up to three loops, the chambers are simply organized by the six ordering of $x^2_{1,2}x^2_{3,4}$, $x^2_{1,4}x^2_{2,3}$ and $x^2_{1,3}x^2_{2,4}$. We explicitly verify our conjecture by computing the loop-forms in terms of a basis of planar conformal integrals up to $\ell=3$, which indeed yield correct loop integrands for the four-point correlator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

      <title>Electric/magnetic duality of dyonic Kerr-Newman-NUT-AdS spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the (anti-)self-duality conditions under which the electric and magnetic parts of the conserved charges of the dyonic Kerr-Newman-NUT-AdS solution become equivalent. Within a holographic framework, the stress tensor and the boundary Cotton tensor are computed from the electric/magnetic content of the Weyl tensor. The holographic stress tensor/Cotton tensor duality is recovered along the (anti-)self-dual curve in parameter space. We show that the latter not only implies a duality relation for the mass but also for the angular momentum. The partition function is computed to first order in the saddle-point approximation and a BPS bound is obtained. The ground state of the theory is enlarged to all the (anti-)self-dual configurations when the $SO(4)$ and $U(1)$ Pontryagin densities are introduced. We demonstrate this at the level of the action and variations thereof.</description>

      <title>Musings on SVD and pseudo entanglement entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy are generalizations of the entanglement entropy that involve post-selection. In this work we analyze their properties as measures on the spaces of quantum states and argue that their excess provides useful characterization of a difference between two (i.e. pre-selected and post-selected) states, which shares certain features and in certain cases can be identified as a metric. In particular, when applied to link complement states that are associated to topological links via Chern-Simons theory, these generalized entropies and their excess provide a novel quantification of a difference between corresponding links. We discuss the dependence of such entropy measures on the level of Chern-Simons theory and determine their asymptotic values for certain link states. We find that imaginary part of the pseudo-entropy is sensitive to, and can diagnose chirality of knots. We also consider properties of these entropy measures for simpler quantum mechanical systems, such as generalized SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states, and tripartite GHZ and W states.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave forms for extreme mass ratio collisions from supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the wave form emitted by a particle moving along an arbitrary (in general open) geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. The mathematical problem can be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT correspondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian expansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational coefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and exponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the orbital quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$. For $\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that our results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in the Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the so-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our approach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave form that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\omega^{n-1} (\log \omega)^n$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions from conformal field theory: generalized $\phi^{2n+1}$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $\phi^{2n+1}$ deformations of the generalized free theory in the $\epsilon$ expansion, where the canonical kinetic term is generalized to a higher-derivative version. For $n=1$, we use the conformal multiplet recombination method to determine the leading anomalous dimensions of the fundamental scalar operator $\phi$ and the bilinear composite operators $\mathcal J$. Then we extend the $n=1$ analysis to the Potts model with $S_{N+1}$ symmetry and its higher-derivative generalization, in which $\phi$ is promoted to an $N$-component field. We further examine the Chew-Frautschi plots and their $N$ dependence. However, for each integer $n&gt;1$, the leading anomalous dimensions of $\phi$ and $ \mathcal{J}$ are not fully determined and contain one unconstrained constant, which in the canonical cases can be fixed by the results from the traditional diagrammatic method. In all cases, we verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with crossing symmetry using the analytic bootstrap methods.</description>

      <title>Bulk Reconstruction and Gauge Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the concept of bulk reconstruction, which involves mapping bulk operators into CFT operators to understand the emergence of spacetime and gravity. We argue that the $N=\infty$ approximation fails to capture crucial aspects of gravity, as it does not respect gauge invariance and lacks direct connections between energy and boundary metrics. Key concepts such as entanglement wedge reconstruction and holographic error correction codes, which are based on the $N=\infty$ theory, may be incorrect or require significant revision when finite $N$ effects are considered. We present explicit examples demonstrating discrepancies in bulk reconstructions and suggest that a gauge-invariant approach is necessary for an accurate understanding.</description>

      <title>Geometrically constrained sine-Gordon field: BPS solitons and their collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an enlarged $(1+1)$-dimensional model with two real scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$ whose scalar potential $V(\phi,\chi)$ has a standard $\chi^4$ sector and a sine-Gordon one for $\phi$. These fields are coupled through a generalizing function $f(\chi)$ that appears in the scalar potential and controls the nontrivial dynamics of $\phi$. We minimize the effective energy via the implementation of the BPS technique. We then obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy and the first-order equations whose solutions saturate that bound. We solve these equations for a nontrivial $f(\chi)$. As the result, BPS kinks with internal structures emerge. They exhibit a two-kink profile. i.e. an effect due to geometrical constrictions. We consider the linear stability of these new configurations. In this sense, we study the existence of internal modes that play an important role during the scattering process. We then investigate the kink-antikink collisions, and present the numerical results for the most interesting cases. We also comment about their most relevant features.</description>

      <title>The no boundary density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a no-boundary proposal for a subregion of the universe. In the classical approximation, this density matrix involves finding a specific classical solution of the equations of motion with no boundary. Beyond the usual no boundary condition at early times, we also have another no boundary condition in the region we trace out. We can find the prescription by starting from the usual Hartle-Hawking proposal for the wavefunction on a full slice and tracing out the unobserved region in the classical approximation. We discuss some specific subregions and compute the corresponding solutions. These geometries lead to phenomenologically unacceptable probabilities, as expected.
  We also discuss how the usual Coleman de Luccia bubble solutions can be interpreted as a possible no boundary contribution to the density matrix of the universe. These geometries lead to local (but not global) maxima of the probability that are phenomenologically acceptable.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the specific heat at constant pressure, the specific heat at constant volume, the trace anomaly, the thermal diffusion constant and the isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Superhorizon Curvature Perturbations Are Protected against One-Loop Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine one-loop corrections from small-scale curvature perturbations to the superhorizon-limit ones in single-field inflation models, which have recently caused controversy. We consider the case where the Universe experiences transitions of slow-roll (SR) $\to$ intermediate period $\to$ SR. The intermediate period can be an ultra-slow-roll period or a resonant amplification period, either of which enhances small-scale curvature perturbations. We assume that the superhorizon curvature perturbations are conserved at least during each of the SR periods. Within this framework, we show that the superhorizon curvature perturbations during the first and the second SR periods coincide at one-loop level in the slow-roll limit.</description>

      <title>Rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to rotation, the mass correction of neutron stars arises and causes the rotational mass to be larger than the static mass. In this work, we extend the formulation of the rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity. We apply numerical simulation on the formulation we obtained. We refer to mass of J0740+6620, GW170817, and GW190814 as the mass constraints of the neutron stars. For the free parameters, we use three values of Rastall's parameter, i.e. $\lambda=0.00019$, $\lambda=0.00038$, $\lambda=0.00071$; and three values of anisotropic strength, i.e. $\zeta=-1.15$, $\zeta=-1.50$, and $\zeta=-2.00$. We have found that both $\lambda$ and $\zeta$ impact on the increment of the NS's rotational mass within the compact regimes, and also impact on the decrease of the NS's rotational mass within the loose regimes. All mass constraints are satisfied by the NS with $\zeta=-2.00$. In term of the moment of inertia $I$ of the neutron stars, all numerical results match with the constraint range which is based on radio observations of heavy pulsars; while in term of the angular velocity of the stars relative to the distant observers $\Omega$, the mass correction $\delta M$ significantly increases when $\Omega$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat the guiding-center dynamics in a varying external Maxwell field using a relativistically covariant action principle which reproduces the known Vandervoort expression for the drift velocity and extends it to curved spacetime. We derive the corresponding kinetic theory and ideal hydrodynamic theory. In contrast to conventional five-equation hydrodynamics, the guiding-center hydrodynamics needs only three equations due to a constraint on the motion across magnetic field. We argue that such a hydrodynamics is applicable to strongly coupled plasmas where kinetic theory fails.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar clouds and black hole spacetimes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study static black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity with a massive scalar field as an example of higher curvature gravity. The scalar mass introduces an additional scale and leads to a strong suppression of the scalar field beyond its Compton wavelength. We numerically compute sGB black hole spacetimes and scalar configurations and also compare with perturbative results for small couplings, where we focus on a dilatonic coupling function. We analyze the constraints on the parameters from requiring the curvature singularity to be located inside the black hole horizon $r_h$ and the relation to the regularity condition for the scalar field. For scalar field masses $m r_h \gtrsim 10^{-1}$, this leads to a new and currently most stringent bound on sGB coupling constant $\alpha$ of $\alpha/r_h^2 \sim 10^{-1}$ in the context of stellar mass black holes. Lastly, we look at several properties of the black hole configurations relevant for further work on observational consequences, including the scalar monopole charge, Arnowitt Deser Misner mass, curvature invariants and the frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit and light ring.</description>

Abstract: Wave equations for some curved spacetimes may involve functions that prevent a solution in a closed form. In some cases, these functions can be eliminated by transformations and the solutions can be found analytically. In the cases where such transformations are not available, the infinite series expansions of these functions can be convoluted with the power series solution ansatz. We study such an example where the solution is based on a special function.</description>

      <title>Volichenko-type metasymmetry of braided Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents different mathematical structures connected with the parastatistics of braided Majorana qubits and clarifies their role; in particular, mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras belong to a more general framework than the Volichenko algebras defined in 1990 by Leites-Serganova as metasymmetries which do not respect even/odd gradings and lead to mixed brackets interpolating ordinary commutators and anticommutators. In a previous paper braided $Z_2$-graded Majorana qubits were first-quantized within a graded Hopf algebra framework endowed with a braided tensor product. The resulting system admits truncations at roots of unity and realizes, for a given integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$, an interpolation between ordinary Majorana fermions (recovered at $s=2$) and bosons (recovered in the $s\rightarrow \infty$ limit); it implements a parastatistics where at most $s-1$ indistinguishable particles are accommodated in a multi-particle sector. The structures discussed in this work are: - the quantum group interpretation of the roots of unity truncations recovered from reps of the quantum superalgebra ${\cal U}_q({{osp}}(1|2))$; - the reconstruction, via suitable intertwining operators, of the braided tensor products as ordinary tensor products; - the introduction of mixed brackets for the braided creation/annihilation operators which define generalized Heisenberg-Lie algebras; - the $s\rightarrow \infty$ untruncated limit of the mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras producing parafermionic oscillators; - (meta)symmetries of ordinary differential equations given by matrix Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $0+1$ dimension induced by the braided creation/annihilation operators; - in the special case of a third root of unity truncation, a nonminimal realization of the intertwining operators defines the system as a ternary algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bounce solutions and associated negative modes in the class of piecewise linear triangular-shaped potentials that may be viewed as approximations of smooth potentials. In these simple potentials, the bounce solution and action can be obtained analytically for a general spacetime dimension $D$. The eigenequations for the fluctuations around the bounce are universal and have the form of a Schr\"odinger-like equation with delta-function potentials. This Schr\"odinger equation is solved exactly for the negative modes whose number is confirmed to be one. The latter result may justify the usefulness of such piecewise linear potentials in the study of false vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of magnetized black holes and topological stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linear response of four dimensional magnetized black holes and regular topological stars arising from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions. We consider both radial and nonradial perturbations and study the stability of these solutions, both in the frequency and in the time domain. Due to the presence of magnetic fluxes in the background, axial (i.e., odd-parity) gravitational perturbations are coupled to polar (i.e., even-parity) electromagnetic perturbations (Type-I sector) whereas polar gravitational and scalar perturbations are coupled to axial electromagnetic ones (Type-II sector). We provide a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of the radial perturbations and of the Type I sector, finding no evidence of linear instabilities (besides the already known Gregory-Laflamme instability of black strings occurring only in a certain range of the parameters), even despite the fact that the effective potential for radial perturbations of topological stars is negative and divergent near the inner boundary. Ultracompact topological stars exhibit long-lived trapped modes that give rise to echoes in the time-domain response. Their prompt response is very similar to that of the corresponding black hole with comparable charge-to-mass ratio. This provides a concrete realization of ultracompact objects arising from a well-defined theory. The numerical analysis of the Type-II sector will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Energy change and Landauer's principle in the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a general description of the system evolution under the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory up to the second order perturbation, which is also referred to as the simplified model of light-matter interaction. The results are classified into rotating and counter-rotating wave terms, the former corresponding to stimulated absorption and emission, and the latter to Unruh and anti-Unruh effects. We obtain not only the reduced density matrix of the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the environment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field theory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the expectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the temporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the conventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a "temperature", which raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer's principle. We prove that Landauer's principle still holds for any state of motion.</description>

      <title>Trace Anomaly in Metric-Affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the trace (Weyl) anomaly within a general metric-affine geometry that includes both torsion and nonmetricity. Using the Heat Kernel method and Seeley's algorithm, we compute the Minakshisundaram coefficients for arbitrary spacetimes within this framework, incorporating the effects of the nonmetricity and torsion tensors for the first time. We then determine the corrections to the trace anomaly at one loop for the matter sector in theories invariant under conformal transformation, frame rescaling transformation, and projective transformation. We identify a new anomaly related to hypermomentum, arising from the dilation part mediated by the Weyl component of nonmetricity. As particular cases, we analyze the spin $0$ and spin $1/2$ cases, considering various couplings between matter and the gravitational sector. We demonstrate that invariance under the frame rescaling transformation results in an anomaly in the relationship between the hypermomentum and the stress-energy tensor. In contrast, under the projective transformation, no anomaly is present; specifically, there is no non-zero trace of the hypermomentum tensor in any of our concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Exact Results On the Number of Gravitons Radiated During Binary Inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula $F(e) = 2 \hbar \frac{dN}{dJ}$ which provides a concrete estimate for the total number and angular momentum of gravitons emitted during the nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes. We show that the function $F(e)$ is a slowly growing monotonic function of the eccentricity $0 \le e \le 1$ and $F(1) = 1.0128 \cdots $. We confirm and extend the results of Page for the function $F(e)$. We also get an exact result for the ratio $\nu (e_i) = \frac{2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)}{L_i}$ of the sum of the spin angular momentum magnitudes of gravitons emitted to the magnitude $L_i$ of the total angular momentum emitted in the graviational waves by inspiraling binary black holes. If the orbit starts off with unit eccentricity $e_i=1$, we get the exact value $\nu(1) = 1.002\, 268\, 666\, 2 \pm 10^{-10}$ which confirms the Page conjecture. We also show that the formula $F(e)$ for gravitons emitted can be determined by a single function.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Shadows of Black Holes in $f(R,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore two $f(R,T)$ gravity models and derive black hole solutions within these models. We focus on investigating how the $f(R,T)$ model influences the thermodynamic characteristics of black holes by studying their thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry. We consider five specific values of the thermodynamic parameter $\omega$, which signify five different classes of black hole solutions in general relativity (GR). We observe significant changes in the local topological properties of these black holes compared to GR, depending on the model parameters. Notably, we identify an additional topological class $W=0$ for some values of $\omega$ that is absent in the GR framework. We also study the thermodynamic geometry of the black hole using the Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) formalism. Our analysis demonstrates that the singular point, where the GTD scalar curvature diverges, corresponds exactly to the point where the heat capacity changes sign. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters of both models considered by utilizing black hole shadow data from the Sgr A* black hole, measured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>
