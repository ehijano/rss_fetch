      <title>Assessing the Dosimetric Effects of High-Z Titanium Implants in Proton Therapy Using Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally examines the effect and changes in the delivered fields, using water-equivalent phantoms with and without titanium (Ti) dental implants positioned along the primary beam path. We measure in detail the composition and spectral-tracking characterization of particles generated in the entrance region of the Bragg curve using high-spatial resolution, spectral and time-sensitive imaging detectors with a pixelated array provided by the ASIC chip Timepix3. A 170 MeV proton beam was collimated and modulated in a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Placing two dental implants at the end of the protons range in the phantom, the radiation was measured using two pixeled detectors with Si sensors. The Timepix3 (TPX3) detectors equipped with silicon sensors measure in detail particle fluxes, dose rates (DR) and linear energy transfer (LET) spectra for resolved particle types. Artificial intelligence (AI) based-trained neural networks (NN) calibrated in well-defined radiation fields were used to analyze and identify particles based on morphology and characteristic spectral-tracking response. The beam was characterized and single-particle tracks were registered and decomposed into particle-type groups. The resulting particle fluxes in both setups are resolved into three main classes of particles: i) protons, ii) electrons and photons iii) ions. Protons are the main particle component responsible for dose deposition. High-energy transfer particles (HETP), namely ions exhibited differences in both dosimetric aspects that were investigated: DR and particle fluxes, when the Ti implants were placed in the setup. The detailed multi-parametric information of the secondary radiation field provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Ti materials in proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing beta-amyloid PET images from T1-weighted Structural MRI: A Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beta-amyloid positron emission tomography (A$\beta$-PET) imaging has become a critical tool in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and diagnosis, providing insights into the pathological accumulation of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of AD. However, the high cost, limited availability, and exposure to radioactivity restrict the widespread use of A$\beta$-PET imaging, leading to a scarcity of comprehensive datasets. Previous studies have suggested that structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is more readily available, may serve as a viable alternative for synthesizing A$\beta$-PET images. In this study, we propose an approach to utilize 3D diffusion models to synthesize A$\beta$-PET images from T1-weighted MRI scans, aiming to overcome the limitations associated with direct PET imaging. Our method generates high-quality A$\beta$-PET images for cognitive normal cases, although it is less effective for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients due to the variability in A$\beta$ deposition patterns among subjects. Our preliminary results suggest that incorporating additional data, such as a larger sample of MCI cases and multi-modality information including clinical and demographic details, cognitive and functional assessments, and longitudinal data, may be necessary to improve A$\beta$-PET image synthesis for MCI patients.</description>

      <title>Zero-echo-time sequences in highly inhomogeneous fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero echo time (ZTE) sequences have proven a powerful tool for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of ultrashort T2 tissues, but they fail to produce useful images in the presence of strong field inhomogeneities. Here we present a method to correct artifacts induced by strong B0 inhomogeneities in non-Cartesian sequences, based on magnetic field maps obtained from the phase difference between two fast pointwise acquisitions. These are free of geometric distortions and can be used for model based image reconstruction with iterative algebraic techniques. In this paper, we show that distortions and artifacts coming from inhomogeneites in B0 are largely reverted by our method, as opposed to standard Conjugate Phase reconstructions. We base this technique on a Single-Point Double-Shot (SPDS) approach, and we have shown it to work even for intra-voxel bandwidths (determined by B0 inhomogeneities) comparable to the encoding bandwidth (determined by the gradient fields). We benchmark the performance of SPDS for ZTE acquisitions, which can be exploited for e.g. dental imaging in affordable low-field MRI systems. Furthermore, SPDS can be used for arbitrary pulse sequences and it may prove useful for extreme magnet geometries, as in e.g. single-sided MRI.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
