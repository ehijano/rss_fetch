      <title>Colored Gaussian DAG models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study submodels of Gaussian DAG models defined by partial homogeneity constraints imposed on the model error variances and structural coefficients. We represent these models with colored DAGs and investigate their properties for use in statistical and causal inference. Local and global Markov properties are provided and shown to characterize the colored DAG model. Additional properties relevant to causal discovery are studied, including the existence and non-existence of faithful distributions and structural identifiability. Extending prior work of Peters and B\"uhlman and Wu and Drton, we prove structural identifiability under the assumption of homogeneous structural coefficients, as well as for a family of models with partially homogenous structural coefficients. The latter models, termed BPEC-DAGs, capture additional insights as they cluster the direct causes of each node into communities according to their effect on their common target. An analogue of the GES algorithm for learning BPEC-DAGs is given and evaluated on real and synthetic data. Regarding model geometry, we prove that these models are contractible, smooth, algebraic manifolds and compute their dimension. We also provide a proof of a conjecture of Sullivant which generalizes to colored DAG models, colored undirected graphical models and ancestral graph models.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of the Normal Distribution in Deterministic Chaotic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem states that, in the limit of a large number of terms, an appropriately scaled sum of independent random variables yields another random variable whose probability distribution tends to a stable distribution. The condition of independence, however, only holds in real systems as an approximation. To extend the theorem to more general situations, previous studies have derived a version of the Central Limit Theorem that also holds for variables that are not independent. Here, we present numerical results that characterize how convergence is attained when the variables being summed are deterministically related to one another by the recurrent application of an ergodic mapping. In all the explored cases, the convergence to the limit distribution is slower than for random sampling. Yet, the speed at which convergence is attained varies substantially from system to system, and these variations imply differences in the way information about the deterministic nature of the dynamics is progressively lost as the number of summands increases. Some of the identified factors in shaping the convergence process are the strength of mixing induced by the mapping and the shape of the marginal distribution of each variable, most particularly, the presence of divergences or fat tails.</description>

      <title>The ESPRIT algorithm under high noise: Optimal error scaling and noisy super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subspace-based signal processing techniques, such as the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, are popular methods for spectral estimation. These algorithms can achieve the so-called super-resolution scaling under low noise conditions, surpassing the well-known Nyquist limit. However, the performance of these algorithms under high-noise conditions is not as well understood. Existing state-of-the-art analysis indicates that ESPRIT and related algorithms can be resilient even for signals where each observation is corrupted by statistically independent, mean-zero noise of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but these analyses only show that the error $\epsilon$ decays at a slow rate $\epsilon=\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ with respect to the cutoff frequency $n$. In this work, we prove that under certain assumptions of bias and high noise, the ESPRIT algorithm can attain a significantly improved error scaling $\epsilon = \mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-3/2})$, exhibiting noisy super-resolution scaling beyond the Nyquist limit. We further establish a theoretical lower bound and show that this scaling is optimal. Our analysis introduces novel matrix perturbation results, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Bayesian high-dimensional covariate selection in non-linear mixed-effects models using the SAEM algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01012v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional variable selection, with many more covariates than observations, is widely documented in standard regression models, but there are still few tools to address it in non-linear mixed-effects models where data are collected repeatedly on several individuals. In this work, variable selection is approached from a Bayesian perspective and a selection procedure is proposed, combining the use of a spike-and-slab prior and the Stochastic Approximation version of the Expectation Maximisation (SAEM) algorithm. Similarly to Lasso regression, the set of relevant covariates is selected by exploring a grid of values for the penalisation parameter. The SAEM approach is much faster than a classical MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm and our method shows very good selection performances on simulated data. Its flexibility is demonstrated by implementing it for a variety of nonlinear mixed effects models. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated on a problem of genetic markers identification, relevant for genomic-assisted selection in plant breeding.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic uniqueness in long-term prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the asymptotic uniqueness of long-term probability forecasts in the following form. Consider two forecasters who repeatedly issue probability forecasts for the infinite future. The main result of the paper says that either at least one of the two forecasters will be discredited or their forecasts will converge in total variation. This can be regarded as a game-theoretic version of the classical Blackwell-Dubins result getting rid of some of its limitations. This result is further strengthened along the lines of Richard Jeffrey's radical probabilism.</description>

      <title>The numeraire e-variable and reverse information projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider testing a composite null hypothesis $\mathcal{P}$ against a point alternative $\mathsf{Q}$ using e-variables, which are nonnegative random variables $X$ such that $\mathbb{E}_\mathsf{P}[X] \leq 1$ for every $\mathsf{P} \in \mathcal{P}$. This paper establishes a fundamental result: under no conditions whatsoever on $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathsf{Q}$, there exists a special e-variable $X^*$ that we call the numeraire, which is strictly positive and satisfies $\mathbb{E}_\mathsf{Q}[X/X^*] \leq 1$ for every other e-variable $X$. In particular, $X^*$ is log-optimal in the sense that $\mathbb{E}_\mathsf{Q}[\log(X/X^*)] \leq 0$. Moreover, $X^*$ identifies a particular sub-probability measure $\mathsf{P}^*$ via the density $d \mathsf{P}^*/d \mathsf{Q} = 1/X^*$. As a result, $X^*$ can be seen as a generalized likelihood ratio of $\mathsf{Q}$ against $\mathcal{P}$. We show that $\mathsf{P}^*$ coincides with the reverse information projection (RIPr) when additional assumptions are made that are required for the latter to exist. Thus $\mathsf{P}^*$ is a natural definition of the RIPr in the absence of any assumptions on $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathsf{Q}$. In addition to the abstract theory, we provide several tools for finding the numeraire and RIPr in concrete cases. We discuss several nonparametric examples where we can indeed identify the numeraire and RIPr, despite not having a reference measure. Our results have interpretations outside of testing in that they yield the optimal Kelly bet against $\mathcal{P}$ if we believe reality follows $\mathsf{Q}$. We end with a more general optimality theory that goes beyond the ubiquitous logarithmic utility. We focus on certain power utilities, leading to reverse R\'enyi projections in place of the RIPr, which also always exist.</description>

      <title>Monotone additive statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00618v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expectation is an example of a descriptive statistic that is monotone with respect to stochastic dominance, and additive for sums of independent random variables. We provide a complete characterization of such statistics, and explore a number of applications to models of individual and group decision-making. These include a representation of stationary monotone time preferences, extending the work of Fishburn and Rubinstein (1982) to time lotteries. This extension offers a new perspective on risk attitudes toward time, as well as on the aggregation of multiple discount factors. We also offer a novel class of nonexpected utility preferences over gambles which satisfy invariance to background risk as well as betweenness, but are versatile enough to capture mixed risk attitudes.</description>

      <title>Individualized Dynamic Model for Multi-resolutional Data with Application to Mobile Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile health has emerged as a major success for tracking individual health status, due to the popularity and power of smartphones and wearable devices. This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</description>
