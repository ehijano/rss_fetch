      <title>Fine-Tuning Hydrophilic-Hydrophobic Balance in Stimuli-Responsive PEGPNIPAM Micelles for Controlled Drug Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature-responsive polymeric micelles have great potential in drug delivery, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. This study investigates the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PEG-PNIPAM) block copolymers as nanocarriers for Doxorubicin (DOX) using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. We systematically examined the effects of polymer chain length and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance on micelle formation, stability, and drug encapsulation efficiency. PEG-PNIPAM copolymers self-assembled above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), forming stable micelles with varying morphologies. Our findings revealed that PEG enhances micelle hydration and stability, while PNIPAM improves drug retention but may hinder controlled release. Increasing PNIPAM or PEG length significantly increased micelle size, with DOX preferentially localizing in the PEG-rich outer shell, enhancing solubility and preventing aggregation. The DOX diffusion coefficient ranged from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$, reflecting drug release dynamics. Structural and thermodynamic analyses confirmed spontaneous DOX encapsulation, with PEG-PNIPAM micelles providing a favorable environment for drug loading. Mean square displacement (MSD), radial distribution function (RDF), and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) analyses highlighted the role of PEG in controlled drug release and PNIPAM in drug binding. These molecular-level insights underscore the potential of fine-tuning PEG-PNIPAM compositions for enhanced drug delivery, paving the way for precision cancer therapies.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Directional Depth Electrodes: Open-Source FEM Lead-Field Modeling, Characterization, and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth electrodes used in stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) and deep-brain stimulation (DBS) are essential tools for neural recording and stimulation. Traditional designs have limited spatial resolution, typically 8 to 16 cylindrical contacts (0.8 to 1.0 mm diameter) along a 5 to 10 cm shaft, restricting recordings from small or localized populations. Recent high-density, directional electrodes (HDsEEG) enable finer localization of local field potentials (LFPs) and spike timing. Yet, characterizing their directional sensitivity and validating modeling tools for lead field (LF) analysis remain critical. We compare finite element method (FEM) LF modeling of a novel HD-sEEG electrode using two tools: a commercial solver (ANSYS) and an open-source pipeline (Brainstorm-DUNEuro). Goals: (i) validate against analytical solutions, (ii) assess solver differences, and (iii) characterize HDsEEG directional sensitivity. LFs were modeled in simple and bio-relevant scenarios. Using Helmholtz reciprocity, we computed LFs by (a) electrode-based stimulation with ANSYS and (b) source-based recording with Brainstorm-DUNEuro. First, a multi-sphere head model with known solutions tested the solver's accuracy. Next, an HDsEEG electrode in a homogeneous conductor was simulated. Directional effects were assessed by comparing sensitivity with vs. without the insulating substrate. Source localization performance was also compared between HDsEEG and standard electrodes. Both solvers closely matched analytic solutions. In realistic settings, LF distributions were highly similar. Modeling showed clear directional sensitivity: contacts facing a source had higher sensitivity than those shadowed, reflecting a substrate shielding effect that vanished when the substrate was conductive. Crucially, HDsEEG improved source localization, as voltage differences across contacts provided robust directional LF information.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Forward and Back-Projector for Rigid Motion Estimation in X-ray Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: In this work, we propose a framework for differentiable forward and back-projector that enables scalable, accurate, and memory-efficient gradient computation for rigid motion estimation tasks. Methods: Unlike existing approaches that rely on auto-differentiation or that are restricted to specific projector types, our method is based on a general analytical gradient formulation for forward/backprojection in the continuous domain. A key insight is that the gradients of both forward and back-projection can be expressed directly in terms of the forward and back-projection operations themselves, providing a unified gradient computation scheme across different projector types. Leveraging this analytical formulation, we develop a discretized implementation with an acceleration strategy that balances computational speed and memory usage. Results: Simulation studies illustrate the numerical accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for multiple X-ray imaging tasks we conducted. In 2D/3D registration, the proposed method achieves ~8x speedup over an existing differentiable forward projector while maintaining comparable accuracy. In motion-compensated analytical reconstruction and cone-beam CT geometry calibration, the proposed method enhances image sharpness and structural fidelity on real phantom data while showing significant efficiency advantages over existing gradient-free and gradient-based solutions. Conclusion: The proposed differentiable projectors enable effective and efficient gradient-based solutions for X-ray imaging tasks requiring rigid motion estimation.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized light scattering imaging of a cancerous layer creeping under a healthy layer for the diagnosis of early-stage cervical cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancerous tissues beneath healthy tissues were experimentally identified by using circularly polarized light scattering. This method enabled the changes in the size of the cell nuclei within the penetration depth in tissue to be investigated. Artificial unexposed cancerous tissues were prepared that consisted of healthy/cancerous/healthy layers with various thicknesses of the topmost healthy layer and the cancerous layer. A polarization imaging camera with a quarter-wave plate was used to create distribution images of the circular polarization of the scattered light, which indicated the presence and depth of cancerous tissues that had crept under the epithelium. These findings will lead to the development of a non-invasive optical diagnostic method for early-stage cervical cancer.</description>

      <title>Optimization of continuous-wave NIRS devices for placental monitoring. A simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optical technique that is widely used to monitor tissue oxygenation. These devices take advantage of the near infrared light to monitor deep tissues like brain, muscle or placenta. In this study, we developed a Monte Carlo framework to evaluate the sensitivity of continuous-wave (CW) NIRS devices for monitoring the placenta which a deep layer in the maternal abdomen. This framework can be used to optimize CW-NIRS acquisition parameters (integration time, source detector separation) before going into clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Electromagnetic Interference in ultra-low noise Bimodal MEG &amp; EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-channel SQUID system technology, operating at a noise level of 100s of aT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$, enables the non-invasive detection of synchronized spiking activity at the single-trial level via magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, when combined with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, the noise performance of the ultrasensitive MEG system can be greatly diminished. This issue negates some of the complementary qualities of these two recording methods. In addition, typical electrical components required for electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, a common method for evoking specific brain responses, are also observed to have a detrimental influence on ultra-low MEG noise performance. These effects are caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and typically preclude single-trial detection. This work outlines, how careful design allows a significant reduction of the impact of EMI when these different electronic systems are operated concurrently. This optimization enabled the simultaneous single-trial detection of synchronized spiking activity using these two highly sensitive recording modalities.</description>

      <title>Development of a defacing algorithm to protect the privacy of head and neck cancer patients in publicly-accessible radiotherapy datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: The rise in public medical imaging datasets has raised concerns about patient reidentification from head CT scans. However, existing defacing algorithms often remove or distort Organs at Risk (OARs) and Planning Target Volumes (PTVs) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, and ignore DICOM-RT Structure Set and Dose data. Therefore, we developed and validated a novel automated defacing algorithm that preserves these critical structures while removing identifiable features from HNC CTs and DICOM-RT data.
  Methods: Eye contours were used as landmarks to automate the removal of CT pixels above the inferior-most eye slice and anterior to the eye midpoint. Pixels within PTVs were retained if they intersected with the removed region. The body contour and dose map were reshaped to reflect the defaced image. We validated our approach on 829 HNC CTs from 622 patients. Privacy protection was evaluated by applying the FaceNet512 facial recognition algorithm before and after defacing on 3D-rendered CT pairs from 70 patients. Research utility was assessed by examining the impact of defacing on autocontouring performance using LimbusAI and analyzing PTV locations relative to the defaced regions.
  Results: Before defacing, FaceNet512 matched 97% of patients' CTs. After defacing, this rate dropped to 4%. LimbusAI effectively autocontoured organs in the defaced CTs, with perfect Dice scores of 1 for OARs below the defaced region, and excellent scores exceeding 0.95 for OARs on the same slices as the crop. We found that 86% of PTVs were entirely below the cropped region, 9.1% were on the same slice as the crop without overlap, and only 4.9% extended into the cropped area.
  Conclusions: We developed a novel defacing algorithm that anonymizes HNC CT scans and related DICOM-RT data while preserving essential structures, enabling the sharing of HNC imaging datasets for Big Data and AI.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Methods and Computational Strategies for Pseudoinverse-Based MR Image Reconstruction (Pinv-Recon)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image reconstruction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is fundamentally a linear inverse problem, such that the image can be recovered via explicit pseudoinversion of the encoding matrix by solving $\textbf{data} = \textbf{Encode} \times \textbf{image}$ - a method referred to here as Pinv-Recon. While the benefits of this approach were acknowledged in early studies, the field has historically favored fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and iterative techniques due to perceived computational limitations of the pseudoinversion approach. This work revisits Pinv-Recon in the context of modern hardware, software, and optimized linear algebra routines. We compare various matrix inversion strategies, assess regularization effects, and demonstrate incorporation of advanced encoding physics into a unified reconstruction framework. While hardware advances have already significantly reduced computation time compared to earlier studies, our work further demonstrates that leveraging Cholesky decomposition leads to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over previous Singular Value Decomposition-based implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of Pinv-Recon on diverse $\textit{in vivo}$ datasets encompassing a range of encoding schemes, starting with low- to medium-resolution functional and metabolic imaging and extending to high-resolution cases. Our findings establish Pinv-Recon as a versatile and robust reconstruction framework that aligns with the increasing emphasis on open-source and reproducible MRI research.</description>

      <title>Functional Ultrasound Imaging Combined with Machine Learning for Whole-Brain Analysis of Drug-Induced Hemodynamic Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a cutting-edge technology that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) by detecting backscattered echoes from red blood cells moving within its field of view (FOV). It offers high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity, allowing for detailed visualization of cerebral blood flow dynamics. While fUSI has been utilized in preclinical drug development studies to explore the mechanisms of action of various drugs targeting the central nervous system, many of these studies rely on predetermined regions of interest (ROIs). This focus may overlook relevant brain activity outside these specific areas, which could influence the results. To address this limitation, we compared three machine learning approaches-convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and vision transformer (ViT)-combined with fUSI to analyze the pharmacodynamics of Dizocilpine (MK-801), a potent non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist commonly used in preclinical models for memory and learning impairments. While all three machine learning techniques could distinguish between drug and control conditions, CNN proved particularly effective due to their ability to capture hierarchical spatial features while maintaining anatomical specificity. Class activation mapping revealed brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, that are significantly affected by drug administration, consistent with the literature reporting a high density of NMDA receptors in these areas. Overall, the combination of fUSI and CNN creates a novel analytical framework for examining pharmacological mechanisms, allowing for data-driven identification and regional mapping of drug effects while preserving anatomical context and physiological relevance.</description>

      <title>UltraDfeGAN: Detail-Enhancing Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Fidelity Functional Ultrasound Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging technique known for its high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling non-invasive observation of brain activity through neurovascular coupling. Despite its potential in clinical applications such as neonatal monitoring and intraoperative guidance, the development of fUS faces challenges related to data scarcity and limitations in generating realistic fUS images. This paper explores the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework tailored for fUS image synthesis. The proposed method incorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules and normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological plausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the framework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to produce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions. Additionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in downstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for data augmentation. Experimental results are based on publicly available fUS datasets, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing data limitations.</description>
