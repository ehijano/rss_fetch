      <title>Coordinate-free utility theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard decision theory seeks conditions under which a preference relation can be compressed into a single real-valued function. However, when preferences are incomplete or intransitive, a single function fails to capture the agent's evaluative structure. Recent literature on multi-utility representations suggests that such preferences are better represented by families of functions. This paper provides a canonical and intrinsic geometric characterization of this family. We construct the \textit{ledger group} $U(P)$, a partially ordered group that faithfully encodes the native structure of the agent's preferences in terms of trade-offs. We show that the set of all admissible utility functions is precisely the \textit{dual cone} $U^*$ of this structure. This perspective shifts the focus of utility theory from the existence of a specific map to the geometry of the measurement space itself. We demonstrate the power of this framework by explicitly reconstructing the standard multi-attribute utility representation as the intersection of the abstract dual cone with a subspace of continuous functionals, and showing the impossibility of this for a set of lexicographic preferences.</description>

      <title>Competition for being visited first and ordered search deterrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When customers must visit a seller to learn the valuation of its product, sellers potentially benefit from charging a lower price on the first visit and a higher price when a buyer returns. Armstrong and Zhou (2016) show that such price discrimination can arise in equilibrium when buyers learn a seller's pricing policy only upon visiting. We depart from this assumption by supposing that sellers commit to observable pricing policies that guide consumer search and buyers can choose whom to visit first. We show that no seller engages in price discrimination in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Robust procurement design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study procurement design when the buyer is uncertain about both the value of the good and the seller's cost. The buyer has a conjectured model but does not fully trust it. She first identifies mechanisms that maximize her worst-case payoff over a set of plausible models, and then selects one from this set that maximizes her expected payoff under the conjectured model. Robustness leads the buyer to increase procurement from the least efficient sellers and reduce it from those with intermediate costs. We also study monopoly regulation and identify conditions under which quantity regulation outperforms price regulation.</description>

      <title>Platform Competition with User-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical model of platform competition where user-generated content (UGC) quality arises endogenously from the composition of the user base. Users differ in their relative preferences for content quality and network size, and platforms compete by choosing advertising intensity, which affects user utility through perceived quality. We characterize equilibrium platform choice, identifying conditions under which equilibria are stable. The model captures how platforms' strategic decisions shape user allocation and market outcomes, including coexistence and dominance scenarios. We consider two types of equilibria in advertising levels: Nash equilibria and Stackelberg equilibria, and discuss the industry and policy implications of our results.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Strategic Evolution: Games with Endogenous Players and Strategic Replicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops the Theory of Strategic Evolution, a general model for systems in which the population of players, strategies, and institutional rules evolve together. The theory extends replicator dynamics to settings with endogenous players, multi level selection, innovation, constitutional change, and meta governance. The central mathematical object is a Poiesis stack: a hierarchy of strategic layers linked by cross level gain matrices. Under small gain conditions, the system admits a global Lyapunov function and satisfies selection, tracking, and stochastic stability results at every finite depth. We prove that the class is closed under block extension, innovation events, heterogeneous utilities, continuous strategy spaces, and constitutional evolution. The closure theorem shows that no new dynamics arise at higher levels and that unrestricted self modification cannot preserve Lyapunov structure. The theory unifies results from evolutionary game theory, institutional design, innovation dynamics, and constitutional political economy, providing a general mathematical model of long run strategic adaptation.</description>

      <title>Robust Counterfactuals in Centralized Schools Choice Systems: Addressing Gender Inequality in STEM Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual analysis is central to education market design and provides a foundation for credible policy recommendations. We develop a novel methodology for counterfactual analysis in Gale-Shapley deferred-acceptance (DA) assignment mechanisms under a weaker set of assumptions than those typically imposed in existing empirical works. Instead of fully specifying utility functions or students' beliefs about admission probabilities, we rely on interpretable restrictions on behavior that yield an incomplete but flexible model of preferences. This framework addresses the challenge of partial identification by delivering sharp bounds on counterfactual stable matching outcomes, which we compute efficiently using a combination of algorithmic techniques and integer programming. We illustrate the methodology by evaluating policies aimed at increasing female enrollment in STEM fields in Chile.</description>

      <title>Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player game in continuous time, where each player's objective functional depends non-linearly on the expected value of the state process. As a result, the classical Bellman optimality principle no longer applies. To address this, we adopt a two-layer game-theoretic framework and seek sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria both at the intra-personal level, which accounts for time inconsistency, and at the inter-personal level, which captures strategic interactions among players. We first characterise sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria and the corresponding value processes of all players through a system of coupled backward stochastic differential equations. We then analyse the mean-field counterpart and its sub-game--perfect mean-field equilibria, described by a system of McKean-Vlasov backward stochastic differential equations. Building on this representation, we finally prove the convergence of sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria and their corresponding value processes in the $N$-player game to their mean-field counterparts.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Order Flow Auction under Proposer-Builder Separation on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of the order flow auction (OFA) in the context of the proposer-builder separation (PBS) mechanism in blockchains through a game-theoretic perspective. The OFA is designed to improve user welfare by redistributing maximal extractable value (MEV) to the users, in which two sequential auctions take place: the order flow auction and the block-building auction. We formulate the OFA as a multiplayer game, and establish the existence of a Nash equilibrium, and in the two-player case derive a closed-form solution (and prove its uniqueness) via a quartic equation. Our result shows that the builder with a competitive advantage pays a lower cost, leading to a higher revenue, and adding to centralization in the builder space. In contrast, the proposer's shares evolve as a martingale process, which implies decentralization in the proposer/validator space. Our analyses rely on various tools from stochastic processes, convex optimization, and polynomial equations. We also conduct numerical studies to corroborate our findings, and to bring out other features of the OFA under the PBS mechanism.</description>

      <title>Collusion-proof Auction Design using Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of auction design in the presence of bidder collusion. Specifically, we consider a multi-unit auction of identical items with single-minded bidders, where a subset of bidders may collude by coordinating bids and transferring payments and items among themselves. The classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves(VCG) mechanism is highly vulnerable to collusion and fully collusion-proof mechanisms are limited to posted-price formats, which fail to guarantee even approximate efficiency. This paper aims to bridge this gap by designing auctions that achieve good welfare and revenue guarantees even when some bidders collude. We first characterize the strategic behavior of colluding bidders under VCG and prove that such bidders optimally bid shade: they never overbid or take additional items, but instead reduce the auction price. This characterization enables a Bulow-Klemperer type result: adding colluding bidders can only improve welfare and revenue relative to running VCG on the non-colluding group alone. We next consider a setting where black-box collusion detection algorithm is available to label bidders as being colluding or non-colluding, and we propose a VCG-Posted Price(V-PoP) mechanism that combines VCG applied to non-colluding bidders with a posted-price mechanism for colluding bidders. We show that V-PoP is ex-post dominant-strategy incentive compatible(DSIC) and derive probabilistic guarantees on expected welfare and revenue under both known and unknown valuation distributions. Numerical experiments across several distributions demonstrate that V-PoP consistently outperforms VCG restricted to non-colluding bidders and approaches the performance of the ideal VCG mechanism assuming universal truthfulness. Our results provide a principled framework for incorporating collusion detection into mechanism design, offering a step toward collusion-resistant auctions.</description>
