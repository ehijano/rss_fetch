      <title>Learning Science and the Illusion of Understanding: Exploring the Effects of Integrating Learning Tasks after Explainer Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainer videos are increasingly used to support science learning. While prior research has demonstrated their potential, studies have also identified limitations - particularly their tendency to foster an illusion of understanding, where learners overestimate their grasp of a topic despite gaps in their actual knowledge. Pairing explainer videos with cognitively engaging elements may help mitigate this effect. This paper reports two experimental studies examining the immediate and long-term effects of learning tasks following a physics explainer video on learners' illusion of understanding. Study 1 (N = 244 learners) compared high-level learning tasks with watching the video alone. Study 2 (N = 175) compared high-level and low-level tasks. Results show that high-level learning tasks significantly reduce the illusion of understanding immediately after the intervention compared to watching the video alone (t(88) = 6.50, p &lt; .001, d = 0.69). Over the long term, both high-and low-level tasks are similarly effective. Learners with lower prior content knowledge are more susceptible to an illusion of understanding. We conclude that explainer videos should not be used in isolation in science classrooms. To prevent misjudged understanding - particularly among students with limited prior knowledge - they should be combined with cognitively demanding follow-up activities.</description>

      <title>A Critical Analysis of Affirmative Action and Academic Performance: A Response to the Preprint Authored by Matheus et al. (2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article offers a critical response to the preprint by Matheus et al. (2025), which evaluates the academic performance of students admitted through different entry routes at Sao Paulo State University. Although the dataset compiled by the authors is valuable, their analysis contains conceptual, methodological, and historical limitations that undermine the validity of their conclusions. We argue that the preprint misinterprets the purpose of Brazil's affirmative action policy, which is intended to ensure equitable access rather than equalize academic performance at the point of university entry. Early performance differences among universal system, public school, and racial-quota students reflect longstanding inequalities in Brazil's basic education system. Furthermore, the preprint generalizes findings basically from only three undergraduate programs (Physics, Biology, and Pedagogy) to represent entire academic domains (STEM, Biological Sciences, and Humanities), an extrapolation that reduces the reliability of its conclusions. Overall, we contend that early performance differences indicate structural educational inequality, not policy failure. Affirmative action fulfills its mandate by guaranteeing access, while universities bear the responsibility for providing equitable conditions for academic progression.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quantum Soundscapes and Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04624v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe our investigations involving the sonification of data from experiments involving various mesoscopic mechanical oscillator systems cooled to close to their quantum ground states, as well as the sonification of measured data from a single qubit subject to various unitary rotations designed to test the Leggett-Garg inequality. "Listening" to data via their resulting sonifications facilitates the discovery of signals that might otherwise be hard to detect in common graphic (i.e., visual) representations, and for the qubit experiment provides a complementary way to discern when the data violates macroscopic realism with some prior listening training. The resulting soundscapes and music also provide a complementary window into the quantum realm that is accessible to non-experts with open ears.</description>

      <title>A Hands-On Molecular Communication Testbed for Undergraduate Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a hands-on molecular communication (MC) testbed developed for the undergraduate Communication Engineering lab course at the Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), TU~Braunschweig. The goal of the experiment is to provide students with an intuitive and reproducible introduction to MC concepts using a low-cost and accessible fluidic setup. The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.</description>
