      <title>CZT Detectors for kaonic atoms spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors offer excellent room-temperature energy resolution, making them well suited for X- and $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy in challenging environments. Within the SIDDHARTA-2 program at the DA$\Phi$NE collider, a new CZT-based detection system has been developed to enable precision measurements of kaonic atom transitions in the intermediate mass range. In this work, we report the results of a calibration campaign performed with the collider operating, aimed at assessing the detector performance. A dedicated setup, including an array of quasi-hemispherical CZT sensors and a $^{152}$Eu source, was used to characterize the spectral response. The reconstructed emission lines were fitted with a model accounting for Gaussian response and incomplete charge recollection tails, and the detector linearity was evaluated by comparing the measured peak positions with their nominal energies. The results demonstrate that the CZT detector exhibits excellent linearity and stable operation with the collider on, confirming its suitability for future kaonic-atom spectroscopy at DA$\Phi$NE.</description>

      <title>New 1mm thick Silicon Drift Detectors for future researches of Kaonic Atoms and the Pauli Exclusion principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaonic atoms, formed when a negatively charged kaon replaces an electron, provide a sensitive probe of the low-energy strong interaction via precision X-ray spectroscopy. The SIDDHARTA-2 experiment at the DA$\Phi$NE collider employs high-performance Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) optimized for the 4-12 keV range to study light kaonic systems. In preparation for the EXKALIBUR phase, which targets heavier kaonic atoms, new 1 mm-thick SDDs have been developed with Politecnico di Milano and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. Their increased thickness enhances the quantum efficiency by a factor of about two at 30 keV while preserving excellent energy resolution. These detectors are also intended for VIP-3, the next-generation test of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP). Building on VIP-2, which set the most stringent limits on PEP-violating $K_{\alpha}$ transitions in copper, VIP-3 will extend the search to heavier elements such as Ag, Sn, and Zr. Preliminary measurements demonstrate efficient detection up to 30 keV, supporting future high-precision studies of the kaon-nucleon interaction and PEP in heavier systems.</description>

      <title>Position-Sensitive Silicon Photomultiplier Array with Enhanced Position Reconstruction by means of a Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon sensitive detectors like Silicon Photomultipliers are widely used in many medical imaging applications. By using detectors with position resolutions, it is possible to build compact photodetector readouts with reduced number of channels, but still preserving position resolution and gamma-rays imaging capabilities. In this work, we present the advantage of using a Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) light position reconstruction applied to a 2x2 array of linearly-graded SiPMs (LG-SiPMs), to minimize the distortions on the reconstructed event maps. Our approach significantly enhances both the resolution and linearity of position detection compared to the nominal reconstruction formula based on the device architecture. Remarkably, the DNN-based reconstruction boosts the number of resolved areas (pixels) by a factor of at least 5.7, allowing a higher level of precision and performance in light detection.</description>

      <title>Discovery and rectification of an error in high resistance traceability at NPL: a case study in how metrology works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We broach a seldom-discussed topic in precision metrology; how subtle errors in calibration processes are discovered and remedied. We examine a case study at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, involving the calibration of DC standard resistors of value 100 MOhm and 1 GOhm. Results from the period 2001 to 2015 were in error by approximately 0.7 parts per million (ppm), with quoted uncertainties (k=2) of 0.4 ppm and 1.6 ppm respectively. Inter-comparisons did not detect the error, mainly because the uncertainty due to the transportation drift of the comparison standards was too large to resolve it. Likewise, research into single-electron current standards did not detect the error because at this resistance value it was on the borderline of statistical significance. The key event was a comparison between PTB (Germany) and NPL (UK) of a new small-current measuring instrument, the ultrastable low-noise current amplifier (ULCA). At that time, the transport stability of the ULCA was not well established. Nevertheless, calibrations of the ULCA at NPL using a 100 MOhm resistor were sufficiently discrepant with the PTB calibrations to motivate a thorough investigation into the NPL traceability chain, which uncovered the error. This instructive episode illustrates a positive interplay between calibration and research activities and shows that cutting-edge calibration uncertainties must be supported by a vigorous research programme. It is also important for NMIs to maintain a comfortable buffer (at least a factor of 10) between their claimed uncertainty and the uncertainty that their customers require, so that small errors can be resolved without significant impact on measurement stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the LAPPD, a large area microchannel-plate PMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of the LAPPD Gen-II, a large-area microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) equipped with a capacitively coupled sensing (readout) electrode. Two detector variants with different geometries and materials were investigated using a picosecond pulsed laser system. We measured the single-photon timing response and spatial charge distribution on segmented readout electrodes. The prompt timing peak exhibits a resolution of approximately 30 ps, with the overall timing structure explained by photoelectron propagation and back-scattering effects from the MCP input surface. We developed analytical models that describe the propagation of photoelectrons and the induced charge spread on the sensing electrodes, including secondary electron backscattering from the resistive anode. The model accurately reproduces the measured device properties and enables performance extrapolations for various detector geometries and dielectric properties. These results provide a predictive framework for optimizing MCP-PMTs for timing- and imaging-critical applications such as RICH detectors in high-energy physics and TOF-PET systems for medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Searches Using Cryogenic Detectors via Direct Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic detectors are at the forefront of rare-event search experiments, including direct detection of dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and searches for fractionally charged particles. Their unique ability to achieve ultra-low energy thresholds, typically O(eV-100 eV), together with excellent energy resolution and effective background suppression, makes them sensitive to extremely faint signals from rare interactions. These rare particle interactions produce phonons, ionization, or scintillation, depending on the target medium, which are registered by specialized sensors and converted into measurable signals. This review summarizes the underlying detection principles, surveys major experiments and recent results, examines forthcoming initiatives, and outlines the evolving role of cryogenic detectors in advancing the frontiers of rare-event physics.</description>

      <title>Generation of strong ultralow-phase-noise microwave fields with tunable ellipticity for ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave(MW) fields with strong field strength, ultralow phase-noise and tunable polarization are crucial for stabilizing and manipulating ultracold polar molecules, which have emerged as a promising platform for quantum sciences. In this letter, we present the design, characterization, and performance of a robust MW setup tailored for precise control of molecular states. This setup achieves a high electric field intensity of 6.9 kV/m in the near-field from a dual-feed waveguide antenna, enabling a Rabi frequency as high as 71 MHz for the rotational transition of sodium-potassium molecules. In addition, the low noise signal source and controlled electronics provide ultralow phase-noise and dynamically tunable polarization. Narrow-band filters within the MW circuitry further reduce phase-noise by more than 20 dB at 20 MHz offset frequency, ensuring prolonged one-body molecular lifetimes up to 10 seconds. We also show practical methods to measure the MW field strength and polarization using a simple homemade dipole probe, and to characterize phase-noise down to -170 dBc/Hz with a commercial spectrum analyser and a notch filter. Those capabilities allowed us to evaporatively cool our molecular sample to deep quantum degeneracy. Furthermore, the polarization tunability enabled the observation of field-linked resonances and facilitated the creation of field-linked tetramers.These techniques advance the study of ultracold polar molecules and broaden the potential applications of MW tools in other platforms of quantum sciences.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of CZT Detector Performance in Alpha and Gamma Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presented is a work on the performance studies of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) planar detector structures. Current-voltage (IV), capacitance-voltage (CV), and gamma- and alpha-spectroscopy measurements were carried out to provide the essential baseline required for forthcoming defect configuration impact studies on the detector spectroscopy performance. For each tested sensor, spectroscopic responses were recorded with several bias voltages applied. The described suite of measurements provides the parameters needed to evaluate, bulk resistivity, signal efficiency, and energy resolution for characteristic peaks at different energies. Readout configurations and data processing are discussed in related sections.</description>
