      <title>Strict Self-Assembly of Discrete Self-Similar Fractal Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives a (polynomial time) algorithm to decide whether a given Discrete Self-Similar Fractal Shape can be assembled in the aTAM model.In the positive case, the construction relies on a Self-Assembling System in the aTAM which strictly assembles a particular self-similar fractal shape, namely a variant $K^\infty$ of the Sierpinski Carpet. We prove that the aTAM we propose is correct through a novel device, \emph{self-describing circuits} which are generally useful for rigorous yet readable proofs of the behaviour of aTAMs.We then discuss which self-similar fractals can or cannot be strictly self-assembled in the aTAM. It turns out that the ability of iterates of the generator to pass information is crucial: either this \emph{bandwidth} is eventually sufficient in both cardinal directions and $K^\infty$ appears within the fractal pattern after some finite number of iterations, or that bandwidth remains ever insufficient in one direction and any aTAM trying to self-assemble the shape will end up either bounded with an ultimately periodic pattern covering arbitrarily large squares. This is established thanks to a new characterization of the productions of systems whose productions have a uniformly bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>On Maximal Families of Binary Polynomials with Pairwise Linear Common Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the construction of maximal families of polynomials over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, all having the same degree $n$ and a nonzero constant term, where the degree of the GCD of any two polynomials is $d$ with $1 \le d\le n$. The motivation for this problem lies in a recent construction for subspace codes based on cellular automata. More precisely, the minimum distance of such subspace codes relates to the maximum degree $d$ of the pairwise GCD in this family of polynomials. Hence, characterizing the maximal families of such polynomials is equivalent to determining the maximum cardinality of the corresponding subspace codes for a given minimum distance. We first show a lower bound on the cardinality of such families, and then focus on the specific case where $d=1$. There, we characterize the maximal families of polynomials over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$. Our findings prompt several more open questions, which we plan to address in an extended version of this work.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Multilevel Quorum System for Probabilistic Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the notion of a multilevel, slashable quorum system, where an application can obtain gradual levels of assurance that a certain value is bound to be decided (or "finalized") in a global consensus procedure, unless a large number of Byzantine processes are exposed to slashing (that is, penalty on staked assets). Our construction is a highly parameterized generalization of quorum systems based on finite projective spaces, with asymptotic high availability and optimal slashing properties. In particular, we show that any quorum system whose ground elements are disjoint subsets of nodes (e.g. "commmittees" in committee-based consensus protocols) has asymptotic high availability under very reasonable conditions, a general proof with significance of its own. Under similarly relaxed conditions, we show that our construction has asymptotically optimal slashing properties with respect to message complexity and process load; this illustrates a fundamental trade off between message complexity, load, and slashing. Our multilevel construction allows nodes to decide how many "levels" of finalization assurance they wish to obtain, noting that this functionality, if applied to a proof-of-stake blockchain, can be seen either as (i) a form of an early, slashing-based, probabilistic block finalization; or (ii) a service for reorg tolerance.</description>

      <title>On the Paley RIP and Paley graph extractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing explicit RIP matrices is an open problem in compressed sensing theory. In particular, it is quite challenging to construct explicit RIP matrices that break the square-root bottleneck. On the other hand, providing explicit $2$-source extractors is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science, cryptography and combinatorics. Nowadays, there are only a few known constructions for explicit $2$-source extractors (with negligible errors) that break the half barrier for min-entropy.
  In this paper, we establish a new connection between RIP matrices breaking the square-root bottleneck and $2$-source extractors breaking the half barrier for min-entropy. Here we focus on an RIP matrix (called the Paley ETF) and a $2$-source extractor (called the Paley graph extractor), where both are defined from quadratic residues over the finite field of odd prime order $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. As a main result, we prove that if the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, then the Paley graph extractor breaks the half barrier for min-entropy as well. Since it is widely believed that the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, our result accordingly provides a new affirmative intuition on the conjecture for the Paley graph extractor by Benny Chor and Oded Goldreich.</description>

      <title>Two questions on Kneser colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate two questions on Kneser graphs $KG_{n,k}$. First, we prove that the union of $s$ non-trivial intersecting families in ${[n]\choose k}$ has size at most ${n\choose k}-{n-s\choose k}$ for all sufficiently large $n$ that satisfy $n&gt;(2+\epsilon)k^2$ with $\epsilon&gt;0$. We provide an example that shows that this result is essentially tight for the number of colors close to $\chi(KG_{n,k})=n-2k+2$. We also improve the result of Bulankina and Kupavskii on the choice chromatic number, showing that it is at least $\frac 1{16} n\log n$ for all $k&lt;\sqrt n$ and $n$ sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>A New Temporal Interpretation of Cluster Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NP-complete graph problem Cluster Editing seeks to transform a static graph into a disjoint union of cliques by making the fewest possible edits to the edges. We introduce a natural interpretation of this problem in temporal graphs, whose edge sets change over time. This problem is NP-complete even when restricted to temporal graphs whose underlying graph is a path, but we obtain two polynomial-time algorithms for restricted cases. In the static setting, it is well-known that a graph is a disjoint union of cliques if and only if it contains no induced copy of $P_3$; we demonstrate that no general characterisation involving sets of at most four vertices can exist in the temporal setting, but obtain a complete characterisation involving forbidden configurations on at most five vertices. This characterisation gives rise to an FPT algorithm parameterised simultaneously by the permitted number of modifications and the lifetime of the temporal graph.</description>

      <title>Expanded-clique graphs and the domination problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ such that each vertex $v_i$ has a value $f(v_i)$, the expanded-clique graph $H$ is the graph where each vertex $v_i$ of $G$ becomes a clique $V_i$ of size $f(v_i)$ and for each edge $v_iv_j \in E(G)$, there is a vertex of $V_i$ adjacent to an exclusive vertex of $V_j$. In this work, among the results, we present two characterizations of the expanded-clique graphs, one of them leads to a linear-time recognition algorithm. Regarding the domination number, we show that this problem is \NP-complete for planar bipartite $3$-expanded-clique graphs and for cubic line graphs of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Vertex-minor universal graphs for generating entangled quantum subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of $k$-stabilizer universal quantum state, that is, an $n$-qubit quantum state, such that it is possible to induce any stabilizer state on any $k$ qubits, by using only local operations and classical communications. These states generalize the notion of $k$-pairable states introduced by Bravyi et al., and can be studied from a combinatorial perspective using graph states and $k$-vertex-minor universal graphs. First, we demonstrate the existence of $k$-stabilizer universal graph states that are optimal in size with $n=\Theta(k^2)$ qubits. We also provide parameters for which a random graph state on $\Theta(k^2)$ qubits is $k$-stabilizer universal with high probability. Our second contribution consists of two explicit constructions of $k$-stabilizer universal graph states on $n = O(k^4)$ qubits. Both rely upon the incidence graph of the projective plane over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. This provides a major improvement over the previously known explicit construction of $k$-pairable graph states with $n = O(2^{3k})$, bringing forth a new and potentially powerful family of multipartite quantum resources.</description>
