      <description>arXiv:2407.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their recent work [Phys. Rev. B 109, 184409(2024)], Manchon and Pezo develop a linear (in magnetization) theory, in order to investigate high-order harmonic generation (HHG). Here, we show that such linear theory cannot describe HHG, which, by definition is a nonlinear process.</description>

      <title>Observation of Co-propagating Chiral Zero Modes in Magnetic Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological singularities, such as Weyl points and Dirac points, can give rise to unidirectional propagation channels known as chiral zero modes (CZMs) when subject to a magnetic field. These CZMs are responsible for intriguing phenomena like the chiral anomaly in quantum systems. The propagation direction of each CZM is determined by both the applied magnetic field and the topological charge of the singularity point. While counter-propagating CZMs have been observed in 2D and 3D systems, the realization of co-propagating CZMs has remained elusive. Here we present the first experimental observation of co-propagating CZMs in magnetic photonic crystals hosting a single pair of ideal Weyl points WPs. By manipulating the crystal's structural configuration, we spatially alter the locations of the WPs, creating pseudo-magnetic fields in opposite directions between them. This arrangement results in a pair of CZMs that possess the same group velocity and co-propagate. Our work opens up new possibilities for topological manipulation of wave propagation and may lead to advancements in optical waveguides, switches, and various other applications.</description>

      <title>Network model for magnetic higher-order topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a network-model realization of magnetic higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) in the presence of the combined space-time symmetry $C_4\mathcal{T}$ -- the product of a fourfold rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We show that the system possesses two types of HOTPs. The first type, analogous to Floquet topology, generates a total of $8$ corner modes at $0$ or $\pi$ eigenphase, while the second type, hidden behind a weak topological phase, yields a unique phase with $8$ corner modes at $\pm\pi/2$ eigenphase (after gapping out the counterpropagating edge states), arising from the product of particle-hole and phase rotation symmetry. By using a bulk $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index ($Q$), we found both HOTPs have $Q=2$, whereas $Q=0$ for the trivial and the conventional weak topological phase. Together with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index associated with the reflection matrix, we are able to fully distinguish all phases. Our work motivates further studies on magnetic topological phases and symmetry protected $2\pi/n$ boundary modes, as well as suggests that such phases may find their experimental realization in coupled-ring-resonator networks.</description>

      <title>Internal entropy from heat current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the effective internal entropy of quasiparticles within the non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall effect manifests in the heat current through a tunneling barrier. We derive the electric current and heat current resulting from voltage and heat biases of the junction, taking into account the quasiparticles' internal entropy. We find that when the tunneling processes are dominated by quasiparticle tunneling of one type of charge, the effective internal entropy can be inferred from the measurement of the heat current and the charge current. Our methods may be used to conclusively identify non-Abelian quasiparticles, such as the anyons that emerge in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical responses and quantum geometry in rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the nonlinear optical response of ABC trilayer graphene with inversion symmetry broken by the application of a displacement field perpendicular to the trilayer. We show that rhombohedral trilayer graphene exhibits a large bulk photovoltaic effect arising from a DC shift current response. The conductivity of the trilayer contains features similar to AB bilayer graphene as well as features distinct from AB bilayer graphene. The new features of ABC trilayer graphene relative to AB bilayer graphene arise from the quantum geometric features of the electronic band structure and can be tuned by varying the displacement field. We focus on a regime of displacement field where certain band gaps close and reopen away from the charge neutrality point leading to drastic changes in the quantum geometric structure in momentum space, a feature characteristic of the trilayer graphene band structure. These features manifest as a sign change in shift current conductivity in a certain frequency window and can thus serve as a probe of quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Diffraction Imaging of Electron Dynamics in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizing the electron dynamics in four dimensions of space and time is crucial to the understanding of several ubiquitous processes in nature. Hence, ultrafast X-ray and electron imaging tools have been developed to probe the dynamics of matter by means of the time-resolved diffraction imaging (TRDI). In this work, we report an extension of the theory underlying the TRDI to the case of the laser-driven electron dynamics in solid state systems. We demonstrate that the TRDI signal encodes an essential information about the time-dependent electron density of the system under study and thus makes it possible to decipher the ultrafast quantum dynamics and the electron transfer phenomena in solids. We apply the developed approach to image the laser-driven electron dynamics in neutral graphene showing that the predictions made by the fully quantum version of the TRDI deviate significantly from those obtained with the conventional semiclassical approach.</description>

      <title>Observation of exceptional line semimetal in three-dimensional non-Hermitian phononic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological phases, which exhibit unique features such as skin effect and exceptional points originated from nontrivial band topologies in complex plane, have attracted enormous attention in condensed-matter physics and metamaterials. Here we report the realization of an exceptional line semimetal in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian phononic crystal. A pair of exceptional rings with opposite topologies are connected by the drumhead bulk states in the first Brillouin zone. The exceptional rings not only possess wave-function topology and thus result in the drumhead surface states, but also host spectral topology and thereby give rise to the hybrid-order geometry-dependent skin effect in three dimensions. Our experimental results evidence the complete non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence of the three-dimensional exceptional line semimetal, and may pave the way for designing non-Hermitian acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Landau levels for massive disclinated graphene-based topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the massive Kane-Mele model for graphene in the presence of disclination and an external magnetic field, where graphene behaviors as a topological insulator. In the low-energy limit, the effective field equation for graphene is described by a Dirac equation with three different degrees of freedom. We succeed to decouple the set of eight components of the Dirac equation by using the spin projector \hat{C} in the disclinated geometry. As consequence, we obtain the Landau levels in this framework, in which we note the emergence of zero modes as edge states due to the inversion symmetry breaking. We also note that for different sites in sublattices \mathcal{A/B}, one can have different values of gap width.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Networks as Skyrmion Crystals in Chiral Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground states of a chiral magnet with a square anisotropy and show that it supports domain wall networks as stable ground states. A domain wall junction in the domain wall network turns out to be a skyrmion with half topological charge and, therefore, the found domain wall network has a second topological nature, a skyrmion crystal. More specifically, we present a ground-state phase diagram of the chiral magnet with varying anisotropy parameters consisting of skyrmion lattices, chiral soliton lattices, and ferromagnetic states. In the presence of the square anisotropy, the skyrmion crystal forms a domain wall network. The size of domains in the domain wall network is shown to be tunable by an external magnetic field, offering a way to realize experimentally detectable domain wall networks.</description>

      <title>Electronic Correlations in Multielectron Silicon Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize technology with capabilities to solve real-life problems that are computationally complex or even intractable for modern computers [1] by offering sufficient high quality qubits to perform complex error-corrected calculations. Silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor based quantum dots present a promising pathway for realizing practical quantum computers. To improve certain qubit properties, it is a common strategy to incorporate multiple electrons in the same dot in order to form qubits in higher confined orbital states. Theoretical modelling is an essential part of understanding the quantum behaviour of these electrons, providing a basis for validating the physical working of device models as well as providing insights into experimental data.
  Hartree-Fock theory is an imperative tool for the electronic structure modelling of multi-electron quantum dots due to its ability to simulate a large number of electrons with manageable computation load. However, an efficient calculation of the self-consistent field becomes hard because dot formations in silicon are characterized by strong electron-electron interactions and conduction band valleys, besides the relatively high comparative effective mass, which add to create a behaviour dominated by repulsion between electrons rather than a well established shell structure. In this paper, we present a Hartree-Fock-based method that accounts for these complexities for the modelling of silicon quantum dots. With this method, we first establish the significance of including electron-electron interactions and valley degree of freedom and their implications. We then explore a simple case of anisotropic dots and observe the impact of anisotropy on dot formations.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Bias Dependence of Visible Height of Monatomic Pb(111) Steps: Consequence of Quantum-Size Effect for Thin Metallic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local structural and electronic properties of thin Pb(111) films grown on Si(111)7x7 surface are experimentally studied by means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). It is shown that the visible height $h$ of the monatomic step on Pb(111) surface demonstrates oscillatory dependence on bias voltage $U$. The period of these oscillations coincides with the period of the oscillations of both local tunneling conductance ($dI/dU$) and the rate of the STM tip displacement ($dZ/dU$) at sweeping $U$. It points to the fact that the observed oscillations of the visible height of monatomic Pb(111) step are controlled by coherent resonant tunneling of electrons from the STM tip to Pb(111) film through quantum-well states in thin Pb(111) film. We argue that the maximum and minimum visible heights of the monatomic Pb(111) step correspond to the bias voltages, at which local densities of states for the Pb(111) terraces of different thicknesses are equal.</description>

      <title>Exploring wetting dynamics of water nanodroplet on nano-textured surfaces: atomistic insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static and dynamic wetting behaviors of a water nanodroplet are investigated on flat and structured titanium (Ti) surfaces by using a fully atomistic simulation. Firstly, the results obtained for a water nanodroplet on a flat Ti surface agree with the static contact angle reported in the literature. Furthermore, to unveil the mechanisms of the water nanodroplet behavior on nano-textured surfaces, we analyze the impact of the roughness factors, the structure period, and sizes compared to the nanodroplet diameter. The introduction of the surface roughness produces an inhomogeneous spreading of the nanodroplet. The degree of roughness and the specific dimensions of the surface grooves determine these wetting processes. Surfaces with larger grooves and spacing tend to support more extensive spreading, while those with narrower grooves and higher roughness limit spreading. The obtained results also demonstrate damping in droplet vibrations accompanied by a gradual decrease in the dynamic contact angle of water nanodroplets on both flat and rough Ti surfaces, indicating a transition to a hydrophobic state. This effect is caused by the atomic bonding of water atoms to the surface ones and is shown to strongly depend on the surface roughness factors. The simulation results provide atomiclevel insights into the wetting mechanisms on surfaces featuring nanometric and sub-micrometric roughness, typically induced by femtosecond laser processing.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac-Pauli physics in lead-halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard quantum electrodynamics (QED), the so-called non-minimal (Pauli) coupling is suppressed for elementary particles and has no physical implications. Here, we show that the Pauli term naturally appears in a known family of Dirac materials -- the lead-halide perovskites, suggesting a novel playground for the study of analogue QED effects. We outline measurable manifestations of the Pauli term in the phenomena pertaining to (i) the Klein paradox and (ii) relativistic corrections to bound states. In particular, we demonstrate that the binding energy of an electron in the vicinity of a positively charged defect is noticeably decreased due to the polarizability of lead ions and the appearance of a Darwin-like term. Our study adds to understanding of quantum phenomena in lead-halide perovskites, and paves the way for tabletop simulations of analogue Dirac-Pauli equations.</description>

      <title>On the characteristics of helium filled nano-pores in amorphous silicon thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of helium-filled nanopores in amorphous silicon are elucidated by combining theoretical knowledge of helium electronic structure with the results of Scanning Transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM/EELS). Two of the properties determined are the density and pressure of the confined helium, these being key properties which are needed for application. The experimental data consists, firstly of the shift of the helium 1s^2-&gt; 1s2p(^1P) excitation energy from that of a free atom upon entering a condensed phase, and secondly, the intensities of both the elastically and inelastically scattered electron beams. Analysis uniting theory with the STEM/EELS measurements for both the helium-filled pores and earlier similar studies of helium encapsulated as bubbles in solid silicon is combined with fully trustworthy and closely related data for helium in its bulk condensed phases. The non-empirical theory used, containing no free parameters, is validated by the excellent agreement between the energy shifts predicted for bulk condensed helium with the entirely independently measured values. The above comparisons between the pores and bubbles with the bulk material show that the helium behaviour is essentially the same in all three of these environments. This means that, although the pressure is clearly temperature dependent, the other important properties are governed solely by the helium density. Although the energy of the electron beam used for the pore measurements differs from that in the bubble experiments, it is shown that scaling the results of either the pore or bubbles results using standard scattering theory almost exactly reproduces the experimental results for the other system. This provides confirmatory evidence that the behaviour of the helium in the pores is essentially the same as that in the bubbles.</description>

      <title>Layer-Dependent Charge State Lifetime of Single Se Vacancies in WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect engineering in two-dimensional semiconductors has been exploited to tune the optoelectronic properties and introduce new quantum states in the band gap. Chalcogen vacancies in transition metal dichalcogenides in particular have been found to strongly impact charge carrier concentration and mobility in 2D transistors as well as feature sub-gap emission and single-photon response. In this letter, we investigate the layer-dependent charge state lifetime of Se vacancies in WSe$_2$. In one monolayer WSe$_2$, we observe ultrafast charge transfer from the lowest unoccupied orbital of the top Se vacancy to the graphene substrate within (1.0 $\pm$ 0.2) ps measured via the current saturation in scanning tunneling approach curves. For Se vacancies decoupled by TMD multilayers, we find a sub-exponential increase of the charge lifetime from (62 $\pm$ 14) ps in bilayer to few nanoseconds in four-layer WSe$_2$, alongside a reduction of the defect state binding energy. Additionally, we attribute the continuous suppression and energy shift of the dI/dV in-gap defect state resonances at very close tip--sample distances to a current saturation effect. Our results provide a key measure of the layer-dependent charge transfer rate of chalcogen vacancies in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Superballistic conduction in hydrodynamic antidot graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscous electron flow exhibits exotic signatures such as superballistic conduction. Bending the geometry of the device is a must to observe hydrodynamic effects. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction behaves non-monotonically with the magnetic field, which is related with the ballistic-hydrodynamic transition. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow, and the experiment provides valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects and temperature dependence of the free energy barrier and shear frequency in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little is known about the quantum effects of friction, and first-principles studies are virtually non-existent. In multilayer graphene, the order of the stacking of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers slide to change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer graphene by focusing on quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that layers have to overcome to slide with respect to each other. We evaluate the free energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent harmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations. We obtain a very large reduction of the barrier of more than 30%. Temperature effects are weaker, although high temperatures induce a significant reduction of the barrier as well. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Protocol for scaling up a sign-ordered Kitaev chain without magnetic flux control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a new and promising material platform for realizing Kitaev chains with Majorana zero modes. So far, experiments have implemented a two-site chain with limited protection. We propose a protocol for scaling up the Kitaev chain that is accessible to current experiments and optimizes the Majorana protection. To this end, we make use of the fact that the relative sign of normal and superconducting hoppings mediated by an Andreev bound state can be changed by electrostatic gates. In this way, our method only relies on the use of individual electrostatic gates on hybrid regions, quantum dots, and tunnel barriers, respectively, without the need for individual magnetic flux control, greatly simplifying the device design. Our work provides guidance for realizing a topologically protected Kitaev chain, which is the building block of error-resilient topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure and transport properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) at a twist angle of $\theta\approx 1.696\text{{\deg}}$. Using a combination of molecular dynamics and tight-binding calculations, we find two superlattice gaps in the energy spectrum of the bulk, which emerge close to the Fermi level from the atomic rearrangement of the carbon atoms leading to a corrugation of the graphene sheets. Nanoribbons made from 1.696{\deg}-TBLG show edge-localized states inside the superlattice gaps. Applying the Green's function method, we demonstrate that the edge states carry electronic current with conductance values close to the conductance quantum. The edge states can generate a non-local resistance, which is not due to one-way transport at the edges but due to the fact that these states are localized only at certain edges of the system, depending on how the nanoribbon has been cut from the bulk.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching suppression in metal/Nb:SrTiO$_3$ Schottky contacts prepared by room-temperature Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepening the understanding of interface-type Resistive Switching (RS) in metal/oxide heterojunctions is a key step for the development of high-performance memristors and Schottky rectifiers. In this study, we address the role of metallization technique by fabricating prototypical metal/Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (M/NSTO) Schottky contacts via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Ultrathin Pt and Au electrodes are deposited by PLD onto single-crystal (001)-terminated NSTO substrates and interfacial transport is characterized by conventional macroscale methods and nanoscale Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy. We show that PLD metallization gives Schottky contacts with highly reversible current-voltage characteristics under cyclic polarization. Room-temperature transport is governed by thermionic emission with Schottky barrier height $\phi_B$(Pt/NSTO)=0.71-0.75eV, $\phi_B$(Au/NSTO)=0.70-0.83eV and ideality factors as small as n(Pt/NSTO)=1.1 and n(Au/NSTO)=1.6. RS remains almost completely suppressed upon imposing broad variations of the Nb doping and of the external stimuli (polarization bias, working temperature, ambient air exposure). At the nanoscale, we find that both systems display high spatial homogeneity of $\phi_B$(&lt;50meV), which is only partially affected by the NSTO mixed termination (|$\phi_B$ (M/SrO) - $\phi_B$ (M/TiO$_2$)|&lt;35meV). Experimental evidences and theoretical arguments indicate that the PLD metallization mitigates interfacial layer effects responsible for RS. This occurs thanks either to a reduction of the interfacial layer thickness and to the creation of an effective barrier against the permeation of ambient gas species affecting charge trapping and redox reactions. This description allows to rationalize interfacial aging effects, observed upon several-months-exposure to ambient air, in terms of interfacial re-oxidation.</description>

      <title>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E&gt;E_0, while for E&lt;E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</description>

      <title>Cheshire qudits from fractional quantum spin Hall states in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayers exhibit transport signatures consistent with a fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) state. We describe a route to construct topological quantum memory elements, dubbed Cheshire qudits, formed from punching holes in such a FQSH state and using proximity-induced superconductivity to gap out the resulting helical edge states. Cheshire qudits encode quantum information in states that differ by a fractional topological "Cheshire" charge that is hidden from local detection within a condensate anyons. Control of inter-edge tunneling by gates enables both supercurrent-based readout of a Cheshire qudit, and capacitive measurement of the thermal entropy associated with its topological ground-space degeneracy. Additionally, we systematically classify different types of gapped boundaries, Cheshire qudits, and parafermionic twist defects for various Abelian and non-Abelian candidate FQSH orders that are consistent with the transport data, and describe experimental signatures to distinguish these orders.</description>

      <title>Geometry fluctuations in chiral superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of chiral superfluids and superconductors to the background geometry leads to surprising geometric induction phenomena. We show that this coupling bears important consequences even in a nearly flat background, through its signature in thermal fluctuations. Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free energy of a chiral superfluid minimally coupled to the background geometry, we show that the interaction strength between vortices gets renormalized by geometry fluctuations. In our setup, these arise from the shape fluctuations of the underlying two-dimensional substrate, and are controlled by its bending rigidity and tension. In the tensionless limit, the fluctuations lower the vortex interaction strength at large distances, which leads to a lowering of the BKT transition temperature. We study this effect in terms of the renormalization group flow of a dual sine-Gordon theory of the superfluid transition coupled to the substrate shape. It shows that, in turn, the chiral superfluid order can suppress the amplitude of shape fluctuations, resulting in an extended phase diagram which links the superfluid transition to the crumpling transition of the substrate. These reveal thermodynamic signatures of chirality in the superfluid transition.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Modes as a Source of Anomalous Charge Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steady-state currents generically occur both in systems with continuous translation invariance and in nonequilibrium settings with particle drift. In either case, thermal fluctuations advected by the current act as a source of noise for slower hydrodynamic modes. This noise is unconventional, since it is highly correlated along spacetime rays. We argue that, in quasi-one-dimensional geometries, the correlated noise from ballistic modes generically gives rise to anomalous full counting statistics (FCS) for diffusively spreading charges. We present numerical evidence for anomalous FCS in two settings: (1) a two-component continuum fluid, and (2) the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) initialized in a nonequilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Unifying Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise a Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout in circuit QED. By studying qubits coupled to cavity photons and driven at the resonance frequency of the cavity $\omega_{\rm r}$, we establish a universal connection between the qubit AC Stark shift and the longitudinal and dispersive coupling to photons. We find that the longitudinal coupling $g_\parallel$ is controlled by the slope of the AC Stark shift as function of the driving strength $A_{\rm q}$, while the dispersive shift $\chi$ depends on its curvature. The two quantities become proportional to each other in the weak drive limit ($A_{\rm q}\rightarrow 0$). Our approach unifies the adiabatic limit ($\omega_{\rm r}\rightarrow 0$) -- where $g_\parallel$ is generated by the static spectrum curvature (or quantum capacitance) -- with the diabatic one, where the static spectrum plays no role. We derive analytical results supported by exact numerical simulations. We apply them to superconducting and spin-hybrid cQED systems, showcasing the flexibility of faster-than-dispersive longitudinal readout.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Simulator of a Quantum Field Theory with Fermion-Spin Systems in Silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom, relevant for a range of quantum field theories, represents a promising application for quantum simulators. Mapping fermions to qubits is challenging in $2+1$ and higher spacetime dimensions, and mapping bosons demands substantial quantum-computational overhead. These features complicate the realization of mixed fermion-boson quantum systems in digital quantum computers. We propose a native fermion-(large-)spin analog quantum simulator by utilizing dopant arrays in silicon. Specifically, we show how to use a dynamical lattice of coupled nuclear spins and conduction-band electrons to realize a quantum field theory: an extended Jackiw-Rebbi model involving coupled fermions and quantum rotors. We demonstrate the feasibility of observing dynamical mass generation and a confinement-deconfinement quantum phase transition in 1+1 dimensions on this platform, even in the presence of strong long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, we employ finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov simulations to investigate the dynamics of mass generation in two-dimensional square and honeycomb arrays, showing that this phenomenon can be simulated with realistic experimental parameters. Our findings reveal two distinct phases, and demonstrate robustness against the addition of Coulomb interactions. Finally, we discuss experimental signatures of the phases through transport and local charge sensing in dopant arrays. This study lays the foundation for quantum simulations of quantum field theories exhibiting fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom using donors in silicon.</description>

      <title>The integer quantum Hall transition: an $S$-matrix approach to random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new $S$-matrix approach to numerical simulations of network models and apply it to random networks that we proposed in a previous work 10.1103/PhysRevB.95.125414. Random networks are modifications of the Chalker-Coddington (CC) model for the integer quantum Hall transition that more faithfully capture the physics of electrons moving in a strong magnetic field and a smooth disorder potential. The new method has considerable advantages compared to the transfer matrix approach, and gives the value $\nu \approx 2.4$ for the critical exponent of the localization length in a random network. This finding confirms our previous result and is surprisingly close to the experimental value $\nu_{\text{exp}} \approx 2.38$ observed at the integer quantum Hall transition but substantially different from the CC value $\nu_\text{CC} \approx 2.6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (EBD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.</description>

      <title>Quantized circular dichroism on the edge of quantum Hall systems: The many-body Chern number as seen from the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines the quantized value of the Hall conductivity. Interestingly, this topological property can also be accessed through a dissipative response, by subjecting the system to a circular drive and comparing excitation rates obtained for opposite orientations of the drive. This quantized circular dichroism assumes that only the bulk contributes to the response. Indeed, in a confined and isolated system, the edge contribution exactly cancels the bulk response. This work explores an important corollary of the latter observation: If properly isolated, the circular dichroic response stemming from the edge of a quantum Hall droplet must be quantized, thus providing an appealing way to probe the many-body Chern number. Importantly, we demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms. Edge dichroic responses emerge as a practical probe for strongly-correlated topological phases, accessible in cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Discovering Local Hidden-Variable Models for Arbitrary Multipartite Entangled States and Arbitrary Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement correlations in quantum systems can exhibit non-local behavior, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics with applications such as device-independent quantum information processing. However, the explicit construction of local hidden-variable (LHV) models remains an outstanding challenge in the general setting. To address this, we develop an approach that employs gradient-descent algorithms from machine learning to find LHV models which reproduce the statistics of arbitrary measurements for quantum many-body states. In contrast to previous approaches, our method employs a general ansatz, enabling it to discover an LHV model in all cases where the state is local. Therefore, it provides actual estimates for the critical noise levels at which two-qubit Werner states and three-qubit GHZ and W states become non-local. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that two-spin subsystems in the ground states of translationally invariant Hamiltonians are local, while bigger subsystems are in general not. Our method now offers a quantitative tool for determining the regimes of non-locality in any given physical context, including scenarios involving non-equilibrium and decoherence.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of complex energy braiding in a 1D non-Hermitian system with $n$th order long range asymmetrical coupling. Our work highlights the emergence of novel topological phenomena in such systems beyond the conventional nearest-neighbor interaction. The modified SSH model displays $n$ distinct knots and links combinations in the complex energy-momentum space under periodic boundary conditions (PBC), which can be controlled by varying the coupling strengths. A topological invariant, namely the braiding index, is introduced to characterize the different complex energy braiding profiles, which depends on the zeros and poles of the characteristic polynomials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian skin effect can be localized at one or both ends, signifying conventional or bipolar localization, depending on the sign of the braiding index. Phase transitions between different braiding phases with the same (opposite) sign of the topological invariant occur at Type-1 (Type-2) exceptional points, with Type-1 (Type-2) phase transitions accompanied by single (multiple) exceptional points. We propose an experimental set-up to realize the various braiding schemes based on the RLC circuit framework, which provides an accessible avenue for implementation without recourse to high-dimensional momentum space required in most other platforms.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets offer the unprecedented opportunity to study interactions between collective modes that in standard bulk ferromagnets do not cross paths. Indeed, they harbor an optical spin-wave branch, i.e. a spin wave which disperses weakly near the Brillouin zone center. When doped with free carriers, they also host the typical gapless plasmonic mode of 2D itinerant electron/hole systems. When the plasmon branch meets the optical spin-wave branch, energy and momentum matching occurs, paving the way for interactions between the charge and spin sector. In this Letter we present a microscopic theory of such plasmon-magnon interactions, which is based on a double random phase approximation. We comment on the possibility to unveil this physics in recently isolated 2D honeycomb magnets such as ${\rm Cr}_2{\rm Ge}_2{\rm Te}_6$.</description>

Abstract: Effective relativistic field theory models capable of realizing various gapless topological states are presented in this work. We study the topological phase transitions of the Weyl and nodal line semimetal states in effective field theories. When the one form field giving rise to the Weyl nodes lie perpendicular to the plane where the nodal ring lives, the nodal ring and Weyl nodes could coexist as the mirror symmetry responsible for the nodal ring is not broken. New phases including a three-node state and a triple degenerate state exist. The nodal ring is immediately destroyed when the one form field lies in the plane of the ring. However, we show that in an eight-component spinor model, Weyl nodes and nodal rings could still coexist even when the one form field is parallel to the plane, due to the expanded symmetry. Topological invariants are calculated which confirm the interesting nontrivial topology of the three-node state and the triple-degenerate node. This work presents potential topological phase transitions in multiphase topological systems, which may be experimentally detected.</description>

Abstract: Two-terminal conductance quantization in the context of quantum Hall (QH) physics is intimately related to current carried by a discrete number of edge modes. Upon pinching off of a QH bar, one may reach regimes in which some modes which are fully transmitted (while the others are fully reflected), giving rise to quantized conductance plateaus. Here we study an alternative protocol for quantized values of the conductance, which relies on inter-mode equilibration. Concretely this is the result of considering different inequalities between charge equilibration and thermal equilibration lengths on one hand and geometrical lengths on the other hand, and accounting for the possibility of edge reconstruction. Taking the 2/3 state as a prototypical example, we obtain a host of scenarios leading to conductance plateaus at $e^2/3h$ (observed previously), $e^2/2h$ (recently observed), and $5e^2/9h$ (our prediction). Our approach facilitates distinguishing among various scenarios based on dc current auto- and cross-correlation (shot noise).</description>

      <title>Fano resonances in tilted Weyl semimetals in an oscillating quantum well</title>

Abstract: Considering the low-energy model of tilted Weyl semimetal, we study the electronic transmission through a periodically driven quantum well, oriented in the transverse direction with respect to the tilt. We adopt the formalism of Floquet scattering theory and investigate the emergence of Fano resonances as an outcome of matching between the Floquet sidebands and quasi-bound states. The Fano resonance energy changes linearly with the tilt strength suggesting the fact that tilt-mediated part of quasi-bound states energies depends on the above factor. Given a value of momentum parallel (perpendicular) to the tilt, we find that the energy gap between two Fano resonances, appearing for two adjacent values of transverse (collinear) momentum with respect to the tilt direction, is insensitive (sensitive) to the change in the tilt strength. Such a coupled (decoupled) behavior of tilt strength and the collinear (transverse) momentum can be understood from the tilt-mediated and normal parts of the quasi-bound state energies inside the potential well. We vary the other tilt parameters and chirality of the Weyl points to conclusively verify the exact form of the tilt-mediated part of the quasi-bound state energy that is the same as the tilt term in the static dispersion. The tilt orientation can significantly alter the transport in terms of evolution of Fano resoance energy with tilt momentum. We analytically find the explicit form of the bound state energy that further supports all our numerical findings. Our work paves the way to probe the tilt-mediated part of quasi-bound state energy to understand the complex interplay between the tilt and Fano resonance.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian matrices are ubiquitous in the description of nature ranging from classical dissipative systems, including optical, electrical, and mechanical metamaterials, to scattering of waves and open quantum many-body systems. Seminal line-gap and point-gap classifications of non-Hermitian systems using K-theory have deepened the understanding of many physical phenomena. However, ample systems remain beyond this description; reference points and lines do not in general distinguish whether multiple non-Hermitian bands exhibit intriguing exceptional points, spectral braids and crossings. To address this we consider two different notions: non-Hermitian band gaps and separation gaps that crucially encompass a broad class of multi-band scenarios, enabling the description of generic band structures with symmetries. With these concepts, we provide a unified and comprehensive classification of both gapped and nodal systems in the presence of physically relevant parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) and pseudo-Hermitian symmetries using homotopy theory. This uncovers new stable topology stemming from both eigenvalues and wave functions, and remarkably also implies distinct fragile topological phases. In particular, we reveal different Abelian and non-Abelian phases in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, described by frame and braid topology. The corresponding invariants are robust to symmetry-preserving perturbations that do not induce (exceptional) degeneracy, and they also predict the deformation rules of nodal phases. We further demonstrate that spontaneous $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking is captured by Chern-Euler and Chern-Stiefel-Whitney descriptions, a fingerprint of unprecedented non-Hermitian topology previously overlooked. These results open the door for theoretical and experimental exploration of a rich variety of novel topological phenomena in a wide range of physical platforms.</description>

Abstract: Considering a non-Hermitian version of $p$-wave Kitaev chain in the presence of additional second nearest neighbour tunneling, we study dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) which accounts for the vanishing Loschmidt amplitude. The locus of the Fisher's zero traces a continuous path on the complex time plane for the Hermitian case while it becomes discontinuous for non-Hermitian cases. This further leads to the half-unit jumps in the winding number characterizing a dynamical topological aspect of DQPT for non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Uncovering the interplay between non-Hermiticity and long-range tunneling, we find these features to be universally present irrespective of the additional second nearest neighbour tunneling terms as long as non-Hermiticity is preserved.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments demonstrating the creation of atomically sharp interfaces between hexagonal sapphire and cubic SrTiO$_3$ with finite twist, we here develop and study a general electronic band theory for this novel class of moir\'e heterostructures. We take into account the three-dimensional nature of the two crystals, allow for arbitrary combinations of Bravais lattices, finite twist angles, and different locations in momentum space of the low-energy electronic bands of the constituent materials. We analyze the general condition for a well-defined crystalline limit in the interface electron system and classify the associated "crystalline reference points". We discuss this in detail for the example of the two-dimensional lattice planes being square and triangular lattices on the two sides of the interface; this reveals non-trivial reference points at finite twist angle and lattice mismatch, leading to a novel form of magic angles, which we refer to as "geometric magic angles". We further show that band structures of mixed dimensionality naturally emerge, where quasi-one- and two-dimensional pockets coexist. Explicit computations for different bulk Bloch Hamiltonians yield a collection of interesting features, such as isolated bands localized at interfaces of non-topological insulators, Dirac cones, van Hove singularities, a non-trivial evolution of the band structures with Zeeman-field, and topological interface bands. Our work illustrates the potential of these heterostructures and is anticipated to provide the foundation for moir\'e interface design and for the analysis of correlated physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Path integral approach to bosonisation and nonlinearities in exciton-polariton systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large exciton-polariton optical nonlinearities present a key mechanism for photonics-based communication, ultimately in the quantum regime. Enhanced nonlinear response from various materials hosting excitons and allowing for their strong coupling with light is therefore the topic of intense studies, both in theoretical and experimental domains. Reports on the scattering rates arising due to various system's nonlinearities, such as the exciton-exciton Coulomb interaction and the Pauli blocking that leads to the saturation of the exciton oscillator strength, however, are contradictory. In this work, we develop a formalism allowing to track the exciton nonlinearities appearing in the regime of strong coupling with photons, that includes finite temperatures, mixing of the exciton excited states, and the dark exciton contributions to saturation self-consistently. The equilibrium path integration approach employed here to address the polariton composite nature, leads to a transparent hierarchy of various contributions to nonlinearity. At the same time, by taking the simplest limit of zero temperature and so-called "rigid" excitons, through our framework we retrieve the expressions derived in conventional approaches for exciton interaction constants. In particular, our theory allows to clearly show that such interaction constants cannot be used as fitting parameters tunable in a wide range of values, as they are strictly defined by the material properties, and that other explanations are due for large optical nonlinearities recently reported.</description>

      <title>Fractional ac Josephson effect as evidence of topological hinge states in a Dirac semimetal NiTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate Josephson current between two 5~$\mu$m spaced superconducting indium leads, coupled to a NiTe$_2$ single crystal flake, which is a type-II Dirac semimetal. Under microwave irradiation, we demonstrate a.c. Josephson effect at millikelvin temperatures as a number of Shapiro steps. In addition to the integer ($n=1,2,3,4...$) steps, we observe fractional ones at half-integer values $n=1/2,3/2,5/2$ and 7/2, which corresponds to $\pi$ periodicity of current-phase relationship. In contrast to previous investigations, we do not observe $4\pi$ periodicity (disappearance of the odd $n=1,3,5...$ Shapiro steps), while the latter is usually considered as a fingerprint of helical surface states in Dirac semimetals and topological insulators. We argue, that our experiment confirms Josephson current through the topological hinge states in NiTe$_2$: since one can exclude bulk supercurrent in 5~$\mu$m long Josephson junctions, interference of the hinge modes is responsible for the $\pi$ periodicity, while stable odd Shapiro steps reflect chiral character of the topological hinge states.</description>

Abstract: We present a two-dimensional model of a Fermionic wire which shows a power-law conductance behavior despite the presence of uncorrelated disorder along the direction of the transport. The power-law behavior is attributed to the presence of energy eigenstates of diverging localization length below some energy cutoff, $E_c$. To study transport, we place the wire in contact with electron reservoirs biased around a Fermi level, $E$. We show that the conductance scales super-diffusively for $|E|&lt;E_c$ and decays exponentially for $|E|&gt;E_c$. At $|E|=E_c$, we show that the conductance scales diffusively or with different sub-diffusive power-laws depending on the sign of the expectation value of the disorder and the parameters of the wire.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental investigations of individual magnetic nanoparticles reveal a diverse range of magnetic relaxation times which cannot be explained by considering their size, shape, and surface anisotropy, suggesting other factors associated with the internal microstructure of the particles are at play. In this letter, we apply Langer's theory of thermal activation to single magnetic domain fcc Co nanoparticles, whose experimental microstructures are characterized by planar defects, and derive an analytic expression for the relaxation time. The obtained Arrhenius exponential and its prefactor, which is often assumed to be a constant, are here found to both depend exponentially on system size and the number of defects. Together they provide a quantitative prediction of the experimental findings, and more generally highlight the importance of structural defects when considering magnetic stability.</description>

Abstract: Spins of electrons in CMOS quantum dots combine exquisite quantum properties and scalable fabrication. In the age of quantum technology, however, the metrics that crowned Si/SiO2 as the microelectronics standard need to be reassessed with respect to their impact upon qubit performance. We chart the spin qubit variability due to the unavoidable atomic-scale roughness of the Si/SiO$_2$ interface, compiling experiments in 12 devices, and developing theoretical tools to analyse these results. Atomistic tight binding and path integral Monte Carlo methods are adapted for describing fluctuations in devices with millions of atoms by directly analysing their wavefunctions and electron paths instead of their energy spectra. We correlate the effect of roughness with the variability in qubit position, deformation, valley splitting, valley phase, spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling. These variabilities are found to be bounded and lie within the tolerances for scalable architectures for quantum computing as long as robust control methods are incorporated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charge transport in voltage-biased single-channel junctions involving helical superconductors with finite Cooper pair momentum. For a Josephson junction, the equilibrium current-phase relation shows a superconducting diode effect: the critical current depends on the propagation direction. We formulate a scattering theory for voltage-biased Josephson diodes and show that multiple Andreev reflection processes cause a rich subharmonic structure in the DC current-voltage curve at low temperatures and small voltages due to Doppler shifts of the spectral gap. In the current-biased case, the diode efficiency has maximal rectification efficiency $\eta_0\approx 0.4$ for this model. In the voltage-biased case, however, the rectification efficiency can reach the ideal value $\eta=1$. We also discuss charge transport for NS junctions between a normal metal and a helical superconductor and comment on related models with spin-orbit interactions and magnetic Zeeman fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present here a Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum for the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene obtained using an ab initio based multi-million atom tight-binding model. We incorporate a hexagonal boron nitride substrate and out-of-plane atomic relaxation. The effects of a magnetic field are introduced via the Peierls modification of the long-range tight-binding matrix elements and the Zeeman spin splitting effects. A nanoribbon geometry is studied, and the quantum size effects for the sample widths up to 1 $\mu$m are analyzed both for a large energy window and for the flatband around the Fermi level. For sufficiently wide ribbons, where the role of the finite geometry is minimized, we obtain and plot the Hofstadter spectrum and identify the in-gap Chern numbers by counting the total number of chiral edge states crossing these gaps. Subsequently, we examine the Wannier diagrams to identify the insulating states at charge neutrality. We establish the presence of three types of electronic states: moir\'e, mixed, and conventional. These states describe both the bulk Landau levels and the edge states crossing gaps in the spectrum. The evolution of the bulk moir\'e flatband wavefunctions in the magnetic field is investigated, predicting a decay of the electronic density from the moir\'e centers as the magnetic flux increases. Furthermore, the spatial properties of the three types of edge states are studied, illustrating the evolution of their localization as a function of the nanoribbon momentum.</description>

Abstract: This letter establishes a Floquet engineering framework in which coherent high frequency light with a time dependent amplitude can be used to parametrically excite and amplify THz plasmons, mirror plasmonic wave packets in time, generate momemtum-gapped plasmonic band structures, entangled plasmon pairs, and THz radiation in two dimensional Dirac systems. Our results show how low frequency plasmons can be coherently excited and manipulated without the need for THz light.</description>

      <title>Spatially Dependent in-Gap States Induced by Andreev Tunneling through a Single Electronic State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we observe in-gap states induced by Andreev tunneling through a single impurity state in a low carrier density superconductor (NaAlSi). The energy-symmetric in-gap states appear when the impurity state is located within the superconducting gap. In-gap states can cross the Fermi level, and they show X-shaped spatial variation. We interpret the in-gap states as a consequence of the Andreev tunneling through the impurity state, which involves the formation or breakup of a Cooper pair. Due to the low carrier density in NaAlSi, the in-gap state is tunable by controlling the STM tip-sample distance. Under strong external magnetic fields, the impurity state shows Zeeman splitting when it is located near the Fermi level. Our findings not only demonstrate the Andreev tunneling involving single electronic state, but also provide new insights for understanding the spatially-dependent in-gap states in low carrier density superconductors.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall States and First Landau Level Physics in Second Moir\'e Band of Twisted Bilayer MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the realistic continuum description of twisted bilayer MoTe2 and many-body exact diagonalization calculation, we establish that the second moir\'e band of twisted bilayer MoTe2, at a small twist angle of approximately 2{\deg}, serves as an optimal platform for achieving the long-sought non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall states without the need for external magnetic fields. Across a wide parameter range, our exact diagonalization calculations reveal that the half-filled second moir\'e band demonstrates the ground state degeneracy and spectral flows, which are consistent with the pfaffian state in the first Landau level. We further elucidate that the emergence of the non-Abelian state is deeply connected to the remarkable similarity between the second moir\'e band and the first Landau level. Essentially, the band not only exhibits characteristics akin to the first Landau level, $\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\mathrm{BZ}\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{k}\:\mathrm{tr}\:\eta(\mathbf{k}) \approx 3$ where $\eta_{ab}(\mathbf{k})$ is the Fubini-Study metric of the band, but also that its projected Coulomb interaction closely mirrors the Haldane pseudopotentials of the first Landau level. Motivated from this observation, we introduce a novel metric of "first Landau level"-ness of a band, which quantitatively measures the alignment of the projected Coulomb interaction with the Haldane pseudopotentials in Landau levels. This metric is then compared with the global phase diagram of the half-filled second moir\'e band, revealing its utility in predicting the parameter region of the non-Abelian state. In addition, we uncover that the first and third moir\'e bands closely resemble the lowest and second Landau levels, revealing a remarkable sequential equivalence between the moir\'e bands and Landau levels. We finally discuss the potential implications on experiments.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Mixed Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: \textit{strong symmetry}, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and \textit{weak symmetry}, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function $\mathrm{Tr}(O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho)$, the strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) is measured by the fidelity $F(\rho, O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho O_yO^{\dagger}_x)$, dubbed the \textit{fidelity correlator}. We prove that SW-SSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SW-SSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. { We also show that the symmetry breaking is "spontaneous
" in the sense that the effect of a local symmetry-breaking measurement cannot be recovered locally.} We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study non-thermal scenarios where decoherence induces SW-SSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SW-SSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SW-SSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SW-SSB, through correlation functions with higher R\'enyi indices.</description>

      <title>Constant search time algorithm via topological quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that quantum algorithms such as Grover's can provide a quadradic speed-up for unstructured search problems. By adding topological structure to a search problem, we show that it is possible to achieve a constant search-time quantum algorithm with a constant improvement of the search probability over classical search. Specifically, we study the spatial search algorithm implemented by a two-dimensional split-step quantum random walks that realize topologically nontrivial phases and show the asymptotic search behavior is constant with growing system size. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we determine the efficient search regions in the parameter space of the quantum walker. These regions correspond to pairs of trapped states formed near a lattice defect. By studying the spectral properties of the discrete time-evolution-operators, we show that these trapped states have large overlap with the initial state. This correspondence, which is analogous to localization by constructive interference of bound states, makes it possible to reach the best possible search-time asymptotic and produce a disorder-protected fast search in quantum random walks.</description>
