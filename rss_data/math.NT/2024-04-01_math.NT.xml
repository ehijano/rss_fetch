      <title>Weighted low-lying zeros of L-functions attached to Siegel modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weighted low-lying zeros of spinor and standard $L$-functions attached to degree 2 Siegel modular forms. We show the symmetry type of weighted low-lying zeros of spinor $L$-functions is symplectic, for test functions whose Fourier transform have support in $(-1,1)$, extending the previous range $(-\frac{4}{15},\frac{4}{15})$ by E. Kowalski, A. Saha and J. Tsimerman . We then show the symmetry type of weighted low-lying zeros of standard $L$-functions is also symplectic. We further extend the range of support by performing an average over weight. As an application, we discuss non-vanishing of central values of those $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>On smooth gaps between primes using the Maynard-Tao sieve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1999, Balog, Br\"udern, and Wooley (1999) showed there are infinitely many prime gaps $p-q$ that are $(\log p)^{\frac{3}{4}}$-smooth, and infinitely many consecutive prime gaps that are $(\log p)^\frac{7}{8}$-smooth. Advancements made since then by Zhang (2014), Maynard (2014), and Polymath8b (2014) towards resolving the twin prime conjecture have given us the tools to lower the bounds made by Balog, Br\"udern, and Wooley to 47. Moreover, we can show there are infinitely many $m$-tuples of primes whose gaps are all $y_m$-smooth for a calculable prime $y_m$.</description>

      <title>Modularity of higher theta series II: Chow group of the generic fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher theta series on moduli spaces of Hermitian shtukas were constructed by Feng--Yun--Zhang and conjectured to be modular, parallel to classical conjectures in the Kudla program. In this paper we prove the modularity of higher theta series after restriction to the generic locus. The proof is an upgrade, using motivic homotopy theory, of earlier work of Feng--Yun--Zhang which established generic modularity of $\ell$-adic realizations. In the process, we develop some general tools of broader utility. One such is the "motivic sheaf-cycle correspondence", a categorical trace formalism for extracting computations in the Chow group from computations in Voevodsky's derived category of motives. Another new tool is the "derived homogeneous Fourier transform", which we use to implement a form of Fourier analysis for motives.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport about the existence of ''canonical'' integral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type with quasi-parahoric level structure at a prime $p$. For these integral models, we moreover show uniformization of isogeny classes by integral local Shimura varieties, and prove a conjecture of Kisin and Pappas on local model diagrams.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for the Large Deviations of Selberg's Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\delta&gt;0$ and $\sigma=\frac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\delta}{\log T}$. We prove that, for any $\alpha&gt;0$ and $V\sim \alpha\log \log T$ as $T\to\infty$, $\frac{1}{T}\text{meas}\big\{t\in [T,2T]: \log|\zeta(\sigma+\rm{i} \tau)|&gt;V\big\}\geq C_\alpha(\delta)\int_V^\infty \frac{e^{-y^2/\log\log T}}{\sqrt{\pi\log\log T}} \rm{d} y,$ where $\delta$ is large enough depending on $\alpha$. The result is unconditional on the Riemann hypothesis. As a consequence, we recover the sharp lower bound for the moments on the critical line proved by Heap &amp; Soundararajan and Radziwi{\l}{\l} &amp; Soundararajan. The constant $C_\alpha(\delta)$ is explicit and is compared to the one conjectured by Keating &amp; Snaith for the moments.</description>

      <title>Number of solutions to a special type of unit equations in two unknowns, III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conjectured that for any fixed relatively prime positive integers $a,b$ and $c$ all greater than 1 there is at most one solution to the equation $a^x+b^y=c^z$ in positive integers $x,y$ and $z$, except for specific cases. We develop the methods in our previous work which rely on a variety from Baker's theory and thoroughly study the conjecture for cases where $c$ is small relative to $a$ or $b$. Using restrictions derived under which there is more than one solution to the equation, we obtain a number of finiteness results on the conjecture, which in particular enables us to find some new values of $c$ being presumably infinitely many such that for each such $c$ the conjecture holds true except for only finitely many pairs of $a$ and $b$. Most importantly we prove that if $c=13$ then the equation has at most one solution, except for $(a,b)=(3,10)$ or $(10,3)$ which exactly gives two solutions. Further our study with the help of Schmidt Subspace Theorem among others brings strong contributions to the study of Pillai's type Diophantine equations, which includes a general and satisfactory result on a well-known conjecture of M. Bennett on the equation $a^x-b^y=c$ for any fixed positive integers $a,b$ and $c$ with both $a$ and $b$ greater than 1. Some conditional results are presented under the $abc$-conjecture as well.</description>

      <title>A binary version of the Mahler-Popken complexity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (Mahler-Popken) complexity $\| n \|$ of a natural number $n$ is the smallest number of ones that can be used via combinations of multiplication and addition to express $n$, with parentheses arranged in such a way so as to form legal nestings. We generalize $\| \cdot \|$ by defining $\| n \|_{m}$ as the smallest number of possibly repeated selections from $\{ 1, 2, \ldots, m \}$ (counting repetitions), for fixed $m \in \mathbb{N}$, that can be used to express $n$ with the same operational and bracket symbols as before. There is a close relationship, as we explore, between $\|\cdot\|_{2}$ and lengths of shortest addition chains for a given natural number. This illustrates how remarkable it is that $(\| n \|_{2} : n \in \mathbb{N} )$ is not currently included in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences and has, apparently, not been studied previously. This, in turn, motivates our exploration of the complexity function $\| \cdot\|_{2}$, in which we prove explicit upper and lower bounds for $\|\cdot\|_{2}$ and describe some problems and further areas of research concerning $\|\cdot\|_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Lattices in rigid analytic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a profinite group $G$ and a rigid analytic space $X$, we study when an $\mathcal O_X(X)$-linear representation $V$ of $G$ admits a lattice, i.e. an $\mathcal O_{\mathcal X}(\mathcal X)$-linear model for a formal model $\mathcal X$ of $X$ in the sense of Berthelot. We give a positive answer, under mild assumptions, when $X$ is a "wide open" space. Via such a result, we are able to describe explicit subdomains of $X$ over which $V$ is constant after reduction modulo a power of $p$. As an application, we prove some explicit results on the reduction of sheaves of crystalline and semistable representations modulo powers of $p$. We also give an application to the pseudorepresentation carried by the Coleman--Mazur eigencurve.</description>

      <title>Clusters, toric ranks, and 2-ranks of hyperelliptic curves in the wild case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Galois cover $Y \to X$ of smooth projective geometrically connected curves over a complete discrete valuation field $K$ with algebraically closed residue field, we define a semistable model of $Y$ over the ring of integers of a finite extension of $K$ which we call the \emph{relatively stable model} $\mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{rst}}$ of $Y$, and we discuss its properties, eventually focusing on the case when $Y : y^2 = f(x)$ is a hyperelliptic curve viewed as a degree-$2$ cover of the projective line $X := \mathbb{P}_K^1$. Over residue characteristic different from $2$, it follows from known results that the toric rank (i.e.\ the number of loops in the graph of components) of the special fiber of $\mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{rst}}$ can be computed directly from the knowledge of the even-cardinality clusters of roots of the defining polynomial $f$. We instead consider the "wild" case of residue characteristic $2$ and demonstrate an analog to this result, showing that each even-cardinality cluster of roots of $f$ gives rise to a loop in the graph of components of the special fiber of $\mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{rst}}$ if and only if the depth of the cluster exceeds some threshold, and we provide a computational description of and bounds for that threshold. As a bonus, our framework also allows us to provide a formula for the $2$-rank of the special fiber of $\mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{rst}}$.</description>

      <title>Billiards in polyhedra: a method to convert 2-dimensional uniformity to 3-dimensional uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The class of 2-dimensional non-integrable flat dynamical systems has a rather extensive literature with many deep results, but the methods developed for this type of problems, both the traditional approach via Teichm\"{u}ller geometry and our recent shortline-ancestor method, appear to be exclusively plane-specific. Thus we know very little of any real significance concerning 3-dimensional systems.
  Our purpose here is to describe some very limited extensions of uniformity in 2 dimensions to uniformity in 3 dimensions. We consider a 3-manifold which is the cartesian product of the regular octagonal surface with the unit torus. This is a restricted system, in the sense that one of the directions is integrable. However, this restriction also allows us to make use of a transference theorem for arithmetic progressions established earlier by Beck, Donders and Yang.</description>

      <title>Uniformity of geodesic flow in non-integrable 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost nothing is known concerning the extension of $3$-dimensional Kronecker--Weyl equidistribution theorem on geodesic flow from the unit torus $[0,1)^3$ to non-integrable finite polycube translation $3$-manifolds.
  In the special case when a finite polycube translation $3$-manifold is the cartesian product of a finite polysquare translation surface with the unit torus $[0,1)$, we have developed a splitting method with which we can make some progress. This is a somewhat restricted system, in the sense that one of the directions is integrable.
  We then combine this with a split-covering argument to extend our results to some other finite polycube translation $3$-manifolds which satisfy a rather special condition and where none of the $3$ directions is integrable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our investigation focuses on an additive analogue of the Bloch-Gabber-Kato theorem which establishes a relation between the Milnor $K$-group of a field of positive characteristic and a Galois cohomology group of the field. Extending the Aritin-Schreier-Witt theory, we present an isomorphism from the Mackey product associated with the Witt group and the multiplicative groups to a Galois cohomology group. As a result, we give an expression for the torsion subgroup of the Brauer group of a field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ivan Niven's succinct proof that pi is irrational is easy to verify, but it begins with a magical formula that appears to come out of nowhere, and whose origin remains mysterious even after one goes through the proof. The goal of this expository paper is to describe a thought process by which a mathematician might come up with the proof from scratch, without having to be a genius. Compared to previous expositions of Niven's proof, perhaps the main novelty in the present account is an explicit appeal to the theory of orthogonal polynomials, which leads naturally to the consideration of certain integrals whose relevance is otherwise not immediately obvious.</description>

Abstract: Fix a finite set of primes $\mathcal{S}$, for an abelian variety $A_0$ over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ (with extra structures) which has supersingular good reductions at all $\ell\in\mathcal{S}$, we consider the simultaneous reduction modulo $\ell\in\mathcal{S}$ of several copies of $p$-adic/prime-to-$N$ Hecke orbits of $A_0$. We show that this simultaneous reduction map is always surjective under certain rationality condition on the copies of the Hecke orbits.</description>

      <title>Each friend of 10 has at least 10 nonidentical prime factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each positive integer n, if the sum of the factors of n is divided by n, then the result is called the abundancy index of n. If the abundancy index of some positive integer m equals the abundancy index of n but m is not equal to n, then m and n are called friends. A positive integer with no friends is called solitary. The smallest positive integer that is not known to have a friend and is not known to be solitary is 10.
  It is not known if the number 6 has odd friends, that is, if odd perfect numbers exist. In a 2007 article, Nielsen proved that the number of nonidentical prime factors in any odd perfect number is at least 9. A 2015 article by Nielsen, which was more complicated and used a computer program that took months to complete, increased the lower bound from 9 to 10.
  This work applies methods from Nielsen's 2007 article to show that each friend of 10 has at least 10 nonidentical prime factors.
  This is a formal write-up of results presented at the Southern Africa Mathematical Sciences Association Conference 2023 at the University of Pretoria.</description>

The original version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture asserts that $\prod \limits _{p \leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \sim C (\log x) ^{\text{rank}(E(\mathbb Q))}$ as $x \to \infty$. Goldfeld showed that this conjecture implies both the Riemann Hypothesis for $L(E, s)$ and the modern formulation of the conjecture i.e. that $\text{ord}_{s=1} L(E, s)= \text{rank}(E(\mathbb Q))$. In this paper, we prove that if we let $r=\text{ord} _{s=1}L(E, s)$, then under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis for $L(E, s)$, we have that $\prod \limits _{p \leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \sim C (\log x)^r$ for all $x$ outside a set of finite logarithmic measure. As corollaries, we recover not only Goldfeld's result, but we also prove a result in the direction of the converse. Our method of proof is based on establishing the asymptotic behaviour of partial Euler products of $L(E, s)$ in the right-half of the critical strip.</description>

Abstract: In 2013, Pollack et al. gave an asymptotic expression for the largest $k$ in terms of $x$ for which the string of inequalities $\varphi(n+1)\geq\varphi(n+2)\geq\cdots\geq\varphi(n+k)$ holds for some $n\leq x$, where $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. Their method of proof also works to derive an upper bound for $k$ with $\varphi$ replaced by $\sigma$, the sum-of-divisors function. In 2023, the first author and Vandehey gave an alternative proof for a weaker lower bound on $k$ in the string of equalities $\varphi(n+1)=\varphi(n+2)=\ldots=\varphi(n+k)$. Here we improve their bound with a similar method of proof.</description>

Abstract: Let $f(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}[x, y]$ be a cubic form with non-zero discriminant, and for each integer $m \in \mathbb{Z}$, let, $N_{f}(m)=\#\left\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}: f(x, y)=m\right\} $. In 1983, Silverman proved that $N_{f}(m)&gt;\Omega\left((\log |m|)^{3 / 5}\right)$ when $f(x, y)=x^{3}+y^{3}$. In this paper, we obtain an explicit bound for $N_f(m)$, namely, showing that $N_{f}(m)&gt;4.2\times 10^{-6}(\log |m|)^{11/13}$ (holds for infinitely many integers m), when $f(x, y)=x^{3}+y^{3}$.</description>
