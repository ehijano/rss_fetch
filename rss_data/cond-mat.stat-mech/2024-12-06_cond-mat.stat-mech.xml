      <title>Thermodynamic Fidelity of Generative Models for Ising System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has become a central technique for modeling in science and engineering, either complementing or as surrogates to physics-based models. Significant efforts have recently been devoted to models capable of predicting field quantities but the limitations of current state-of-the-art models in describing complex physics are not well understood. We characterize the ability of generative diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to describe the Ising model. We find diffusion models trained using equilibrium configurations obtained using Metropolis Monte Carlo for a range of temperatures around the critical temperature can capture average thermodynamic variables across the phase transformation and extrapolate to higher and lower temperatures. The model also captures the overall trends of physical properties associated with fluctuations (specific heat and susceptibility) except at the non-ergodic low temperatures and non-trivial scale-free correlations at the critical temperature, albeit with some difference in the critical exponent compared to Monte Carlo simulations. GANs perform more poorly on thermodynamic properties and are susceptible to mode-collapse without careful training. This investigation highlights the potential and limitations of generative models in capturing the complex phenomena associated with certain physical systems.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic arrow of time from multiscale perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal ($T$) symmetry, but the $T$ symmetry is strongly broken in the macroscopic world. In this Perspective, I review $T$ symmetry breaking frameworks: \textit{second law of thermodynamics, multiscale energy transfer}, and \textit{open systems}. In driven dissipative nonequilibrium systems, including turbulence, the multiscale energy flux from large scales to small scales helps determine the arrow of time. In addition, open systems are often irreversible due to particle and energy exchanges between the system and the environment. Causality is another important factor that breaks the $T$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Entropy estimation for partially accessible Markov networks based on imperfect observations: Role of finite resolution and finite statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating entropy production from real observation data can be difficult due to finite resolution in both space and time and finite measurement statistics. We characterize the statistical error introduced by finite sample size and compare the performance of three different entropy estimators under these limitations for two different paradigmatic systems, a four-state Markov network and an augmented Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme. We consider the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, a waiting-time based estimator for resolved transitions and a waiting-time based estimator for blurred transitions in imperfect observation scenarios. For perfect measurement statistics and finite temporal resolution, the estimator based on resolved transitions performs best in all considered scenarios. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation gives a better estimate than the estimator based on blurred transitions at low driving affinities, whereas the latter performs better at high driving affinities. Furthermore, we find that a higher temporal and spatial resolution leads to slower convergence of measurement statistics, implying that for short measurement times, a lower resolution may be beneficial. Additionally, we identify a self-averaging effect for the waiting-time based entropy estimators that can reduce their variance for observations with finite statistics.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of entanglement from crosscap states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear growth of entanglement after a quench from a state with short-range correlations is a universal feature of many body dynamics. It has been shown to occur in integrable and chaotic systems undergoing either Hamiltonian, Floquet or circuit dynamics and has also been observed in experiments. The entanglement dynamics emerging from long-range correlated states is far less studied, although no less viable using modern quantum simulation experiments. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy and mutual information from initial states which have long-range entanglement with correlation between antipodal points of a finite and periodic system. Starting from these crosscap states, we study both brickwork quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics and find distinct patterns of behaviour depending on the type of dynamics and whether the system is integrable or chaotic. Specifically, we study both dual unitary and random unitary quantum circuits as well as free and interacting fermion Hamiltonians. For integrable systems, we find that after a time delay the entanglement experiences a linear in time decrease followed by a series of revivals, while, in contrast, chaotic systems exhibit constant entanglement entropy. On the other hand, both types of systems experience an immediate linear decrease of the mutual information in time. In chaotic systems this then vanishes, whereas integrable systems instead experience a series of revivals. We show how the quasiparticle and membrane pictures of entanglement dynamics can be modified to describe this behaviour, and derive explicitly the quasiparticle picture in the case of free fermion models which we then extend to all integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion caused by two noises-active and thermal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of colloids inside an active system-e.g. within a living cell or the dynamics of active particles itself (e.g. self-propelled particles) can be modeled through overdamped Langevin equation which contains an additional noise term apart from the usual white Gaussian noise, originating from the thermal environment. The second noise is referred to as 'active noise' as it arises from activity such as chemical reactions. The probability distribution function (PDF or the propagator) in space-time along with moments provides essential information for understanding their dynamical behavior. Here we employ the phase-space path integral method to obtain the propagator, thereby moments and PDF for some possible models for such noise. At first, we discuss the diffusion of a free particle driven by active noise. We consider four different possible models for active noise, to capture the possible traits of such systems. We show that the PDF for systems driven by noises other than Gaussian noise largely deviates from normal distribution at short to intermediate time scales as a manifestation of out-of-equilibrium state, albeit converges to Gaussian distribution after a long time as a consequence of the central limit theorem. We extend our work to the case of a particle trapped in a harmonic potential and show that the system attains steady state at long time limit. Also, at short time scales, the nature of distribution is different for different noises, e.g. for particle driven by dichotomous noise, the probability is mostly concentrated near the boundaries whereas a long exponential tail is observed for a particle driven by Poissonian white noise.</description>

      <title>Pb transport on Si(111)-(7x7) following tip induced imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pb on Si(111)-(7x7) shows surprising nucleation and mass transport dynamics at odds with standard theories. To create local imbalances on stable Pb islands we use the tip of a scanning force microscope. We enforce a short, local contact between the island and our tip. The subsequent island height growth and the local contact potential difference are studied via scanning force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Though the island has a large volume increase after the contact, we observe that its surrounding wetting layer shows the same Pb density decrease as the global wetting layer. This indicates a collective density thinning of the wetting layer.</description>

      <title>A solvable model for strongly interacting nonequilibrium excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with all-to-all hopping and subject to incoherent pumping and decay, as is naturally probed in several recent experiments on excitons in WS2/WSe2 moir\'e systems, as well as quantum simulators. By positing a particular form of coupling to the environment, we derive the Lindblad jump operators and show that, in certain limits, the system admits a closed-form expression for the steady-state density matrix. Away from the exactly solvable regions, the steady-state can be obtained numerically for 100s-1000s of sites. We study the nonequilibrium phase diagram and phase transitions, which qualitatively matches the equilibrium phase diagram, agreeing with the intuition that increasing the intensity of the light is equivalent to changing the bosonic chemical potential. However, the steady-states are far from thermal states and the nature of the phase transitions is changed.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform Parafermion Chains: Low-Energy Physics and Finite-Size Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric Kitaev chain, comprising alternating topological and normal regions, hosts localized states known as edge-zero modes (EZMs) at its interfaces. These EZMs can pair to form qubits that are resilient to quantum decoherence, a feature expected to extend to higher symmetric chains, i.e., parafermion chains. However, finite-size effects may impact this ideal picture. Diagnosing these effects requires first a thorough understanding of the low-energy physics where EZMs may emerge. Previous studies have largely focused on uniform chains, with nonuniform cases inferred from these results. While recent work [Narozhny, Sci. Rep. 7, 1447 (2017)] provides an insightful analytical solution for a nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ chain with two topological regions separated by a normal one, its complexity limits its applicability to chains with more regions or higher symmetries. Here, we present a new approach based on decimating the highest-energy terms, facilitating the scalable analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ chains with any number of regions. We provide analytical results for both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and$\mathbb{Z}_3$ chains, supported by numerical findings, and identify the critical lengths necessary to preserve well-separated EZMs.</description>

      <title>Hubbard Model on the Honeycomb Lattice with an Indefinite Long-Range Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several studies have emphasized the impact of long-range Coulomb interactions in lattice fermions, yet conventional Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods face limitations due to their reliance on positive definite interaction matrices. We address this by decomposing the interaction matrix into positive- and negative-definite components, allowing for QMC calculations with manageable sign properties. This technique enables effective simulations on large lattices. Applying it to a honeycomb lattice with an indefinite interaction matrix, we identify a semi-metal to charge density wave phase transition within the Gross-Neveu criticality class. Notably, the phase transition boundary aligns with regions where the average sign sharply decreases, providing new evidence to the increasingly compelling research on the relationship between phase transitions and the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Linear fluctuation of interfaces in Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we find a scaling limit of the space-time mass fluctuation field of Glauber + Kawasaki particle dynamics around its hydrodynamic mean curvature interface limit. Here, the Glauber rates are scaled by $K=K_N$, the Kawasaki rates by $N^2$ and space by $1/N$. We start the process so that the interface $\Gamma_t$ formed is stationary that is, $\Gamma_t$ is `flat'. When the Glauber rates are balanced on $T^d$, $\Gamma_t=\Gamma=\{x: x_1=0\}$ is immobile and the hydrodynamic limit is given by $\rho(t,v) = \rho_+$ for $v_1\in (0,1/2)$ and $\rho(t,v)= \rho_-$ for $v_1\in (-1/2,0)$ for all $t\ge 0$, where $v=(v_1,\ldots,v_d)\in T^d$ identified with $[-1/2,1/2)^d$. Since in the formation the boundary region about the interface has width $O(1/\sqrt{K_N})$, we will scale the $v_1$ coordinate in the fluctuation field by $\sqrt{K_N}$ so that the scaling limit will capture information `near' the interface.
  We identify the fluctuation limit as a Gaussian field when $K_N\uparrow \infty$ and $K_N= O(\sqrt{\log(N)})$ in $d\leq 2$. In the one dimensional case, the field limit is given by ${\bf e}(v_1) B_t$ where $B_t$ is a Brownian motion and ${\bf e}$ is the normalized derivative of a decreasing `standing wave' solution $\phi$ of $\partial^2_{v_1} \phi - V'(\phi)=0$ on $R$, where $V'$ is the homogenization of the Glauber rates. In two dimensions, the limit is ${\bf e}(v_1)Z_t(v_2)$ where $Z_t$ is the solution of a one dimensional stochastic heat equation. The appearance of the function ${\bf e}(\cdot)$ in the limit field indicates that the interface fluctuation retains the shape of the transition layer $\phi$.</description>

      <title>Numerical Estimation of Limiting Large-Deviation Rate Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For statistics of rare events in systems obeying a large-deviation principle, the rate function is a key quantity. When numerically estimating the rate function one is always restricted to finite system sizes. Thus, if the interest is in the limiting rate function for infinite system sizes, first, several system sizes have to be studied numerically. Here, rare-event algorithms using biased ensembles give access to the low-probability region. Second, some kind of system-size extrapolation has to be performed.
  Here we demonstrate how rare-event importance sampling schemes can be combined with multi-histogram reweighting, which allows for rather general applicability of the approach, independent of specific sampling algorithms. We study two ways of performing the system-size extrapolation, either directly acting on the empirical rate functions, or on the scaled cumulant generating functions, to obtain the infinite-size limit. The presented method is demonstrated for a binomial distributed variable and the largest connected component in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs. Analytical solutions are available in both cases for direct comparison. It is observed in particular that phase transitions appearing in the biased ensembles can lead to systematic deviations from the true result.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the 3D Ising model in the infinite volume limit $N_{x,y,z}\to\infty$ by means of numerical simulations. We determine $T_c$ as well as the critical exponents $\beta,\gamma$ and $\nu$, based on finite-size scaling and histogram reweighting techniques. In addition, we study a ``dimensionally reduced'' scenario where $N_z$ is kept fixed (e.g. at 2, 4, 8), while the limit $N_{x,y}\to\infty$ is taken. For each fixed $N_z$ we determine $T_c$ as well as $\beta,\gamma,\nu$. For $T_c$ we find a smooth transition curve which connects the well known critical temperatures of the 2D and the 3D Ising model. Regarding $\beta,\gamma,\nu$ our data suggest that the ``dimensionally reduced'' Ising model is in the same universality class as the 2D Ising model, regardless of $N_z$.</description>

      <title>Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are however a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wavefunction elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wavepacket in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along a trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wavepacket, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.</description>

      <title>Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, it is important for many applications to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks.

      <title>Power spectrum of magnetic relaxation in spin ice: anomalous diffusion in a Coulomb fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetization noise measurements on the spin ice Dy${}_2$Ti${}_2$O${}_7$ have revealed a remarkable `pink noise' power spectrum $S(f,T)$ below 4 K, including evidence of magnetic monopole excitations diffusing in a fractal landscape. However, at higher temperatures, the reported values of the anomalous exponent $b(T)$ describing the high frequency tail of $S(f,T)$ are not easy to reconcile with other results in the literature, which generally suggest significantly smaller deviations from the Brownian motion value of $b=2$, that become negligible above $T=20$ K. We accurately estimate $b(T)$ at temperatures between 2~K and 20~K, using a.c. susceptibility measurements that, crucially, stretch up to the relatively high frequency of $f = 10^6$ Hz. We show that previous noise measurements underestimate $b(T)$ and we suggest reasons for this. Our results establish deviations in $b(T)$ from $b=2$ up to about 20 K. However studies on different samples confirms that $b(T)$ is sample dependent: the details of this dependence agree in part, though not completely, with previous studies of the effect of crystal defects on monopole population and diffusion. Our results establish the form of $b(T)$ which characterises the subtle, and evolving, nature of monopole diffusion in the dense Coulomb fluid, a highly correlated state, where several dynamical processes combine. They do not rule out the importance of a fractal landscape picture emerging at lower temperatures where the monopole gas is dilute.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-integrability in a non-Hermitian time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, exhibiting repeating patterns in time. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian Floquet systems can host a time crystalline phase with quasi-long-range order. In this work, we investigate the effect of introducing a non-integrable interaction term into this non-Hermitian time crystal model. Using a combination of numerical TEBD simulations, mean-field analysis, and perturbation theory, we find that the interaction term has two notable effects. First, it induces a shift in the phase diagram, moving the boundaries between different phases. Second, a sufficiently strong interaction induces an unexpected symmetry-breaking transition, which is not captured by the mean-field approach. Within average Hamiltonian theory, we trace this back to a ferromagnetic transition in the anisotropic non-Hermitian XXZ model. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and many-body interactions can lead to novel symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Interfacial and density fluctuations in a lattice model of motility-induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze motility-induced phase separation and bubbly phase separation in a two-dimensional lattice model of self-propelled particles. We compare systems where the dense (liquid) phase has slab and droplet geometries. We find that interfacial fluctuations of the slab are well-described by capillary wave theory, despite the existence of bubbles in the dense phase. We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss many-body fermionic and bosonic systems subject to dissipative particle losses in arbitrary spatial dimensions $d$, within the Keldysh path-integral formulation of the quantum master equation. This open quantum dynamics represents a generalisation of classical reaction-diffusion dynamics to the quantum realm. We first show how initial conditions can be introduced in the Keldysh path integral via boundary terms. We then study binary annihilation reactions $A+A\to\emptyset$, for which we derive a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The ensuing algebraic decay in time for the particle density depends on the particle statistics. In order to model possible experimental implementations with cold atoms, for fermions in $d=1$ we further discuss inhomogeneous cases involving the presence of a trapping potential. In this context, we quantify the irreversibility of the dynamics studying the time evolution of the system entropy for different quenches of the trapping potential. We find that the system entropy features algebraic decay for confining quenches, while it saturates in deconfined scenarios.</description>

      <title>Convergence properties of Markov models for image generation with applications to spin-flip dynamics and to diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of Markov models for image generation, the main idea is to learn how non-trivial images are gradually destroyed by a trivial forward Markov dynamics over the large time window $[0,t]$ converging towards pure noise for $t \to + \infty$, and to implement the non-trivial backward time-dependent Markov dynamics over the same time window $[0,t]$ starting from pure noise at $t$ in order to generate new images at time $0$. The goal of the present paper is to analyze the convergence properties of this reconstructive backward dynamics as a function of the time $t$ using the spectral properties of the trivial continuous-time forward dynamics for the $N$ pixels $n=1,..,N$. The general framework is applied to two cases : (i) when each pixel $n$ has only two states $S_n=\pm 1$ with Markov jumps between them; (ii) when each pixel $n$ is characterized by a continuous variable $x_n$ that diffuses on an interval $]x_-,x_+[$ that can be either finite or infinite.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, using \textit{hydrodynamic entropy} we quantify the multiscale disorder in Euler and hydrodynamic turbulence. These examples illustrate that the hydrodynamic entropy is not extensive because it is not proportional to the system size. Consequently, we cannot add hydrodynamic and thermodynamic entropies, which measure disorder at macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. In this paper, we also discuss the hydrodynamic entropy for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations of non-reciprocal systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems can be thought of as disobeying Newtons third law - an action does not cause an equal and opposite reaction. In recent years there has been a dramatic rise in interest towards such systems. On a fundamental level, they can be a basis of describing non-equilibrium and active states of matter, with applications ranging from physics to social sciences. However, often the first step to understanding complex nonlinear models is to linearize about the steady states. It is thus useful to develop a careful understanding of linear non-reciprocal systems, similar to our understanding of Gaussian systems in equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this work we explore simplest linear non-reciprocal models with noise and spatial extent. We describe their regions of stability and show how non-reciprocity can enhance the stability of a system. We demonstrate the appearance of exceptional and critical exceptional points with the respective enhancement of fluctuations for the latter. We show how strong non-reciprocity can lead to a finite-momentum instability. Finally, we comment how non-reciprocity can be a source of colored, $1/f$ type noise.</description>

      <title>Critical heat current fluctuations in Curie-Weiss model in and out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the analyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess whether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat current fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This model exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the magnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the heat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which vanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with system size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic scaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the magnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not diverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of equilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close to the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current values. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size, while the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point. Finally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current fluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a path integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective two-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic states involved in the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In physics we often use very simple models to describe systems with many degrees of freedom, but it is not clear why or how this success can be transferred to the more complex biological context. We consider models for the joint distribution of many variables, as with the combinations of spiking and silence in large networks of neurons. In this probabilistic framework, we argue that simple models are possible if the mutual information between two halves of the system is consistently sub--extensive, and if this shared information is compressible. These conditions are not met generically, but they are met by real world data such as natural images and the activity in a population of retinal output neurons. We introduce compression strategies that combine the information bottleneck with an iteration scheme inspired by the renormalization group, and find that the number of parameters needed to describe the distribution of joint activity scales with the square of the number of neurons, even though the interactions are not well approximated as pairwise. Our results also show that this shared information is essentially equal to the information that individual neurons carry about natural visual inputs, which has surprising implications for the neural code.</description>

Abstract: The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings [2014] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that the recently discovered families of constant-rate and linear-distance QLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain. Following our recently developed analytical theory for the athermal limit, here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to under-constrained systems at finite temperatures. Close to the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles the partition sum for a broad class of under-constrained systems, from which we obtain analytic expressions for elastic material properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ in terms of isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, shear strain $\gamma$, and temperature $T$. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain. We provide analytical expressions for these parameters based on the microscopic structure of the system. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation, a Neural Mass Network Model, treats different subcortical regions of the brain as connected nodes, with connections representing various types of structural, functional, or effective neuronal connectivity between these regions. Each region comprises interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells, consistent with the standard Wilson-Cowan model. By incorporating stable attractors into such a metapopulation model's dynamics, we transform it into a learning algorithm capable of achieving high image and text classification accuracy. We test it on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, in combination with convolutional neural networks, on CIFAR-10 and TF-FLOWERS, and, in combination with a transformer architecture (BERT), on IMDB, always showing high classification accuracy. These numerical evaluations illustrate that minimal modifications to the Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation can reveal unique and previously unobserved dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new quantum mechanical distribution function $n^I(\varepsilon)$, is derived for the condition $n \ge g$, where in contrast to the exclusion principle $n \le g$ for fermions, each energy state must be populated by at least one particle. Although the particles share many features with bosons, the anomalous behavior of $n^I(\varepsilon)$ precludes Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) due to the required occupancy of the excited states, which creates a permanently pressurized background at $T=0$, similar to the degeneracy pressure of fermions. An exhaustive classification scheme is presented for both distinguishable and indistinguishable, particles and energy levels based on Richard Stanley's twelvefold way in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states.
