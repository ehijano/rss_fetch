      <title>Interfacing Quantum Spin Hall and Quantum Anomalous Hall insulators: Bi bilayer on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-family materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting of non-trivial topology with magnetism results in novel phases of matter, such as Quantum Anomalous Hall (QAH) or axion insulator phases. Even more exotic states with high and tunable Chern numbers are expected at the contact of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (IMTIs) and 2D topological insulators (TIs).Here we synthesize a heterostructures composed of 2D TI and 3D IMTIs, specifically of bismuth bilayer on top of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-family of compounds and study their electronic properties by means of angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The epitaxial interface is characterized by hybridized Bi and IMTI electronic states. The Bi bilayer-derived states on different members of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-family of materials are similar, except in the region of mixing with the topological surface states of the substrate. In that region, the new, substrate dependent interface Dirac state is observed. Our \emph{ab initio} calculations show rich interface phases with emergence of exchange split 1D edge states, making the Bi/IMTI heterostructures promising playground for observation of novel members in the family of quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of thin parahydrogen films on graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-temperature properties of one and two layers of parahydrogen adsorbed on graphite are investigated theoretically through Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We adopt a microscopic model that explicitly includes the corrugation of the substrate. We study the phase diagram of a monolayer up to second layer promotion, and the possible occurrence of superfluidity in the second layer. We obtain results down to a temperature as low as 8 mK. We find second-layer promotion to occur at a considerably greater coverage than obtained in previous calculations and estimated experimentally; moreover, we find no evidence of a possible finite superfluid response in the second layer, disproving recent theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Adsorbate Dissociation Due to Heteromolecular Electronic Energy Transfer from Fluorobenzene Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Study of the near-UV photodissociation dynamics for monolayer (ML) quantities of CH$_3$I on thin films of a series of fluorobenzenes and benzene (1--25ML) grown on a Cu(100) substrate finds that in addition to gas-phase-like neutral photodissociation, CH$_3$I dissociation can be enhanced via photoabsorption in several of the thin films studied. Distinct CH$_3$ photofragment kinetic energy distributions are found for CH$_3$I photodissociation on C$_6$H$_5$F, 1,4-C$_6$H$_4$F$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ thin films, and distinguished from neutral photodissociation pathways using polarized incident light. The effective photodissociation cross section for CH$_3$I on these thin films is increased as compared to that for the higher F-count fluorobenzene thin films due to the additional photodissociation pathway available. Quenching by the metal substrate of the photoexcitation via this new pathway suggests a significantly longer timescale for excitation than that of neutral CH$_3$I photodissociation. The observations support a mechanism in which neutral photoexcitation in the thin film (i.e. an exciton) is transported to the interface with CH$_3$I, and transferring the electronic excitation to the CH$_3$I which then dissociates. The unimodal CH$_3$ photofragment distribution and observed kinetic energies on the fluorobenzene thin films suggest that the dissociation occurs via the $^3Q_1$ excited state of CH$_3$I.</description>

      <title>Multi-State, Ultra-thin, BEOL-Compatible AlScN Ferroelectric Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth in data generation necessitates efficient data processing technologies to address the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional computer architecture. Memory-driven computing, which integrates non-volatile memory (NVM) devices in a 3D stack, is gaining attention, with CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible ferroelectric (FE) diodes being ideal due to their two-terminal design and inherently selector-free nature, facilitating high-density crossbar arrays. Here, we demonstrate BEOL-compatible, high-performance FE-diodes scaled to 5, 10, and 20 nm FE Al0.72Sc0.28N/Al0.64Sc0.36N films. Through interlayer (IL) engineering, we show substantial improvements in the ON/OFF ratios (&gt;166 times) and rectification ratios (&gt;176 times) in these scaled devices. The superlative characteristics also enables 5-bit multi-state operation with a stable retention. We also experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the counterintuitive result that the inclusion of an IL can lead to a decrease in the ferroelectric switching voltage of the device. An in-depth analysis into the device transport mechanisms is performed, and our compact model aligns seamlessly with the experimental results. Our results suggest the possibility of using scaled AlxSc1-xN FE-diodes for high performance, low-power, embedded NVM.</description>

      <title>Higher Derivative Muffin Tin Orbitals (HDMTO) and Higher Derivative Koringa Khon and Rostoker (HDKKR) methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a Linearized version of the Koringa Khon and Rostoker method (LKKR) and show it to be equivalent to the Linearized Muffin Tin Orbitals method (LMTO). We then present higher derivative versions of both methods, e.g. HDKKR and HDMTO and show them to be partially distinct (not equivalent). In particular HDKKR basis set does not have an equivalent ground state for the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian as the HDKKR basis set and has greater variational power than the HDMTO one. Because the KS method, for Density Functional Theory (DFT), is variational HDKKR will give better ground state energies than HDMTO. However HDKKR is much harder to work with then HDMTO requiring much greater computer resources so HDMTO can often be preferred.</description>

      <title>Overhead-constrained circuit knitting for variational quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of large quantum systems is a formidable yet vital pursuit for obtaining a deeper understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena. While quantum computers hold great promise for speeding up such simulations, their practical application remains hindered by limited scale and pervasive noise. In this work, we propose an approach that addresses these challenges by employing circuit knitting to partition a large quantum system into smaller subsystems that can each be simulated on a separate device. The evolution of the system is governed by the projected variational quantum dynamics (PVQD) algorithm, supplemented with constraints on the parameters of the variational quantum circuit, ensuring that the sampling overhead imposed by the circuit knitting scheme remains controllable. We test our method on quantum spin systems with multiple weakly entangled blocks each consisting of strongly correlated spins, where we are able to accurately simulate the dynamics while keeping the sampling overhead manageable. Further, we show that the same method can be used to reduce the circuit depth by cutting long-ranged gates.</description>
