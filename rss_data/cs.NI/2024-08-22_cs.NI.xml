      <title>Power-Domain Interference Graph Estimation for Multi-hop BLE Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11499v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional wisdom for network management allocates network resources separately for the measurement and communication tasks. Heavy measurement tasks may compete limited resources with communication tasks and significantly degrade overall network performance. It is therefore challenging for the interference graph, deemed as incurring heavy measurement overhead, to be used in practice in wireless networks. To address this challenge in wireless sensor networks, our core insight is to use power as a new dimension for interference graph estimation (IGE) such that IGE can be done simultaneously with the communication tasks using the same frequency-time resources. We propose to marry power-domain IGE with concurrent flooding to achieve simultaneous measurement and communication in BLE networks, where the power linearity prerequisite for power-domain IGE holds naturally true in concurrent flooding. With extensive experiments, we conclude the necessary conditions for the power linearity to hold and analyze several nonlinearity issues of power related to hardware imperfections. We design and implement network protocols and power control algorithms for IGE in multi-hop BLE networks and conduct experiments to show that the marriage is mutually beneficial for both IGE and concurrent flooding. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of IGE in improving channel map convergence and convergecast in BLE networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing QoS in HD Map Updates: Cross-Layer Multi-Agent with Hierarchical and Independent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data collected by autonomous vehicle (AV) sensors such as LiDAR and cameras is crucial for creating high-definition (HD) maps to provide higher accuracy and enable a higher level of automation. Nevertheless, offloading this large volume of raw data to edge servers leads to increased latency due to network congestion in highly dense environments such as Vehicular Adhoc networks (VANET). To address this challenge, researchers have focused on the dynamic allocation of minimum contention window (CWmin) value. While this approach could be sufficient for fairness, it might not be adequate for prioritizing different services, as it also involves other parameters such as maximum contention window (CWmax) and infer-frame space number (IFSn). In response to this, we extend the scope of previous solutions to include the control of not only CWmin but also the adjustment of two other parameters in the standard IEEE802.11: CWmax and IFSn, alongside waiting transmission time. To achieve this, we introduced a methodology involving a cross-layer solution between the application and MAC layers. Additionally, we utilised multi-agent techniques, emphasising a hierarchical structure and independent learning (IL) to improve latency to efficiently handle map updates while interacting with multiple services. This approach demonstrated an improvement in latency against the standard IEEE802.11p EDCA by $31\%$, $49\%$, $87.3\%$, and $64\%$ for Voice, Video, HD Map, and Best-effort, respectively.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Secure UE-to-UE Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of current cryptographic systems, including those used in User Equipment (UE) for mobile communications. Conventional cryptographic algorithms such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks, which could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data transmitted by UEs. This demo paper proposes the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in TLS for UE Communication to mitigate the risks of quantum attacks. We present our setup and explain each of the components used. We also provide the entire workflow of the demo for other researchers to replicate the same setup. By addressing the implementation of PQC within a 5G network to secure UE-to-UE communication, this research aims to pave the way for developing quantum-resistant mobile devices and securing the future of wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Security Evaluation in Software-Defined Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud computing has grown in importance in recent years which has led to a significant increase in Data Centre (DC) network requirements. A major driver of this change is virtualisation, which allows computing resources to be deployed on a large scale. However, traditional DCs, with their network topology and proliferation of network endpoints, are struggling to meet the flexible, centrally managed requirements of cloud computing applications. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) promise to offer a solution to these growing networking requirements by separating control functions from data routing. This shift adds more flexibility to networks but also introduces new security issues. This article presents a framework for evaluating security of SDN architectures. In addition, through an experimental study, we demonstrate how this framework can identify the threats and vulnerabilities, calculate their risks and severity, and provide the necessary measures to mitigate them. The proposed framework helps administrators to evaluate SDN security, address identified threats and meet network security requirements.</description>

      <title>5G NR PRACH Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Overcoming Cell Interference Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to interference detection in 5G New Radio (5G-NR) networks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Interference in 5G networks challenges high-quality service due to dense user equipment deployment and increased wireless environment complexity. Our CNN-based model is designed to detect Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) sequences amidst various interference scenarios, leveraging the spatial and temporal characteristics of PRACH signals to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive datasets of simulated PRACH signals under controlled interference conditions were generated to train and validate the model. Experimental results show that our CNN-based approach outperforms traditional PRACH detection methods in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. This study demonstrates the potential of AI/ML techniques in advancing interference management in 5G networks, providing a foundation for future research and practical applications in optimizing network performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Anteumbler: Non-Invasive Antenna Orientation Error Measurement for WiFi APs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of WiFi-based localization systems is affected by the spatial accuracy of WiFi AP. Compared with the imprecision of AP location and antenna separation, the imprecision of AP's or antenna's orientation is more important in real scenarios, including AP rotation and antenna irregular tilt. In this paper, we propose Anteumbler that non-invasively, accurately and efficiently measures the orientation of each antenna in physical space. Based on the fact that the received power is maximized when a Tx-Rx antenna pair is perfectly aligned, we construct a spatial angle model that can obtain the antennas' orientations without prior knowledge. However, the sampling points of traversing the spatial angle need to cover the entire space. We use the orthogonality of antenna directivity and polarization and adopt an iterative algorithm to reduce the sampling points by hundreds of times, which greatly improves the efficiency. To achieve the required antenna orientation accuracy, we eliminate the influence of propagation distance using a dual plane intersection model and filter out ambient noise. Our real-world experiments with six antenna types, two antenna layouts and two antenna separations show that Anteumbler achieves median errors below 6 degree for both elevation and azimuth angles, and is robust to NLoS and dynamic environments. Last but not least, for the reverse localization system, we deploy Anteumbler over LocAP and reduce the antenna separation error by 10 mm, while for the user localization system, we deploy Anteumbler over SpotFi and reduce the user localization error by more than 1 m.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Fine-Tuned Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-Context Support: For 3GPP Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with technical standards in telecommunications. We propose a fine-tuned retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on the Phi-2 small language model (SLM) to serve as an oracle for communication networks. Our developed system leverages forward-looking semantic chunking to adaptively determine parsing breakpoints based on embedding similarity, enabling effective processing of diverse document formats. To handle the challenge of multiple similar contexts in technical standards, we employ a re-ranking algorithm to prioritize the most relevant retrieved chunks. Recognizing the limitations of Phi-2's small context window, we implement a recent technique, namely SelfExtend, to expand the context window during inference, which not only boosts the performance but also can accommodate a wider range of user queries and design requirements from customers to specialized technicians. For fine-tuning, we utilize the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique to enhance computational efficiency during training and enable effective fine-tuning on small datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing question-answering approaches in the telecom domain, achieving performance that exceeds larger language models such as GPT-4 (which is about 880 times larger in size). This work presents a novel approach to leveraging SLMs for communication networks, offering a balance of efficiency and performance. This work can serve as a foundation towards agentic language models for networks.</description>

      <title>Edge AI as a Service with Coordinated Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to expand in next-generation networks, there is a growing need for deep neural network (DNN) models. Although DNN models deployed at the edge are promising for providing AI as a service with low latency, their cooperation is yet to be explored. In this paper, we consider that DNN service providers share their computing resources as well as their models' parameters and allow other DNNs to offload their computations without mirroring. We propose a novel algorithm called coordinated DNNs on edge (\textbf{CoDE}) that facilitates coordination among DNN services by establishing new inference paths. CoDE aims to find the optimal path, which is the path with the highest possible reward, by creating multi-task DNNs from individual models. The reward reflects the inference throughput and model accuracy. With CoDE, DNN models can make new paths for inference by using their own or other models' parameters. We then evaluate the performance of CoDE through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate a $40\%$ increase in the inference throughput while degrading the average accuracy by only $2.3\%$. Experiments show that CoDE enhances the inference throughput and, achieves higher precision compared to a state-of-the-art existing method.</description>

      <title>PACP: Priority-Aware Collaborative Perception for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrounding perceptions are quintessential for safe driving for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), where the Bird's Eye View has been employed to accurately capture spatial relationships among vehicles. However, severe inherent limitations of BEV, like blind spots, have been identified. Collaborative perception has emerged as an effective solution to overcoming these limitations through data fusion from multiple views of surrounding vehicles. While most existing collaborative perception strategies adopt a fully connected graph predicated on fairness in transmissions, they often neglect the varying importance of individual vehicles due to channel variations and perception redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Priority-Aware Collaborative Perception (PACP) framework to employ a BEV-match mechanism to determine the priority levels based on the correlation between nearby CAVs and the ego vehicle for perception. By leveraging submodular optimization, we find near-optimal transmission rates, link connectivity, and compression metrics. Moreover, we deploy a deep learning-based adaptive autoencoder to modulate the image reconstruction quality under dynamic channel conditions. Finally, we conduct extensive studies and demonstrate that our scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes by 8.27\% and 13.60\%, respectively, in terms of utility and precision of the Intersection over Union.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Resource Allocation and Control in Data Centers: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data centers have become ubiquitous for today's businesses. From banks to startups, they rely on cloud infrastructure to deploy user applications. In this context, it is vital to provide users with application performance guarantees. Network interference is one of the causes of unpredictable application performance, and many solutions have been proposed over the years. The main objective of this survey is to familiarize the reader with research into network measurement-based resource allocation and control in data centers, focusing on network resources in order to provide cloud performance guarantees. We start with a primer on general network measurement techniques and data center network and applications to give the reader context. We then summarize the characteristics of network traffic and cluster workloads in data centers, which are pivotal for measurement-based allocation and control. We study and compare network monitoring in data centers, giving an overview on their evolution from Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to programmable dataplanes-based. The network monitoring information can serve as input to cluster allocation and scheduling decisions. We next categorize cluster scheduling frameworks, and perform an analysis of those that provide network guarantees in data centers, and we also look at emergent Machine Learning-driven resource allocation and control. We conclude with a discussion about future research directions.</description>

      <title>Joint Constellation Shaping Using Gradient Descent Approach for MU-MIMO Broadcast Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a learning-based approach to optimize a joint constellation for a multi-user MIMO broadcast channel ($T$ Tx antennas, $K$ users, each with $R$ Rx antennas), with perfect channel knowledge. The aim of the optimizer (MAX-MIN) is to maximize the minimum mutual information between the  transmitter and each receiver, under a sum-power constraint. The proposed optimization method do neither impose the transmitter to use superposition coding (SC) or any other linear precoding, nor to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Instead, the approach designs a joint constellation, optimized such that its projection into the subspace of each receiver $k$, maximizes the minimum mutual information $I(W_k;Y_k)$ between each transmitted binary input $W_k$ and the output signal at the intended receiver $Y_k$. The rates obtained by our method are compared to those achieved with linear precoders.</description>
