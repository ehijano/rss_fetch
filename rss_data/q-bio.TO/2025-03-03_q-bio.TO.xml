      <title>Reliability of characterising coronary artery flow with the flow-split outflow strategy: comparison against the multiscale approach</title>

Abstract: In computational modelling of coronary haemodynamics, imposing patient-specific flow conditions is paramount, yet often impractical due to resource and time constraints, limiting the ability to perform a large number of simulations particularly for diseased cases. We aimed to compare coronary haemodynamics quantified using a simplified flow-split strategy with varying exponents against the clinically verified but computationally intensive multiscale simulations under both resting and hyperaemic conditions in arteries with varying degrees of stenosis.
  Six patient-specific left coronary artery trees were segmented and reconstructed, including three with severe (&gt;70%) and three with mild (&lt;50%) focal stenoses. Simulations were performed for the entire coronary tree to account for the flow-limiting effects from epicardial artery stenoses. Both a 0D-3D coupled multiscale model and a flow-split approach with four different exponents (2.0, 2.27, 2.33, and 3.0) were used. The resulting prominent haemodynamic metrics were statistically compared between the two methods.
  Flow-split and multiscale simulations did not significantly differ under resting conditions regardless of the stenosis severity. However, under hyperaemic conditions, the flow-split method significantly overestimated the time-averaged wall shear stress by up to 16.8 Pa (p=0.031) and underestimate the fractional flow reserve by 0.327 (p=0.043), with larger discrepancies observed in severe stenoses than in mild ones. Varying the exponent from 2.0 to 3.0 within the flow-split methods did not significantly affect the haemodynamic results (p&gt;0.141).
  Flow-split strategies with exponents between 2.0 and 3.0 are appropriate for modelling stenosed coronaries under resting conditions. Multiscale simulations are recommended for accurate modelling of hyperaemic conditions, especially in severely stenosed arteries.</description>

      <title>Modeling cell differentiation in neuroblastoma: insights into development, malignancy, and treatment relapse</title>

Abstract: Neuroblastoma is a paediatric extracranial solid cancer that arises from the developing sympathetic nervous system and is characterised by an abnormal distribution of cell types in tumours compared to healthy infant tissues. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model of cell differentiation during sympathoadrenal development. By performing Bayesian inference of the model parameters using clinical data from patient samples, we show that the model successfully accounts for the observed differences in cell type heterogeneity among healthy adrenal tissues and four common types of neuroblastomas. Using a phenotypically structured model, we show that alterations in healthy differentiation dynamics are related to cell malignancy, and tumour volume growth. We use this model to analyse the evolution of malignant traits in a tumour. Our findings suggest that normal development dynamics make the embryonic sympathetic nervous system more robust to perturbations and accumulation of malignancies, and that the diversity of differentiation dynamics found in the neuroblastoma subtypes lead to unique risk profiles for neuroblastoma relapse after treatment.</description>
