      <title>A Novel Soil Profile Standardization Technique with XGBoost Framework for Accurate Surface Wave Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inversion of surface wave dispersion curves poses significant challenges due to the non-uniqueness, nonlinear, &amp; ill-posed nature of the problem. Local search methods get trapped in suboptimal minima, whereas global search methods are computationally intensive. The CPU time becomes challenging when dealing with a large number of traces, such as 2D/3D surface wave surveys or DAS surveys. Several attempts have been made to perform inversion using machine learning to improve accuracy and reduce CPU times. Current machine learning methods rely on a fixed number of soil layers in the training dataset to maintain a consistent output size, limiting these models to predicting only a narrow range of soil profiles. Consequently, no single machine learning model can effectively predict soil profiles with a wide range of shear wave velocities and varying numbers of layers. The present study introduces a novel soil profile standardization technique and proposes a regression-based XGBoost algorithm to efficiently estimate shear wave velocity profiles for stratified media with a varying number of layers. The proposed model is trained using 10 million synthetic soil profiles. This extensive dataset enables our XGBoost model to learn effectively across a wide range of shear wave velocities. Additionally, the study proposes constraints on the differences in shear wave velocities between consecutive layers and on their ratio with layer thickness, preventing the formation of unrealistic layers and ensuring the predictive model reflects real-world conditions. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated by adopting a wide range of soil profiles from published literature and comparing the results with traditional inversion methods. The model performs well in a wide range of S-wave velocities and can accurately capture any number of layers of the soil profile during the inversion process</description>

      <title>Dynamic Heterogeneity and Facilitation in Sheared Granular Materials: Insights from 3D Triaxial Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21156</link>

Abstract: Strain localization in granular materials arises from complex microscale dynamics, including intermittent particle rearrangements and spatiotemporally correlated deformation. While dynamic heterogeneity (DH) and dynamic facilitation (DF) have been widely studied in two-dimensional amorphous materials, their prevalence in three-dimensional (3D) granular systems remains unclear. Here, we performed a 3D triaxial compression test with in-situ X-ray computed tomography to track particle-scale kinematics across small and large strain increments. We analyzed deviatoric strain, volumetric strain, and non-affine motion fields, computed four-point spatial dynamic correlation functions to probe DH, quantified DF through a facilitation ratio, and assessed temporal persistence of local dynamics using four-point temporal dynamic correlations. Across large strain increments, DH and DF emerge strongly in the transition regime between the initially elastic response and the critical state regime, but weaken or become statistically insignificant within the shear band at the critical state, indicating a qualitative change in microscale dynamics upon localization. In contrast, under small increments, both measures are suppressed across all regimes. These results demonstrate that correlated dynamics depend strongly on both strain increment and deformation regime. This work provides the first comprehensive investigation of DH and DF in 3D granular materials and highlights their strain-increment and regime-dependent behaviors, establishing a connection to glassy dynamics in amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Observations of high-frequency spectral peaks from in-situ waves in ice data: evidence for nonlinear waves in ice triad interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19034</link>

Abstract: The propagation of waves through the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and deeper into pack ice is a key phenomenon that influences the breakup and drift of sea ice. When waves in ice propagate through a solid, non-cracked, thick enough sea ice cover, significant flexural elastic effects can be present in the dispersion relation. This results in a dispersion relation that opens up for 3-wave interactions, also known as wave triads.
  Here, we report the observation of high-frequency spectral peaks in the power spectral density of waves in ice spectra. We show, in two timeseries datasets, that the presence of these high-frequency peaks is accompanied by high values for the spectral bicoherence. This is a signature that the high-frequency peak is phase-locked with frequency components in the main spectral energy peak, and a necessary condition for nonlinear coupling to take place. Moreover, we show for a timeseries dataset that includes several closely located sensors that the dispersion relation recovered from a cross-spectrum analysis is compatible with the possible existence of wave triads at the same frequencies for which the bicoherence peak is observed. In addition to these observations in timeseries datasets, we show that similar high-frequency peaks are observed from additional, independent datasets of waves in ice power spectrum densities transmitted over iridium from autonomous buoys.
  These results suggest that nonlinear energy transfers between wave in ice spectral components are likely to occur in some waves and sea ice conditions. This may enable redistribution of energy from weakly damped low-frequency waves to more strongly attenuated higher-frequency spectral components, which can contribute to energy dissipation in the ice.</description>
