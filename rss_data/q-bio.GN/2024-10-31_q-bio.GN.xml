      <title>Assessing Concordance between RNA-Seq and NanoString Technologies in Ebola-Infected Nonhuman Primates Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the concordance between RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and NanoString technologies for gene expression analysis in non-human primates (NHPs) infected with Ebola virus (EBOV). We performed a detailed comparison of both platforms, demonstrating a strong correlation between them, with Spearman coefficients for 56 out of 62 samples ranging from 0.78 to 0.88, with a mean of 0.83 and a median of 0.85. Bland-Altman analysis further confirmed high consistency, with most measurements falling within 95% confidence limits. A machine learning approach, using the Supervised Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (SMAS) method trained on NanoString data, identified OAS1 as a key marker for distinguishing RT-qPCR positive from negative samples. Remarkably, when applied to RNA-Seq data, OAS1 also achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating infected from uninfected samples using logistic regression, demonstrating its robustness across platforms. Further differential expression analysis identified 12 common genes including ISG15, OAS1, IFI44, IFI27, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI44L, MX1, MX2, OAS2, RSAD2, and OASL which demonstrated the highest levels of statistical significance and biological relevance across both platforms. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis confirmed that these genes are directly involved in key immune and viral infection pathways, reinforcing their importance in EBOV infection. In addition, RNA-Seq uniquely identified genes such as CASP5, USP18, and DDX60, which play key roles in immune regulation and antiviral defense. This finding highlights the broader detection capabilities of RNA-Seq and underscores the complementary strengths of both platforms in providing a comprehensive and accurate assessment of gene expression changes during Ebola virus infection.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Interpretable Factors with Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of machine learning models relies heavily on effectively representing high-dimensional data. However, ensuring data representations capture human-understandable concepts remains difficult, often requiring the incorporation of prior knowledge and decomposition of data into multiple subspaces. Traditional linear methods fall short in modeling more than one space, while more expressive deep learning approaches lack interpretability. Here, we introduce Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis ($\texttt{sisPCA}$), a PCA extension designed for multi-subspace learning. Leveraging the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), $\texttt{sisPCA}$ incorporates supervision and simultaneously ensures subspace disentanglement. We demonstrate $\texttt{sisPCA}$'s connections with autoencoders and regularized linear regression and showcase its ability to identify and separate hidden data structures through extensive applications, including breast cancer diagnosis from image features, learning aging-associated DNA methylation changes, and single-cell analysis of malaria infection. Our results reveal distinct functional pathways associated with malaria colonization, underscoring the essentiality of explainable representation in high-dimensional data analysis.</description>
