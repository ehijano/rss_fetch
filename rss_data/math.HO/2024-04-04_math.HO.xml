      <title>Patrick Moss 25/10/1947--17/3/2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patrick Moss (1947--2024) had two distinct lives as a mathematician. The first was as a ring theorist in the late 1970s, in which he worked with Ginn and Lenagan as a student. After a long career as an inspirational mathematics teacher, Patrick completed a doctorate under my supervision in 2003. This led to a second mathematical life in arithmetic dynamics almost forty years after his first period of research. This is a short obituary of his remarkable contributions, several of which have stimulated further research.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Asymptotic Limit Problems of Probabilistic Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convenient framework for dealing with asymptotic limit problems of probabilistic nature is provided. These problems include questions such as finding the asymptotic proportion of terms of a sequence falling inside a given interval, or the limit of the arithmetic mean of its partial sums; but several classes of problems are examined in a much more general setting. The proposed framework, which aims to unify those questions and their solution, is based on the idea that to any finite multiset $E_n$, one can associate a finitely distributed atomic probability $\mu_n$; assuming $\mu_n$ tends in distribution to a probability $\mu$, it provides the tools needed to establish the desired asymptotic limit. Few examples are worked out in order to illustrate how using the framework.</description>
