      <title>Effect of external potential on the energy transport in harmonically driven segmented Frenkel-Kontorova lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal resonance, that is, the heat flux obtained by means of a periodic external driving, offers the possibility of controlling heat flux in nanoscale devices suitable for power generation, cooling, and thermoelectrics among others. In this work we study the effect of the onsite potential period on the thermal resonance phenomenon present in a one-dimensional system composed of two dissimilar Frenkel-Kontorova lattices connected by a time-modulated coupling and in contact with two heat reservoirs operating at different temperature by means of molecular dynamics simulations. When the periods of the onsite potential on both sides of the system are equal the maximum resonance is obtained for the lowest considered value of the period. For highly structurally asymmetric lattices the heat flux toward the cold reservoir is maximized, and asymmetric periods of the onsite potential afford an extra way to control the magnitude of the heat fluxes in each side of the system. Our results highlight the importance of the substrate structure on thermal resonance and could inspire further developments in designing thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal rectification in segmented Frenkel-Kontorova lattices with asymmetric next-nearest-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we conduct an extensive study of the asymmetric heat flow, i.e. thermal rectification, present in the two-segment Frenkel Kontorova model with both nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions. We have considered systems with both high and low asymmetry and determined that, in the weak-coupling limit, thermal rectification is larger when NNN interactions are relevant. The behavior of the heat fluxes as a function of the coupling strength between the two segments is largely consistent with a well-defined rectification for larger system sizes. The local heat fluxes present a very different behavior for systems with high and low asymmetry. The results of this work may help in the design of molecular bridges, which have recently been shown to be able to function as thermal rectification devices.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy inference of reaction-diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion equations are commonly used to model a diverse array of complex systems, including biological, chemical, and physical processes. Typically, these models are phenomenological, requiring the fitting of parameters to experimental data. In the present work, we introduce a novel formalism to construct reaction-diffusion models that is grounded in the principle of maximum entropy. This new formalism aims to incorporate various types of experimental data, including ensemble currents, distributions at different points in time, or moments of such. To this end, we expand the framework of Schr\"odinger bridges and Maximum Caliber problems to nonlinear interacting systems. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by modeling the evolution of (i) a morphogen across the fin of a zebrafish and (ii) the population of two varieties of toads in Poland, so as to match the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Equation and Rare Fluctuations of the Biased ACTRW Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the fractional advection-diffusion equation and rare events associated with the ACTRW model. When waiting times have a finite mean but infinite variance, and the displacements follow a narrow distribution, the fractional operator is defined in terms of space rather than time. The far tail of the positional distribution is governed by rare events, which exhibit a different scaling compared to typical fluctuations. Additionally, we establish a strong relationship between the number of renewals and the positional distribution in the context of large deviations. Throughout the manuscript, the theoretical results are validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Heat exchange for oscillator strongly coupled to thermal bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heat exchange fluctuation theorem (XFT) by Jarzynski and W\'ojcik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 230602 (2004)] addresses the setting where two systems with different temperatures are brought in thermal contact at time $t=0$ and then disconnected at later time $\tau$. The theorem asserts that the probability of an anomalous heat flux (from cold to hot), while nonzero, is exponentially smaller than the probability of the corresponding normal flux (from hot to cold). As a result, the average heat flux is always normal. In that way, the theorem demonstrates how irreversible heat transfer, observed on the macroscopic scale, emerges from the underlying reversible dynamics. The XFT was proved under the assumption that the coupling work required to connect and then disconnect the systems is small compared to the change of the internal energies of the systems. That condition is often valid for macroscopic systems, but may be violated for microscopic ones. We examine the validity of the XFT's assumption for a specific model of the Caldeira-Leggett type, where one system is a classical harmonic oscillator and the other is a thermal bath comprised of a large number of oscillators. The coupling between the system and the bath, which is bilinear, is instantaneously turned on at $t=0$ and off at $t=\tau$. For that model, we found that the assumption of the XFT can be satisfied only for a rather restricted range of parameters. In general, the work involved in the process is not negligible and the energy exchange may be anomalous in the sense that the internal energy of the system, which is initially hotter than the bath, may further increase.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>An EFT for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets: gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones, and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a "spin flop" phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Disentanglers on Random Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for efficient disentanglers on random Clifford circuits of two-qubit gates arranged in a brick-wall pattern, using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm \cite{schulman2017proximalpolicyoptimizationalgorithms}. Disentanglers are defined as a set of projective measurements inserted between consecutive entangling layers. An efficient disentangler is a set of projective measurements that minimize the averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state with the least number of total projections possible. The problem is naturally amenable to reinforcement learning techniques by taking the binary matrix representing the projective measurements along the circuit as our state, and actions as bit flipping operations on this binary matrix that add or delete measurements at specified locations. We give rewards to our agent dependent on the averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state and the configuration of measurements, such that the agent learns the optimal policy that will take him from the initial state of no measurements to the optimal measurement state that minimizes the entanglement entropy. Our results indicate that the number of measurements required to disentangle a random quantum circuit is drastically less than the numerical results of measurement-induced phase transition papers. Additionally, the reinforcement learning procedure enables us to characterize the pattern of optimal disentanglers, which is not possible in the works of measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry and symmetry defects in boundary conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A state in a quantum system with a given global symmetry, $G$, can be sensitive to the presence of boundaries, which may either preserve or break this symmetry. In this work, we investigate how conformal invariant boundary conditions influence the $G-$symmetry breaking through the lens of the entanglement asymmetry, a quantifier of the "distance" between a symmetry-broken state and its symmetrized counterpart. By leveraging 2D boundary conformal field theory (BCFT), we investigate the symmetry breaking for both finite and compact Lie groups. Beyond the leading order term, we also compute the subleading corrections in the subsystem size, highlighting their dependence on the symmetry group $G$ and the BCFT operator content. We further explore the entanglement asymmetry following a global quantum quench, where a symmetry-broken state evolves under a symmetry-restoring Hamiltonian. In this dynamical setting, we compute the entanglement asymmetry by extending the method of images to a BCFT with non-local objects such as invertible symmetry defects.</description>

      <title>Distribution Function for $n \ge g$ Quantum Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new quantum mechanical distribution function $n^I(\varepsilon)$, is derived for the condition $n \ge g$, where in contrast to the exclusion principle $n \le g$ for fermions, each energy state must be populated by at least one particle. Although the particles share many features with bosons, the anomalous behavior of $n^I(\varepsilon)$ precludes Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) due to the required occupancy of the excited states, which creates a permanently pressurized background at $T=0$, similar to the degeneracy pressure of fermions. An exhaustive classification scheme is presented for both distinguishable and indistinguishable, particles and energy levels based on Richard Stanley's twelvefold way in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Escape-from-a-layer approach for simulating the boundary local time in Euclidean domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient numerical approach to simulate the boundary local time, as well as the time and position of the associated reaction event on a smooth boundary of a Euclidean domain. This approach combines the standard walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with the approximate solution of the escape problem in the boundary layer. In this way, the most time-consuming simulation of reflected Brownian motion near the boundary is replaced by an equivalent escape event. We validate the proposed escape-from-a-layer approach by comparing simulated statistics of the boundary local time with exact results known for simple domains (a disk, a circular annulus, a sphere, a spherical shell) and with the numerical results obtained by a finite-element method in more sophisticated domains. This approach offers a powerful tool for simulating diffusive processes in confinements and for solving the related partial differential equations. Its applications in the context of diffusion-controlled reactions in chemical physics are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of the entanglement asymmetry in the ground state of a (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary condition that explicitly breaks a bulk symmetry. Our focus is on the asymmetry of a subsystem $A$ originating from the symmetry-breaking boundary and extending into a semi-infinite bulk. By employing the twist field formalism, we derive a universal expression for the asymmetry, showing that the asymptotic behavior for large subsystems is approached algebraically, with an exponent which is twice the conformal dimension of a boundary condition-changing operator. As a secondary result, we also establish a similar asymptotic behavior for the string order parameter. Our exact analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations in the critical Ising and 3-state Potts models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the onset of Anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in the form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. Analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the Anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. Performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular Anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. Our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum wires with local particle loss: Transport manifestations of fluctuation-induced effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of a quantum wire of weakly interacting fermions in the presence of local particle loss. We calculate current and conductance in this system due to applied external chemical potential bias that can be measured in experimental realizations of ultracold fermions in quasi one-dimensional traps. Using a Keldysh field theory approach based on the Lindblad equation, we establish a perturbative scheme to study the effect of imbalanced reservoirs. Logarithmically divergent terms are resummed using a renormalization group method, and a novel powerlaw behavior for the conductance as a function of the potential bias across the wire is found. In contrast to the equilibrium case of a potential barrier in a Luttinger liquid, the conductance exhibits a scaling behavior, which depends on the interaction strength and on the loss probability. Repulsive interactions reduce the conductance of the wire while attractive interactions enhance it. However, perfect reflectivity and transparency are only reached in the absence of particle loss.</description>

      <title>The SIS process on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs: determining the infected fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many methods to estimate the quasi-stationary infected fraction of the SIS process on (random) graphs. A challenge is to adequately incorporate correlations, which is especially important in sparse graphs. Methods typically are either significantly biased in sparse graphs, or computationally very demanding already for small network sizes. The former applies to Heterogeneous Mean Field and to the N-intertwined Mean Field Approximation, the latter to most higher order approximations. In this paper we present a new method to determine the infected fraction in sparse graphs, which we test on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Our method is based on degree-pairs, does take into account correlations and gives accurate estimates. At the same time, computations are very feasible and can easily be done even for large networks.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Bound for Canonical Nonlinearity Under Single-Shot Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We derive the bound for the extended nonlinearity in nonequilibrium state, characterized by the nonlinearity in equilibrium state, Renyi divergences between equilibrium and nonequilibrium distribution, temperature and work.</description>

      <title>Atomic evolution of hydrogen intercalation wave dynamics in palladium nanocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solute-intercalation-induced phase separation creates spatial heterogeneities in host materials, a phenomenon ubiquitous in batteries, hydrogen storage, and other energy devices. Despite many efforts, probing intercalation processes at the atomic scale has been a significant challenge. We study hydrogen (de)intercalation in palladium nanocrystals as a model system and achieve atomic-resolution imaging of hydrogen intercalation wave dynamics by utilizing liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that intercalation wave mechanisms, instead of shrinking-core mechanisms, prevail at ambient temperature for palladium nanocubes ranging from ~60 nm down to ~10 nm. We uncover the atomic evolution of hydrogen intercalation wave transitioning from non-planar and inclined boundaries to those closely aligned with {100} planes. Our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the observed intercalation wave dynamics correspond to sorption pathways minimizing the lattice mismatch strain at the phase boundary. Unveiling the atomic intercalation pathways holds profound implications for engineering intercalation-mediated devices and advancements in energy sciences.</description>

      <title>The inviscid fixed point of the multi-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new scaling regime characterized by a $z=1$ dynamical critical exponent has been reported in several numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and noisy Burgers equations. In these works, this scaling, differing from the well-known KPZ one $z=3/2$, was found to emerge in the tensionless limit for the interface and in the inviscid limit for the fluid. Based on functional renormalization group, the origin of this scaling has been elucidated. It was shown to be controlled by a yet unpredicted fixed point of the one-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation, termed inviscid Burgers (IB) fixed point. The associated universal properties, including the scaling function, were calculated. All these findings were restricted to $d=1$, and it raises the intriguing question of the fate of this new IB fixed point in higher dimensions. In this work, we address this issue and analyze the multi-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation using functional renormalization group. We show that the IB fixed point exists in all dimensions $d\geq 0$, and that it controls the large momentum behavior of the correlation functions in the inviscid limit. It turns out that it yields in all $d$ the same super-universal value $z=1$ for the dynamical exponent.</description>

      <title>Experimental confirmation of breach of the basic postulate of Statistical Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the course of computer modeling of the most probable stationary macrostates of non-ergodic closed systems, a forecast was obtained about the existence of limits of applicability of the basic axiomatic postulate of statistical physics, known as the Principle of Equiprobability of each realizable microstate. Moreover, for such systems, thermodynamic equilibrium is no longer the only permissible stationary state. The possibility of other most probable macrostates is predicted, which are characterized by the presence of a stable anisotropy of the polarization parameters of thermal radiation filling these systems. The article presents successful results of direct experimental verification of the above prognosis on a real physical installation. Important regularities inherent in the used mathematical model are noted.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Laplacian community detection in heterogeneous networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04514v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous and complex networks represent intertwined interactions between real-world elements or agents. Determining the multi-scale mesoscopic organization of clusters and intertwined structures is still a fundamental and open problem of complex network theory. By taking advantage of the recent Laplacian Renormalization Group, we scrutinize information diffusion pathways throughout networks to shed further light on this issue. Based on inter-node communicability, our definition provides a clear-cut framework for resolving the multi-scale mesh of structures in complex networks, disentangling their intrinsic arboreal architecture. As it does not consider any topological null-model assumption, the LRG naturally permits the introduction of scale-dependent optimal partitions. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a particular class of nodes, called 'metastable' nodes, that switching regions to which they belong at different scales, likely playing a pivotal role in cross-regional communication and, therefore, in managing macroscopic effects of the whole network.</description>

      <title>Proposal of a quantum version of active particles via a nonunitary quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of the present paper is to define an active particle in a quantum framework as a minimal model of quantum active matter and investigate the differences and similarities of quantum and classical active matter. Although the field of active matter has been expanding, most research has been conducted on classical systems. Here, we propose a truly deterministic quantum active-particle model with a nonunitary quantum walk as the minimal model of quantum active matter. We aim to reproduce results obtained previously with classical active Brownian particles; that is, a Brownian particle, with finite energy take-up, becomes active and climbs up a potential wall. We realize such a system with nonunitary quantum walks. We introduce new internal states, the ground state and the excited state, and a new nonunitary operator $N(g)$ for an asymmetric transition between the two states. The non-Hermiticity parameter $g$ promotes the transition to the excited state; hence, the particle takes up energy from the environment. For our quantum active particle, we successfully observe that the movement of the quantum walker becomes more active in a nontrivial manner as we increase the non-Hermiticity parameter $g$, which is similar to the classical active Brownian particle. We also observe three unique features of quantum walks, namely, ballistic propagation of peaks in one dimension, the walker staying on the constant energy plane in two dimensions, and oscillations originating from the resonant transition between the ground state and the excited state both in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuits based on the Quantum Natural Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient preparation of arbitrary entangled quantum states is crucial for quantum computation. This is particularly important for noisy intermediate scale quantum simulators relying on variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. To that end, we propose symmetry-conserving modified quantum approximate optimization algorithm~(SCom-QAOA) circuits. The depths of these circuits depend not only on the desired fidelity to the target state, but also on the amount of entanglement the state contains. The parameters of the SCom-QAOA circuits are optimized using the quantum natural gradient method based on the Fubini-Study metric. The SCom-QAOA circuit transforms an unentangled state into a ground state of a gapped one-dimensional Hamiltonian with a circuit-depth that depends not on the system-size, but rather on the finite correlation length. In contrast, the circuit depth grows proportionally to the system size for preparing low-lying states of critical one-dimensional systems. Even in the latter case, SCom-QAOA circuits with depth less than the system-size were sufficient to generate states with fidelity in excess of 99\%, which is relevant for near-term applications. The proposed scheme enlarges the set of the initial states accessible for variational quantum algorithms and widens the scope of investigation of non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Scalable molecular simulation of electrolyte solutions with quantum chemical accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrolyte solutions play critical role in a vast range of important applications, yet an accurate and scalable method of predicting their properties without fitting to experiment has remained out of reach, despite over a century of effort. Here, we combine state-of-the-art density functional theory and equivariant neural network potentials to demonstrate this capability, reproducing key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties. We show that neural network potentials (NNPs) can be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained/continuum-solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales than possible with all atom simulations. We observe the surprising formation of Li cation dimers along with identical anion-anion pairing of chloride and bromide anions. Finally, we reproduce simulate the crystal phase and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained only on moderate concentration solutions. This approach should be scaled to build a greatly expanded database of electrolyte solution properties than currently exists.</description>

      <title>HEOM-QUICK2: a general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body open quantum systems -- An Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body open quantum systems (OQS) have a profound impact on various subdisciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Thus, the development of a computer program capable of accurately, efficiently, and versatilely simulating many-body OQS is highly desirable. In recent years, we have focused on the advancement of numerical algorithms based on the fermionic hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) theory. Being in-principle exact, this approach allows for the precise characterization of many-body correlations, non-Markovian memory, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. These efforts now lead to the establishment of a new computer program, HEOM for QUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel, version 2 (HEOM-QUICK2), which, to the best of our knowledge, is currently the only general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body OQS. Compared with version 1, the HEOM-QUICK2 program features more efficient solvers for stationary states, more accurate treatment of non-Markovian memory, and improved numerical stability for long-time dissipative dynamics. Integrated with quantum chemistry software, HEOM-QUICK2 has become a valuable theoretical tool for the precise simulation of realistic many-body OQS, particularly the single atomic or molecular junctions. Furthermore, the unprecedented precision achieved by HEOM-QUICK2 enables accurate simulation of low-energy spin excitations and coherent spin relaxation. The unique usefulness of HEOM-QUICK2 is demonstrated through several examples of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems under non-equilibrium conditions. Thus, the new HEOM-QUICK2 program offers a powerful and comprehensive tool for studying many-body OQS with exotic quantum phenomena and exploring applications in various disciplines.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Occupational Mobility in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era of rapid technological advancements and macroeconomic shifts, worker reallocation is necessary, yet responses to labor market shocks remain sluggish, making it crucial to identify bottlenecks in occupational transitions to understand labor market dynamics and improve mobility. In this study, we analyze French occupational data to uncover patterns of worker mobility and pinpoint specific occupations that act as bottlenecks which impede rapid reallocation. We introduce two metrics, transferability and accessibility, to quantify the diversity of occupational transitions and find that bottlenecks can be explained by a condensation effect of occupations with high accessibility but low transferability. Transferability measures the variety of transitions from an occupation to others, while accessibility assesses the variety of transitions into an occupation. We provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing occupational complexity and mobility patterns, offering insights into potential barriers and pathways for efficient retraining programs. We argue that our approach can inform policymakers and stakeholders aiming to enhance labor market efficiency and support workforce adaptability.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>
