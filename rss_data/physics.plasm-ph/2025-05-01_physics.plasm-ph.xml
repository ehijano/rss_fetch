      <title>Evaluation and Verification of Physics-Informed Neural Models of the Grad-Shafranov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our contributions are motivated by fusion reactors that rely on maintaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium, where the balance between plasma pressure and confining magnetic fields is required for stable operation. In axisymmetric tokamak reactors in particular, and under the assumption of toroidal symmetry, this equilibrium can be mathematically modelled using the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the GSE. Existing studies did not examine realistic scenarios in which a single network generalizes to a variety of boundary conditions. Addressing that limitation, we evaluate a PINN architecture that incorporates boundary points as network inputs. Additionally, we compare PINN model accuracy and inference speeds with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model. Finding the PINN model to be the most performant, and accurate in our setting, we use the network verification tool Marabou to perform a range of verification tasks. Although we find some discrepancies between evaluations of the networks natively in PyTorch, compared to via Marabou, we are able to demonstrate useful and practical verification workflows. Our study is the first investigation of verification of such networks.</description>

      <title>Electron magnetization effects on carbonaceous dusty nanoparticles grown in $Ar/C_2H_2$ capacitively coupled nonthermal plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbonaceous dusty nanoparticles spontaneously grow in nonthermal plasmas from a gas mixture of argon and acetylene. These particles levitate and grow within the bulk plasma for a duration known as the growth cycle ($T_c$), after which they gradually move away. In experiments operating at 500 milliTorr, the particles reach a maximum radius of approximately 250 nm for $T_c \sim$ 121 s. However, the introduction of weak magnetic fields reduces both the maximum radius and $T_c$. The modified electron Hall parameter ($H_e'$), which quantifies the degree of electron magnetization, increases linearly with the magnetic field strength, transitioning from unmagnetized electrons ($H_e' &lt; 1$) to magnetized electrons ($H_e' &gt; 1$). $T_c$ gradually decreases to around 40 s until $H_e' \sim 1$ at approximately 330 Gauss, after which it remains roughly constant for fields up to about 1020 Gauss. Additionally, with increasing magnetic field strength, the dust growth rate initially decreases to $H_e' \sim 1$, then increases slightly again. These results demonstrate that the onset of electron magnetization at can control the growth of nanoparticles from chemical precursors in nonthermal plasmas, which is relevant for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Extended self-similarity in two-dimensional complex plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-similarity is a property of an object or process wherein a part is similar to the whole. Mathematically, it can often be expressed as a power-law scaling of the quantity of interest. Extended self-similarity is a concept widely used in the field of turbulence and refers to the power-law scaling of the longitudinal structure functions of the velocity field expressed through the structure functions of different orders, rather than distance. Originally discovered by [R. Benzi et al., Phys. Rev. E 48, R29 (1993)] in fully developed turbulence, it was later found to hold in other situations and systems as well. In this paper, we show that in an active-matter system, extended self-similarity is possible even without the presence of respective power-law scaling in the underlying structure functions of distance. The active-matter system used in this study was a single-layer suspension of active Janus particles in a plasma. Janus particles are polymer microspheres with hemispherical metal coating. When dispersed in a plasma, they acquire self-propulsion and act as microswimmers. Extended self-similarity was also observed in the velocity field of a single-layer suspension of laser-heated regular (passive) particles, where the underlying structure functions displayed a hint of the power-law scaling near the mean interparticle distance. Therefore, it appears to be an inherent characteristic of complex plasmas.</description>

      <title>No Evidence of Anomalous Diffusion in Yukawa Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion in Yukawa crystals is stochastic due to the thermally activated formation of vacancy-interstitial pairs, which have poor statistics in simulations. This makes it difficult to argue if Yukawa crystals exhibit normal diffusion, or if they could be subdiffusive or superdiffusive. To resolve this, we run a long molecular dynamics simulation of an idealized Yukawa crystal for a billion timesteps. We find no evidence of anomalous diffusion in the pure crystal, but also caution readers against overinterpreting this result as real crystals have complicated structures including grains and defects.</description>

      <title>The effect of neon seeding on plasma edge transport in EAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of neon seeding on different transport mechanisms in EAST is investigated by analyzing SOLPSITER simulations. By evaluating the agreement between experimental observations and the performed simulations, four simulations are selected for a detailed analysis. In this analysis, it is shown that the presence of neon reduces the influence of drifts on the simulated profiles. In the simulation results, double peaked profiles/profiles with two valleys are observed at the divertor targets which can be explained by the parallel drift velocities These drifts move particles from the outboard towards the inboard side and, in that way, also increase the ionization sources at the inboard side. It is shown that Ne+ leaks towards the core making it difficult to perform experiments which contain as much neon as in the SOLPS-ITER simulations. In fact, the level of neon in the experiments is limited by the HL backtransition which takes place if higher order states of neon ionize in the core and cause in that way too much core radiation. Furthermore, the analysis of the radiated power profiles suggests that the presence of other radiators besides neon is important to bring the experiments into detachment. The ionization of deuterium is the most important neutral reaction present in the simulations. The amount of ionized deuterium is decreased when large amounts of neon are present and the anomalous transport is modified. Therefore, it is concluded that for the analyzed simulations, neon increases the radiated power fraction, decreases the deuterium ionization, increases the neutral friction, but does not manage to cause significant influence of deuterium recombination. As a consequence, volumetric recombination only plays a minor role in the studied simulations.</description>

      <title>TRIMEG-GKX: an electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle code with a Piecewise Field-Aligned Finite Element Method for Micro- and Macro-Instability Studies in Tokamak Core Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The features of the TRIMEG-GKX code are described with emphasis on the exploration using novel/different schemes compared to other gyrokinetic codes, particularly the use of object-oriented programming, filter/buffer-free treatment, and a high-order piecewise field-aligned finite element method. The TRIMEG-GKX code solves the electromagnetic gyrokinetic equation using the particle-in-cell scheme, taking into account multi-species effects and shear Alfv\'en physics. The mixed-variable/pullback scheme has been implemented to enable electromagnetic studies. This code is parallelized using particle decomposition and domain cloning among computing nodes, replacing traditional domain decomposition techniques. The applications to study the micro- and macro-instabilities are demonstrated, including the energetic-particle-driven Alfv\'en eigenmode, ion temperature gradient mode, and kinetic ballooning mode. Good performance is achieved in both ad hoc and experimentally reconstructed equilibria, such as those of the ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), Tokamak \`a configuration variable (TCV), and the Joint European Torus (JET). Future studies of edge physics using the high-order $C^1$ finite element method for triangular meshes in the TRIMEG-C1 code will be built upon the same numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Coalescing MPI communication in 6D Vlasov simulations: solving ghost domains in Vlasiator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance computing is used for diverse simulations, some of which parallelize over the Message Passing Interface (MPI) with ease, whilst others may have challenges related to uniform balancing of computational load and communication between simulation domains. We introduce an alternative approach to solving advection equations, specifically in an application to solving the six-dimensional Vlasov equation for modelling space plasmas. Communicating larger ghost domains around the partition assigned to each MPI task and computing on these ghost cells allows for coalescing several discrete communication calls into one. This approach needs more overall data communication and computation, but provides interesting new avenues for the balancing of computational load between MPI tasks. We discuss this trade-off, how it may assist in developing other algorithmic improvements, and how the transition to heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures may impact its usefulness.</description>

      <title>Autoresonant Removal of Fusion Products in Mirror Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic confinement fusion reactors produce ash particles that must be removed for efficient operation. It is suggested to use autoresonance (a continuous phase-locking between anharmonic motion and a chirped drive) to remove the ash particles from a magnetic mirror, the simplest magnetic confinement configuration. An analogy to the driven pendulum is established via the guiding center approximation. The full 3D dynamics is simulated for $\alpha$ particles (the byproduct of DT fusion) in agreement with the approximated 1D model. Monte Carlo simulations sampling the phase space of initial conditions are used to quantify the efficiency of the method. The DT fuel particles are out of the bandwidth of the chirped drive and, therefore, stay in the mirror for ongoing fusion. The method is also applicable for advanced, aneutronic reactors, such as p-$^{11}$B.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Operating Regimes of Pulsed Plasma Accelerators for Efficient Propellant Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) acceleration modes in pulsed plasma thrusters has been verified using the magnetic extension of Rankine-Hugoniot theory. However, the impact of initial conditions within the accelerator volume on the formation and structure of these modes remains poorly understood. This work develops a regime map to clarify how key initial conditions - such as propellant gas dynamics, pulse energy, and the timing between propellant injection and discharge initiation - govern transitions between two distinct MHD operating modes, a magneto-detonation and magneto-deflagration, along with an unstable transition regime that connects them. To characterize these regimes, a combination of time-of-flight and thrust stand diagnostics was used to assess their properties, scalability, and structure while operating with air. Time-of-flight measurements reveal that reducing the initial downstream propellant mass ($m_{dwn}$) of air from 120 $\mu$g to 60 $\mu$g shifts the thruster from the magneto-detonation to the magneto-deflagration regime, increasing exhaust velocity ($v_{ex}$) from 20 km/s to 55 km/s. In this regime, the thruster exhibits improved propellant utilization as less mass is injected. At a constant 8 kA of peak current, specific impulse (Isp) increases from ~100-2000 s as $m_{dwn}$ decreases from 70 to 10 $\mu$g, corresponding to an increase in utilization efficiency ($\eta$util) from 5% to 35%. Thrust-to-power ratios, measured using a thrust stand, also improve with peak current in the magneto-deflagration regime, increasing from 4.5 mN/kW to 8 mN/kW and 6.7 mN/kW for injected mass bits of 25 $\mu$g and 50 $\mu$g, respectively. This work provides critical insights into how the initial conditions in pulsed plasma thrusters dictate the formation of ionization waves, structure of plumes, and the performance of thrusters.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theories in Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We briefly review the recent developments in magnetohydrodynamics, which in particular deal with the evolution of magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas. We especially emphasize (i) the necessity of renormalizing equations of motion in turbulence where velocity and magnetic fields become H\"older singular; (ii) the breakdown of Laplacian determinism (spontaneous stochasticity) for turbulent magnetic fields; and (iii) the possibility of eliminating the notion of magnetic field lines, using instead magnetic path lines as trajectories of Alfvenic wave-packets. These methodologies are then exemplified with their application to the problem of magnetic reconnection -- rapid change in magnetic field pattern that accelerates plasma -- a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics and laboratory plasmas. The necessity of smoothing out rough velocity and magnetic fields on a finite scale L implies that magnetohydrodynamic equations should be regarded as effective field theories with running parameters depending upon the scale L.</description>

      <title>An assessment of observational coverage and gaps for robust Sun to heliosphere integrated science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Model of Solar Wind Acceleration Driven by Ambipolar Electric Potential and Velocity-Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations have revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration has not yet been identified. We aim to provide a framework that incorporates the electric-field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via a velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric-field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii (Rs) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while leaving the electric potential unchanged. The approach described in this work enables the diffusion to be adjusted to effectively reduce or increase the solar wind acceleration. Even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.</description>
