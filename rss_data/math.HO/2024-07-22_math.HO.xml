      <title>History of confluent Vandermonde matrices and inverting them algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author was encouraged to write this review by numerous enquiries from researchers all over the world, who needed a ready-to-use algorithm for the inversion of confluent Vandermonde matrices which works in quadratic time for any values of the parameters allowed by the definition, including the case of large root multiplicities of the characteristic polynomial. Article gives the history of the title special matrix since 1891 and surveys algorithms for solving linear systems with the title class matrix and inverting it. In particular, it presents, also by example, a numerical algorithm which does not use symbolic computations and is ready to be implemented in a general-purpose programming language or in a specific mathematical package.</description>

      <title>An Elementary but Logical Approach to Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a replacement for traditional Riemann integrals in undergraduate calculus, which supplements naive precalculus and at the same time opens a way to more sophisticated theories such as Lebesgue integration.</description>

      <title>Fragments of a History of the Concept of Ideal. Poncelet's and Chasles's Reflections on Generality in Geometry and their Impact on Kummer's Work with Ideal Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this essay, I argue for the following theses. First, Kummer's concept of ''ideal prime factors of a complex number'' was inspired by Poncelet's introduction of ideal elements in geometry as well as by the reconceptualization that Michel Chasles put forward for them in 1837. In other words, the idea of ideal divisors in Kummer's ''theory of complex numbers'' derives from the introduction of ideal elements in the new geometry. This is where the term ''ideal'' comes from. Second, the introduction of ideal elements into geometry and the subsequent reconceptualization of what was in play with these elements were linked to philosophical reflections on generality that practitioners of geometry in France developed in the first half of the 19${}^{\rm th}$ century in order to devise a new approach to geometry, which would eventually become projective geometry. These philosophical reflections circulated as such and played a key part in the advance of other domains, including in Kummer's major innovation in the context of number theory.</description>

      <title>How Much String to String a Cardioid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A residue design is an artistic geometric construction in which we have $n$ equally-spaced points on a circle numbered 0 through $n-1$ and we join with a line segment each point $k$ to $ak$ modulo $n$ for some fixed $a\ge 2.$ The envelopes of these lines are epicycloids, like cardioids. In this article, we prove that the sum of the lengths of these line segments has a surprisingly simple closed form. In particular, if one wants to make one of these designs with string, it is easy to calculate how much string is required.</description>
