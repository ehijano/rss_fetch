      <title>Rectangle partitions generalizing integer partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a natural geometric extension of the partition function. More precisely, we investigate the problem of counting partitions of a rectangle into rectangular blocks with integer sides. Here, two partitions of a rectangle are indistinguishable if they consist of the same multiset of blocks -- their geometric arrangement does not matter.</description>

      <title>Scaled Arndt Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer compositions restricted by inequalities on certain pairs of parts were first considered by J\"{o}rg Arndt in 2013 and several variations have been studied recently. Here we consider a broad two-parameter generalization that scales the defining relation. We connect these to compositions restricted to parts from certain congruence classes and establish the recurrence relations satisfied by the related counting sequences. This provides new combinatorial interpretations to several documented integer sequences and also simple unrecorded sequences. We conclude with suggestions for further study.</description>

      <title>Composition Direction of Seymour's Theorem for Regular Matroids -- Formally Verified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seymour's decomposition theorem is a hallmark result in matroid theory presenting a structural characterization of the class of regular matroids. Formalization of matroid theory faces many challenges, most importantly that only a limited number of notions and results have been implemented so far. In this work, we formalize the proof of the forward (composition) direction of Seymour's theorem for regular matroids. To this end, we develop a library in Lean 4 that implements definitions and results about totally unimodular matrices, vector matroids, their standard representations, regular matroids, and 1-, 2-, and 3-sums of matrices and binary matroids given by their standard representations. Using this framework, we formally state Seymour's decomposition theorem and implement a formally verified proof of the composition direction in the setting where the matroids have finite rank and may have infinite ground sets.</description>

      <title>Judicious partitions for restricted self-sumsets in cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimax problem for restricted two-fold self-sumsets in $k$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. For primes $p$ with $2\le k\le p$ we determine the exact minimum $\max\{0,\,2\lceil p/k\rceil-3\}$. For general $n$ (with $m=\lceil n/k\rceil$) we bound the optimum between a size term $\min\{p(n),\,2m-3\}$ and a periodicity term $f\big(n/q(n,k)\big)$, and show these bounds are tight when $2m-3\le p(n)$ or $f\big(n/q(n,k)\big)\le \min\{p(n),\,2m-3\}$. We further prove a stability inequality and a threshold theorem that force concentration in a single subgroup coset near the periodic scale. In the prime case with $m\ge 5$ and $2m-3&lt;p$, every optimal coloring contains a class of size $m$ that is an arc (an arithmetic progression up to an affine automorphism). Our approach combines the restricted Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn phenomenon with block/coset colorings and an injectivity window.</description>

      <title>Burning games on strong path products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burning and cooling are diffusion processes on graphs in which burned (or cooled) vertices spread to their neighbors with a new source picked at discrete time steps. In burning, the one tries to burn the graph as fast as possible, while in cooling one wants to delay cooling as long as possible.
  We consider $d$-fold strong products of paths, which generalize king graphs. The propagation of these graphs is radial, and models local spread of contagion in an arbitrary number of dimensions. We reduce the problem to a geometric tiling problem to obtain a bound for the burning number of a strong product of paths by a novel use of an Euler-Maclaurin formula, which is sharp under certain number theoretic conditions.
  Additionally, we consider liminal burning, which is a two-player perfect knowledge game played on graphs related to the effectiveness of controlled spread of contagion throughout a network. We introduce and study the number $k^*$, the smallest $k$ such that $b_{k}(G) = b(G)$.</description>

      <title>The unavoidable drawings of complete multipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a simple drawing of a graph every pair of edges intersect each other in at most one point, which is either a common endvertex or a proper crossing. For each positive integer $n$, Negami identified a drawing $B_n$ of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, and proved that if $N$ is sufficiently large, then every drawing of $K_{N,N}$ contains a drawing of $K_{n,n}$ weakly isomorphic to $B_n$. Thus $B_n$ is (up to weak isomorphism) the only {\em unavoidable} drawing of $K_{n,n}$. We extend this result to complete multipartite graphs, characterizing their unavoidable drawings.</description>

      <title>On Pauling's residual entropy estimate for regular graphs with growing degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1935, Pauling proposed an estimate for the number of Eulerian orientations of a graph in the context of the theoretical behaviour of water ice. The logarithm of the number of Eulerian orientations, normalised by the number of vertices, is called the residual entropy. In an earlier paper, we conjectured that the residual entropy of a sequence of regular graphs of increasing degree was asymptotically equal to Pauling's estimate. Here we prove the conjecture under constraints on the number of short circuits. These constraints hold under weak eigenvalue conditions and apply to sequences of increasing girth and repeated Cartesian products such as hypercubes.</description>

      <title>$q$-Laplacian State Transfer on Graphs with Involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of state transfer with respect to the $q$-Laplacian matrix of a graph equipped with a non-trivial involution. We show that the occurrence of perfect state transfer between certain pair (or plus) states in such a graph is equivalent to the existence of vertex state transfer in a subgraph induced by the involution with potentials. This yields infinite families of trees with potentials and unicyclic graphs of maximum degree three that exhibit perfect pair state transfer. In particular, we investigate vertex and pair state transfer in edge-perturbed complete bipartite graphs, cycles, and paths with potentials only at the end vertices.</description>

      <title>The odd independence number of graphs, I: Foundations and classical classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An odd independent set $S$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an independent set of vertices such that, for every vertex $v \in V \setminus S$, either $N(v) \cap S = \emptyset$ or $|N(v) \cap S| \equiv 1$ (mod 2), where $N(v)$ stands for the open neighborhood of $v$. The largest cardinality of odd independent sets of a graph $G$, denoted $\alpha_{od}(G)$, is called the odd independence number of $G$.
  This new parameter is a natural companion to the recently introduced strong odd chromatic number. A proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is a strong odd coloring if, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, each color used in the neighborhood of $v$ appears an odd number of times in $N(v)$. The minimum number of colors in a strong odd coloring of $G$ is denoted by $\chi_{so}(G)$.
  A simple relation involving these two parameters and the order $|G|$ of $G$ is $\alpha_{od}(G)\cdot \chi_{so}(G) \geq |G|$, parallel to the same on chromatic number and independence number.
  We develop several basic inequalities concerning $\alpha_{od}(G)$, and use already existing results on strong odd coloring, to derive lower bounds for odd independence in many families of graphs.
  We prove that $\alpha_{od}(G) = \alpha(G^2)$ holds for all claw-free graphs $G$, and present many results, using various techniques, concerning the odd independence number of cycles, paths, Moore graphs, Kneser graphs, the complete subdivision $S(K_n)$ of $K_n$, the half graphs $H_{n,n}$, and $K_p \Box K_q$. Further, we consider the odd independence number of the hypercube $Q_d$ and also of the complements of triangle-free graphs. Many open problems for future research are stated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fatness of a 4-polytope or 3-sphere is defined as $(f_1+f_2-20)/(f_0+f_3-10)$. We construct arbitrarily fat, strongly regular CW 3-spheres that are both shellable and dual shellable. These spheres have $f$-vectors $(\Theta(n),\Theta(n\alpha(n)),\Theta(n\alpha(n)),\Theta(n))$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function.</description>

      <title>Mutually Abelian-Bordered Binary Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A word is said to be bordered if it contains a nonempty proper prefix that is also a suffix. A pair of words $(u, v)$ is said to be mutually bordered if there exists a word that is a nonempty proper prefix of $u$ and suffix of $v$, and there exists a word that is a nonempty proper suffix of $u$ and prefix of $v$. Recently, Gabric studied the number of mutually bordered pairs. In this work, we extend the concept of mutually bordered pairs to abelian setting, and determine the number of mutually abelian-bordered pairs of binary words using lattice paths. We also find the number of unbordered pairs in this context.</description>

      <title>A multiset approach to MacWilliams identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We interpret the symmetrized weight enumerator of linear codes over finite commutative Frobenius rings as a summation over multisets and thereby provide a new proof of the MacWilliams identity for the symmetrized weight enumerator. The proof and the identity are expressed in combinatorial terms that do not require generating characters. We also generalize the symmetrized weight enumerator with respect to supports and codeword tuples, and our multiset approach enables us to derive new and general MacWilliams identities expressed in combinatorial terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combinatorially prove a recurrence between the Tutte polynomials of graphs obtained by contraction of the complete graphs $K_{n}$%. This generalizes to two variables a relation previously obtained by the author between the inversion enumerating polynomials in the colored trees. A combinatorial interpretation concerning certain polynomials recently introduced by the author via the theory of symmetric functions is also conjectured . This intrepretation uses the depth-first search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, despite the Poincar\'e polynomial of $F_4$ is a product of $q$-analogues, the Bruhat order of $F_4$ does not admit a product of chains as subposet. This answers negatively, in this type, a question by Billey, Fan and Losonczy. In other words, we show that Lehmer codes for type $F_4$ do not exist. Nevertheless, by introducing weak Lehmer codes, we construct explicitly multicomplexes and Lehmer complexes for any lower Bruhat interval in type $F_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that every graph with $m$ edges admits a 3-partition such that \[ \max_{1 \leq i \leq 3} e(V_i) \leq \frac{m}{9} + \frac{1}{9}h(m) \quad \text{and} \quad e(V_1, V_2, V_3) \geq \frac{2}{3}m + \frac{1}{3}h(m), \] where $h(m) = \sqrt{2m + 1/4} - 1/2$. This answers a problem of Bollob\'as and Scott affirmatively. We also solve several related problems of Bollob\'as and Scott. All of our results are tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph on $n \ge 3$ vertices drawn in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most four times has at most $6(n-2)$ edges -- this result proven by Ackerman is outstanding in the literature of beyond-planar graphs with regard to its tightness and the structural complexity of the graph class. We provide a much shorter proof while at the same time relaxing the conditions on the graph and its embedding, i.e., allowing multi-edges and non-simple drawings.</description>

      <title>Very Generalized LYM Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LYM inequality is a fundamental result concerning the sizes of subsets in a Sperner family. Subsequent studies on the LYM inequality have been generalized to families of $r$-decompositions, where all components are required to avoid chains of the same length. In this paper, we relax this constraint by allowing components of a family of $r$-decompositions to avoid chains of distinct lengths, and derive generalized LYM inequalities across all the relevant settings, including set-theoretic, $q$-analog, continuous analog, and arithmetic analog frameworks. Notably, the bound in our LYM inequalities does not depend on the maximal length of all forbidden chains. Moreover, we extend our approach beyond $r$-decompositions to $r$-multichains, and establish analogous LYM inequalities.</description>

Abstract: Maxout polytopes are defined by feedforward neural networks with maxout activation function and non-negative weights after the first layer. We characterize the parameter spaces and extremal f-vectors of maxout polytopes for shallow networks, and we study the separating hypersurfaces which arise when a layer is added to the network. We also show that maxout polytopes are cubical for generic networks without bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Bigraded Polynomials for the Cohomology of Wild Hitchin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bi-graded polynomial that encodes the cohomology groups of the wild Hitchin system of type~$A_{n-1}$, constructed using an irregular singularity (determined by an integer~$m$) and an arbitrary regular singularity~$f$. When the regular singularity is of the form~$f = [1, \ldots, 1]$, the bi-graded polynomial~$C_{m,n}(q,t)$ coincides with the bigraded rational parking function defined combinatorially, admitting a Schur expansion~$C_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) s_\lambda(x)$. For general~$f$, the polynomial takes the form~$C^f_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) K_{\lambda f}$, where~$K_{\lambda f}$ denotes the Kostka number. We conjecture that this bi-graded polynomial agrees with the one arising from the perverse filtration of the Hitchin fibration, or equivalently, from the weight filtration of the mixed Hodge structure from the character variety. We also give a description by using the geometry of affine Springer fiber.}</description>

      <title>Toric surface codes and the periodicity of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toric codes are error-correcting codes that are derived from toric varieties, which hold a unique correspondence to integral convex polytopes. In this paper, we focus on integral convex polytopes $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ and the toric codes they define. We begin by studying period-1 polytopes -- polytopes satisfying the property $L(tP)$ = $tL(P)$ for all $t \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, where $tP$ is the $t$-dilate of $P$, and we prove an explicit formula for the minimum distance of toric codes associated to a particular class of period-1 polytopes. We also apply the methods of Little and Schwarz, using Vandermonde matrices, to compute the minimum distance of another class of period-1 polytopes.</description>

Abstract: We study the distribution of partition parts in arithmetic progressions and find asymptotic results that capture all exponentially growing terms. This is accomplished by studying the behavior of non-modular Eisenstein series that appear in their generating function and have expressions in terms of indefinite and false-indefinite theta functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Bailey pairs to prove $q$-series identities at roots of unity due to Cohen and Bryson-Ono-Pitman-Rhoades. The proofs use Bailey pairs with quadratic forms developed in the study of mock theta functions. In addition to the standard Bailey lemma, we require some changes-of-base established by Bressoud-Ismail-Stanton. We then embed the identities in infinite families using the Bailey chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ehrhart theory is the study of the enumeration of lattice points in lattice polytopes. Equivariant Ehrhart theory is a generalization of Ehrhart theory that takes into account the action of a finite group acting via affine transformations on the underlying lattice and preserving the polytope. We further develop equivariant Ehrhart theory in part by establishing connections with commutative algebra as well as the question of when there exists an invariant lattice triangulation of a lattice polytope.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to Hildebrand's conjecture on stable sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a counterexample to a conjecture of Hildebrand which states that if $\S$ has positive lower density and is stable i.e. for all $d$, $n$ is in $\mathcal{S}$ if and only if $dn$ is in $\mathcal{S}$ except on a set of density $0$ then $\mathcal{S} \cap (\mathcal{S}+1) \cap (\mathcal{S}+2)$ has positive lower density and in particular is nonempty. We further show there exists a stable set of density $1 -\frac{1}{q-1}$ such that $\mathcal{S} \cap \cdots \cap (\mathcal{S} + q -1) = \emptyset$ when $q$ is a prime, matching a bound proven by Hildebrand. Finally, we construct a function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}$ such that $f(pn) = -f(n)$ for all but a $0$ density set of $n$ depending on the prime $p$ but which fails the analogues of Sarnak and Chowla's conjectures.</description>

      <title>Connectedness in weighted consensus division of graphical cakes between two agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Austin's moving knife procedure was originally introduced to find a consensus division of an interval/circular cake between two agents, each of whom believes that they receive exactly half of the cake. We generalise this in two ways: we consider cakes modelled by graphs, and let the two agents have unequal, arbitrary entitlements. In this setting, we seek a weighted consensus division -- one where each agent believes they received exactly the share they are entitled to -- which also minimises the number of connected components that each agent receives. First, we review the weighted consensus division of a circular cake, which gives exactly one connected piece to each agent. Next, by judiciously mapping a circle to a graph, we produce a weighted consensus division of a star graph cake that gives at most two connected pieces to each agent -- and show that this bound on the number of connected pieces is tight. For a tree, each agent receives at most h+1 connected pieces, where h is the minimal height of the tree. For a connected graphical cake, each agent receives r+2 connected pieces, where r is the radius of the graph. Finally, for a graphical cake with s connected components, the division involves at most s+2r+4 connected pieces, where r is the maximum radius among all connected components.</description>

Abstract: The Schubert problem asks for combinatorial models to compute structure constants of the cohomology ring with respect to Schubert classes and has been an important open problem in algebraic geometry and combinatorics that guided fruitful research for decades. In this paper, we provide an explicit formula for the (equivariant) Schubert structure constants $c_{uv}^w$ across all Lie types when the elements $u,v,w$ are boolean. In particular, in type $A$, all Schubert structure constants on boolean elements are either $0$ or $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices of $G$ is a \textit{dominating set} of $G$ if every vertex in $V(G)-S$ has a neighbor in $S$. The \textit{domination number} \(\gamma(G)\) is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of $G$. A dominating set $S$ is a \textit{total dominating set} if $N(S)$=$V$ where $N(S)$ is the neighbor of $S$. The \textit{total domination number} \(\gamma_t(G)\) equals the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set of $G$. A set $D$ is an \textit{isolate set} if the induced subgragh $G[D]$ has at least one isolated vertex. The \textit{isolate number} \(i_0(G)\) is the minimum cardinality of a maximal isolate set. In this paper we study these parameters and answer open problems proposed by Hamid et al. in 2016.</description>

Abstract: To find crystals of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ representations of the form $\Lambda^n\text{Sym}^r\mathbb{C}^2$ it suffices to solve the combinatorial problem of decomposing Young's lattice into symmetric, saturated chains. We review the literature on this latter problem, and present a strategy to solve it. For $n \le 4$, the strategy recovers recently discovered solutions. We obtain (i) counting formulas for plethystic coefficients, (ii) new recursive formulas for plethysms of Schur functions, and (iii) formulas for the number of constituents of $\Lambda^n\text{Sym}^r\mathbb{C}^2$.</description>

      <title>Shameful Inequalities for List and DP Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic polynomial of a graph is an important notion in algebraic combinatorics that was introduced by Birkhoff in 1912; denoted $P(G,k)$, it equals the number of proper $k$-colorings of graph $G$. Enumerative analogues of the chromatic polynomial of a graph have been introduced for two well-studied generalizations of ordinary coloring, namely, list colorings: $P_{\ell}$, the list color function (1990); and DP colorings: $P_{DP}$, the DP color function (2019), and $P^*_{DP}$, the dual DP color function (2021). For any graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $P_{DP}(G, k) \leq P_\ell(G,k) \leq P(G,k) \leq P_{DP}^*(G,k)$. In 2000, Dong settled a conjecture of Bartels and Welsh from 1995 known as the Shameful Conjecture by proving that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, $P(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying $k \geq n-1$. In contrast, for infinitely many positive integers $n$, Seymour (1997) gave an example of an $n$-vertex graph for which the above inequality does not hold for some $k = \Theta(n/ \log n)$. In this paper, we consider analogues of Dong's result for list and DP color functions. Specifically, in contrast to the chromatic polynomial, we prove that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, $P_{\ell}(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{\ell}(G,k)/k^n$ and $P_{DP}(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{DP}(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For the dual DP analogue of these inequalities, we show that there is a graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P_{DP}^*(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n &lt; P_{DP}^*(G,k)/k^n$, and we prove $P_{DP}^*(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{DP}^*(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying $k \geq n-1$ when $G$ is an $n$-vertex complete bipartite graph.</description>

Abstract: We study an alternating sum involving factorials and Stirling numbers of the first kind. We give an exponential generating function for these numbers and show they are nonnegative and enumerate the number of increasing trees on $n$ vertices that are won by the second of two players when interpreted as a game tree. We also give a simple description of the quotient from the weak order to the Tamari lattice in terms of plane trees, and give bijections between plane trees, 213-avoiding permutations, and 312-avoiding permutations. Finally, for a rooted tree, we give equivalent characterizations of when it describes a game won by the first or second player in terms of the rank-generating function of the lattice of prunings and the Euler characteristic of an associated real variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{n,a}$ be the set consisting of involutions in symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ with exactly $a$ fixed points and apply the orbit harmonics method to obtain a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Liu, Ma, Rhoades, and Zhu figured out a signed combinatorial formula for the graded Frobenius image $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Our goal is to cancel these signs. Finally, we find two positive combinatorial formulae for $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$, yielding potential ways to find a linear basis for $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$ and find a statistic $\mathrm{stat}:\mathcal{M}_{n,a}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ to interpret the Hilbert series $\mathrm{Hilb}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$.</description>

      <title>On the Squared Distance Matrix of a Starlike Block Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D(G)$ be the distance matrix of a simple connected graph $G$. The Hadamard product $D(G)~\circ~ D(G)$ is called the squared distance matrix of $G$, and is denoted by $\Delta(G)$. A simple connected graph is called a starlike block graph if it has a central cut vertex, and each of its blocks is a complete graph. Let $ \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b)$ be the starlike block graph with blocks $K_{n_1+1}, K_{n_2+1}, \ldots, K_{n_b+1} $ on $n=1 + \sum_{i=1}^b n_i$ vertices. In this article, we compute the determinant of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$ and find its inverse as a rank-one perturbation of a positive semidefinite Laplacian-like matrix $\mathcal{L}$ with rank $n-1$. We also investigate the inertia of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$. Furthermore, for a fixed value of $ n $ and $ b $, we determine the extremal graphs that uniquely attain the maximum and minimum spectral radius of the squared distance matrix for starlike block graphs on $ n $ vertices and $ b $ blocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a short proof of a conic version of the colorful Carath\'eodory theorem for oriented matroids. Holmsen's extension of the colorful Carath\'eodory theorem to oriented matroids (Advances in Mathematics, 2016) already encompasses several generalizations of the original result, but not its conic version. Our approach relies on a common generalization of Sperner's lemma and Meshulam's lemma-two closely related results from combinatorial topology that have found a number of applications in discrete geometry and combinatorics. This generalization may be of independent interest.
  Using a similar approach, we also establish the following colorful theorem for topes, whose special geometric case had not been considered before: Given $n$ topes from a uniform oriented matroid with $n$ elements, if they agree on some element, then there is a way to select a distinct element from each tope, together with its sign, so as to form another tope of the oriented matroid. Motivated by this theorem, we further explore other conditions leading to the same conclusion.</description>

      <title>To cover a permutohedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The permutohedron $P_n$ of order $n$ is a polytope embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose vertex coordinates are permutations of the first $n$ natural numbers. It is obvious that $P_n$ lies on the hyperplane $H_n$ consisting of points whose coordinates sum up to $n(n+1)/2$. We prove that if the vertices of $P_n$ are contained in the union of $m$ affine hyperplanes different from $H_n$, then $m\geq n$ when $n \geq 3$ is odd, and $m \geq n-1$ when $n \geq 4$ is even. This confirms a recent conjecture of Heged\"us and K\'arolyi. Our proof gives an algebraic criterion for a non-standard permutohedron generated by $n$ distinct real numbers to require at least $n$ non-trivial hyperplanes to cover its vertices.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a constant $C&gt;0$ such that for each integer $n\geq 1$, there is a poset on at most $2^{2n/3+C\sqrt{n}}$ elements that contains each $n$-element poset as an (induced) subposet.</description>

      <title>Cluster deletion and clique partitioning in graphs with bounded clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cluster Deletion problem takes a graph $G$ as input and asks for a minimum size set of edges $X$ such that $G-X$ is the disjoint union of complete graphs. An equivalent formulation is the Clique Partition problem, which asks to find a partition of $V(G)$ into cliques such that the number of edges in the cliques is maximized.
  We begin by giving a much simpler proof of a theorem of Gao, Hare, and Nastos that Cluster Deletion is efficiently solvable on the class of cographs. We then investigate Cluster Deletion and Clique Partition on permutation graphs, which are a superclass of cographs. Our findings suggest that Cluster Deletion may be NP-hard on permutation graphs.
  Finally, we prove that for graphs with clique number at most $c$, there is a $\frac{2\binom{c}{2}}{\binom{c}{2}+1}$-approximation algorithm for Clique Partition. This is the first polynomial time algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio better than 2 for graphs with bounded clique number. More generally, our algorithm runs in polynomial time on any graph class for which Maximum Clique can be computed in polynomial time. We also provide a class of examples which shows that our approximation ratio is best possible.</description>

      <title>Families of tractable problems with respect to vertex-interval-membership width and its generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are graphs whose edges are labelled with times at which they are active. Their time-sensitivity provides a useful model of real networks, but renders many problems studied on temporal graphs more computationally complex than their static counterparts. To contend with this, there has been recent work devising parameters for which temporal problems become tractable. One such parameter is vertex-interval-membership (VIM) width. Broadly, this gives a bound on the number of vertices we need to keep track of at any given time to solve many problems. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new parameter, tree-interval-membership (TIM) width, that generalises both VIM width and several existing generalisations. Secondly, we provide meta-algorithms for both VIM and TIM width which can be used to prove fixed-parameter-tractability for large families of problems, bypassing the need to give involved dynamic programming arguments for every problem. In doing this, we provide a characterisation of problems in FPT with respect to both parameters. We apply these algorithms to temporal versions of Hamiltonian path, dominating set, matching, and edge deletion to limit maximum reachability.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.</description>

      <title>Barvinok's interpolation method meets Weitz's correlation decay approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we take inspiration from Weit'z algorithm for approximating the independence polynomial to provide a new algorithm for computing the coefficients of the Taylor series of the logarithm of the independence polynomial. Hereby we provide a clear connections between Barvinok's interpolation method and Weitz's algorithm. Our algorithm easily extends to other graph polynomials and partition functions and we illustrate this by applying it to the chromatic polynomial and to the graph homomorphism partition function. Our approach arguably yields a simpler and more transparent algorithm than the algorithm of Patel and the second author.
  As an application of our algorithmic approach we moreover derive, using the interpolation method, a deterministic $O(n(m/\varepsilon)^{7})$-time algorithm that on input of an $n$-vertex and $m$-edge graph of minimum degree at least $3$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ approximately computes the number of sink-free orientations of $G$ up to a multiplicative $\exp(\varepsilon)$ factor.</description>
