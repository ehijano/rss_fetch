      <title>Normal bundles of rational curves in Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In projective space over fields of characteristic different from 2, the normal bundle of a general nondegenerate rational curve is balanced. The corresponding statement for rational curves in other Grassmannians can fail. Nevertheless, we prove that the normal bundle of a general rational curve in a Grassmannian decomposes into a direct sum of line bundles whose degrees are at most 2 apart.</description>

      <title>Algebraic formulas and Geometric derivation of Source Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source identities are fundamental identities between multivariable special functions. We give a geometric derivation of rational and trigonometric source identities. We also give a systematic derivation and extension of various determinant representations for source functions which appeared in previous literature as well as introducing the elliptic version of the determinants, and obtain identities between determinants. We also show several symmetrization formulas for the rational version.</description>

      <title>On the dependence of the affine Springer fibers on their root valuation datum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the group $\mathrm{GL}_{d}$, we confirm a conjecture of Goresky, Kottwitz and MacPherson, which states that the cohomology of the affine Springer fibers depend only on the root valuation datum of their defining elements. The proof relies on a microlocal analysis of the intermediate extensions appearing in Ng\^o's support theorem, and a Whitney regularity property of the union of the strict $\delta$-strata over the equisingular strata for the miniversal deformation of plane curve singularities.</description>

      <title>A decomposition theorem for the affine Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Laumon, an affine Springer fiber is homeomorphic to the universal abelian covering of the compactified Jacobian of a spectral curve. We construct equivariant deformations $f_{n}:\overline{\mathcal{P}}_{n}\to \mathcal{B}_{n}$ of the finite abelian coverings of this compactified Jacobian, and decompose the complex $Rf_{n,*}\mathbf{Q}_{\ell}$ as direct sum of intersection complexes. Pass to the limit, we obtain a similar expression for the homology of the affine Springer fibers. A quite surprising consequence is that we can reduce the homology to its $\Lambda^{0}$-invariant subspace. As an application, we get a sheaf-theoretic reformulation of the purity hypothesis of Goresky, Kottwitz and MacPherson. In an attempt to solve it, we propose a conjecture about the punctural weight of the intermediate extension of a smooth $\ell$-adic sheaf of pure weight.</description>

      <title>Compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristics of symmetric powers of cellular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic, introduced by Hoyois and later refined by Levine and others, is an anologue in motivic homotopy theory of the classical Euler characteristic of complex topological manifolds. It is an invariant on the Grothendieck ring of varieties $\mathrm{K}_0(\mathrm{Var}_k)$ taking values in the Grothendieck-Witt ring $\mathrm{GW}(k)$ of the base field $k$. The former ring has a natural power structure induced by symmetric powers of varieties. In a recent preprint, Pajwani and P\'al construct a power structure on $\mathrm{GW}(k)$ and show that the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic respects these two power structures for $0$-dimensional varieties, or equivalently \'etale $k$-algebras. In this paper, we define the class $\mathrm{Sym}_k$ of symmetrisable varieties to be those varieties for which the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic respects the power structures and study the algebraic properties of $\mathrm{K}_0(\mathrm{Sym}_k)$. We show that it includes all cellular varieties, and even linear varieties as introduced by Totaro. Moreover, we show that it includes non-linear varieties such as elliptic curves. As an application of our main result, we compute the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristics of symmetric powers of Grassmannians and certain del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

Abstract: This introductory work combines bottom-up and top-down approaches towards understanding the underlying categorical structure of possible unifying theories descending from string theory. Guided by well-established developments in the realm of categorical algebraic geometry, we explain why abelianisation could potentially lead to furthering the understanding of how to embed Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in supersymmetric setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the tropicalization of the space of symmetric rank two matrices. Analogously to the result of Markwig and Yu for general tropical rank two matrices, we show that it has a simplicial complex structure as the space of symmetric bicolored trees and that this simplicial complex is shellable. We also discuss some matroid structures arising from this space and present generating functions for the number of symmetric bicolored trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some codes of algebraic geometry related to certain maximal curves. Quantum stabilizer codes obtained through the self orthogonality of Hermitian codes of this error correcting do not always have good parameters. However, appropriate parameters found that the Hermitian self-orthogonal code quantum stabilizer code has good parameters. Therefore, we investigated the quantum stabilizer code at a certain maximum curve and modified its parameters. Algebraic geometry codes show promise for enabling high data rate transmission over noisy power line communication channels.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a formula for $a$-number of certain maximal curves characterized by the equation $y^{\frac{q+1}{2}} = x^m + x$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. $a$-number serves as an invariant for the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion group scheme. Utilizing the action of the Cartier operator on $H^0(\mathcal{X}, \Omega^1)$, we establish a closed formula for $a$-number of $\mathcal{X}$.</description>

Abstract: We describe symplectic mapping class relations between products of positive Dehn twists along Lagrangian spheres in Weinstein $4$-manifolds, all of which are affine $\mathbb{C}$ varieties. The relations are obtained by applying classification results for Fano $3$-folds and polarized $K_{3}$ surfaces of small genus to a general methodology -- finding pencil pairs.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties that split modulo all but finitely many primes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a simple abelian variety over a number field $k$ such that $\operatorname{End}(A)$ is noncommutative. We show that $A$ splits modulo all but finitely many primes of $k$. We prove this by considering the subalgebras of $\operatorname{End}(A_{\mathfrak p})\otimes\mathbb{Q}$ which have prime Schur index. Our main tools are Tate's characterization of endomorphism algebras of abelian varieties over finite fields, and a Theorem of Chia-Fu Yu on embeddings of simple algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.03466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a formula for structure constants of certain variant form of Bott-Samelson classes for equivariant oriented cohomology of flag varieties. Specializing to singular cohomology/K-theory, we recover formulas of structure constants of Schubert classes of Goldin-Knutson, and that of structure constants of Segre-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of Su. We also obtain a formula for K-theoretic stable basis. Our method comes from the study of formal affine Demazure algebra, so is purely algebraic, while the above mentioned results are geometric.</description>

      <title>On the local behavior of weighted orbital integrals and the affine Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with two problems that seem to be of different nature: the local behavior of the weighted orbital integrals and the dependence of the affine Springer fibers on the root valuation datum of their defining elements. The intersection happens when we try to count the number of points on the fundamental domains of the affine Springer fibers: the number of points can be expressed in terms of certain weighted orbital integrals and vice versa.
  For the first problem, we prove the homogeneity of the Arthur-Shalika germ expansion of the weighted orbital integrals, and establish its parabolic descent. This is then applied to our conjecture about the dependence of the Poincar\'e polynomials of the fundamental domains on the root valuation datum. We show that the generating series of the number of points on the fundamental domains with respect to the root valuation datum of the defining elements is a rational fraction.</description>

      <title>Fourier transforms of irregular holonomic D-modules, singularities at infinity of meromorphic functions and irregular characteristic cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the recent developments in the irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for holonomic D-modules and the Fourier-Sato transforms for enhanced ind-sheaves, we study the Fourier transforms of some irregular holonomic D-modules. For this purpose, the singularities of rational and meromorphic functions on complex affine varieties will be studied precisely, with the help of some new methods and tools such as meromorphic vanishing cycle functors. As a consequence, we show that the exponential factors and the irregularities of the Fourier transform of a holonomic D-module are described geometrically by the stationary phase method, as in the classical case of dimension one. A new feature in the higher-dimensional case is that we have some extra rank jump of the Fourier transform produced by the singularities of the linear perturbations of the exponential factors at their points of indeterminacy. In the course of our study, not necessarily homogeneous Lagrangian cycles that we call irregular characteristic cycles will play a crucial role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we propose the generalization of the notion of a holomorphic contact structure on a manifold (smooth variety) to varieties with rational singularities and prove basic properties of such objects. Natural examples of singular contact varieties come from the theory of nilpotent orbits: every projectivization of the closure of a nilpotent orbit in a semisimple Lie algebra satisfies our definition after normalization. We show the correspondence between symplectic varieties with the structure of a $\mathbb{C}^*$-bundle and the contact ones along with the existence of the stratification \`a la Kaledin. In the projective case we demonstrate the equivalence between crepant and contact resolutions of singularities, show the uniruledness and give a full classification of projective contact varieties in dimension 3.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of a gap around zero for canonical height functions associated to endomorphisms of projective spaces defined over complex function fields. We also prove that if the rational points of height zero are Zariski dense, then the endomorphism is birationally isotrivial. As a corollary, by a result of S. Cantat and J. Xie, we have a geometric Northcott property on projective plane in the same spirit of results of R. Benedetto, M. Baker and L. Demarco on the projective line.</description>

Abstract: We give a treatment of relative Calabi--Yau structures on functors between $R$-linear stable $\infty$-categories, with $R$ any $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring spectrum, generalizing previous treatments in the setting of dg-categories. Using their gluing properties, we further construct relative Calabi--Yau structures on the global sections of perverse schobers, i.e. categorified perverse sheaves, on surfaces with boundary. We treat examples related to Fukaya categories and representation theory. In a related direction, we define the monodromy of a perverse schober parametrized by a ribbon graph on a framed surface and show that it forms a local system of stable $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>On A Tautological Relation Conjectured By Buryak-Shadrin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Buryak and Shadrin conjectured a tautological relation on moduli spaces of curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ which has the form $B^m_{g, \textbf{d}}=0$ for certain tautological classes $B^m_{g, \textbf{d}}$ where $m \geq 2, n \geq 1$ and $|\textbf{d}| \geq 2g+m-1$. In this paper we prove that this conjecture holds if it is true for the $m=2$ and $|\textbf{d}| = 2g+1$ case. This result reduces the proof of this conjecture to checking finitely many cases for each genus $g$. We will also prove this conjecture for the $g=1$ case.</description>

Abstract: Using the properties of the ideal of the coordinate Hermite interpolation on n-dimensional grid [4], we prove that the extension k in k[x1, x2, ..., xn] / (f1(x1), ..., fn(xn)) has a primitive element if and only if at most one of the univariate polynomials f1, ..., fn is inseparable. This result lead to some Corollaries related to the existence of primitive element of finite k-algebras. Finally, these results are further used to investigate the well known Frobenius question, whether two commuting matrices A and B can be expressed as polynomials in some matrix C. More specifically, we identify certain classes of matrices for which matrix C exists and different classes where no such matrix C exists.</description>

      <title>Hurwitz moduli varieties parameterizing pointed covers of an algebraic curve with a fixed monodromy group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth, projective curve $Y$, a point $y_0 \in Y$, a positive integer $n$, and a transitive subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_{d}$ we study smooth, proper families, parameterized by algebraic varieties, of pointed degree $d$ covers of $(Y,y_0)$, $(X,x_{0})\to (Y,y_0)$, branched in $n$ points of $Y\setminus y_{0}$, whose monodromy group equals $G$. We construct a Hurwitz space $H$, an algebraic variety whose points are in bijective correspondence with the equivalence classes of pointed covers of $(Y,y_0)$ of this type. We construct explicitly a family parameterized by $H$, whose fibers belong to the corresponding equivalence classes, and prove that it is universal. We use classical tools of algebraic topology and of complex algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Gysin sequences for regular immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a regular immersion of schemes $Z\to X$ and a cohomology theory of fs log schemes, we formulate the logarithmic Gysin sequence using the "logarithmic compactification" $(\mathrm{Bl}_Z X,E)$ instead of the open complement $X-Z$, where $E$ is the exceptional divisor. We show that all $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant cohomology theories produced from motivic spectra and various non $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant cohomology theories like Nygaard completed prismatic cohomology admit logarithmic Gysin sequences.</description>

      <title>Transforming Radical Differential Equations to Algebraic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithmic procedure that transforms, if possible, a given system of ordinary or partial differential equations with radical dependencies in the unknown function and its derivatives into a system with polynomial relations among them by means of a rational change of variables. The solutions of the given equation and its transformation correspond one-to-one. This work can be seen as a generalization of previous work on reparametrization of ODEs and PDEs with radical coefficients.</description>

      <title>General multiple Dirichlet series from perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an axiomatic characterization of multiple Dirichlet series over the function field $\mathbb F_q(T)$, generalizing a set of axioms given by Diaconu and Pasol. The key axiom, relating the coefficients at prime powers to sums of the coefficients, formalizes an observation of Chinta. The existence of multiple Dirichlet series satisfying these axioms is proved by exhibiting the coefficients as trace functions of explicit perverse sheaves and using properties of perverse sheaves. The multiple Dirichlet series defined this way include, as special cases, many that have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, and polynomials IV: linear-length reductions and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, algebras, and polynomials were recently shown to be equivalent to one another under polynomial-time reductions, prompting the introduction of the complexity class TI (Grochow &amp; Qiao, ITCS '21; SIAM J. Comp., '23). Using the tensorial viewpoint, Grochow &amp; Qiao (CCC '21) then gave moderately exponential-time search- and counting-to-decision reductions for a class of $p$-groups. A significant issue was that the reductions usually incurred a quadratic increase in the length of the tensors involved. When the tensors represent $p$-groups, this corresponds to an increase in the order of the group of the form $|G|^{\Theta(\log |G|)}$, negating any asymptotic gains in the Cayley table model.
  In this paper, we present a new kind of tensor gadget that allows us to replace those quadratic-length reductions with linear-length ones, yielding the following consequences:
  1. If Graph Isomorphism is in P, then testing equivalence of cubic forms in $n$ variables over $F_q$, and testing isomorphism of $n$-dimensional algebras over $F_q$, can both be solved in time $q^{O(n)}$, improving from the brute-force upper bound $q^{O(n^2)}$ for both of these.
  2. Combined with the $|G|^{O((\log |G|)^{5/6})}$-time isomorphism-test for $p$-groups of class 2 and exponent $p$ (Sun, STOC '23), our reductions extend this runtime to $p$-groups of class $c$ and exponent $p$ where $c&lt;p$, and yield algorithms in time $q^{O(n^{1.8}\cdot \log q)}$ for cubic form equivalence and algebra isomorphism.
  3. Polynomial-time search- and counting-to-decision reduction for testing isomorphism of $p$-groups of class $2$ and exponent $p$ when Cayley tables are given. This answers questions of Arvind and T\'oran (Bull. EATCS, 2005) for this group class, thought to be one of the hardest cases of Group Isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of Isogeny Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider finite graphs whose vertexes are supersingular elliptic curves, possibly with level structure, and edges are isogenies. They can be applied to the study of modular forms and to isogeny based cryptography. The main result of this paper says that these graphs have the Ramanujan property, which means that the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices are as small as possible. We also study the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices, the number of connected components, the automorphisms of the graphs, and the connection between the graphs and modular forms.</description>

      <title>Minimal hyperbolic polynomials and ranks of homogeneous cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The starting point of this paper is the computation of minimal hyperbolic polynomials of duals of cones arising from chordal sparsity patterns. From that, we investigate the relation between ranks of homogeneous cones and their minimal polynomials. Along the way, we answer in the negative a question posed in an earlier paper and show examples of homogeneous cones that cannot be realized as rank-one generated (ROG) hyperbolicity cones.</description>
