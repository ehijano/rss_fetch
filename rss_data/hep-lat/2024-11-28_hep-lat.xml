      <title>Systematic effects in the lattice calculation of inclusive semileptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the calculation of the inclusive semileptonic decay of the $D_s$ meson on the lattice. We simulate the $D_s \rightarrow X_s\ell\nu_\ell$ process with M\"obius domain-wall charm and strange quarks, whose masses are approximately tuned to their physical values. Our simulations cover the whole kinematical region. The focus of this work is to present updates on our strategies towards estimating the systematic uncertainties in the determination of the inclusive decay rate. We specifically focus on the systematic errors due to the choice of our approximation strategy and finite-volume effects.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Estimation on the Trace of Inverse Dirac Operator using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our preliminary results on the machine learning estimation of $\text{Tr} \, M^{-n}$ from other observables with the gradient boosting decision tree regression, where $M$ is the Dirac operator. Ordinarily, $\text{Tr} \, M^{-n}$ is obtained by linear CG solver for stochastic sources which needs considerable computational cost. Hence, we explore the possibility of cost reduction on the trace estimation by the adoption of gradient boosting decision tree algorithm. We also discuss effects of bias and its correction.</description>

      <title>Taste-splittings of staggered, Karsten-Wilczek and Borici-Creutz fermions under gradient flow in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Karsten-Wilczek and Borici-Creutz fermions show a near-degeneracy of the $2$ species involved, similar to the $2^{d/2}$ species of staggered fermions. Hence in $d=2$ dimensions all three formulations happen to be minimally doubled (two species). This near-degeneracy shows up both in the eigenvalue spectrum of the respective Dirac operator and in spectroscopic quantities (e.g. the pion mass), but in the former case it is easier to quantify. We use the quenched Schwinger model to determine the low-lying eigenvalues of these fermion operators at a fixed gradient flow time $\tau$ (either in lattice units or in physical units, hence keeping either $\tau/a^2$ or $e^2 \tau$ fixed at all $\beta$).</description>

      <title>Progress on the spectroscopy of an Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to matter in multiple representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report progress on our lattice calculations for the mass spectra of low-lying composite states in the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to two and three flavors of Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental and the two-index antisymmetric representations, respectively. This theory provides an ultraviolet completion to the composite Higgs model with Goldstone modes in the SU(4)/Sp(4) coset and with partial compositeness for generating the top-quark mass. We measure the meson and chimera baryon masses. These masses are crucial for constructing the composite Higgs model. In particular, the chimera baryon masses are important inputs for implementing top partial compositeness. We employ Wilson fermions and the Wilson plaquette action in our simulations. Techniques such as APE and Wuppertal smearing, as well as the procedure of generalised eigenvalue problem, are implemented in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly contributions to baryon masses from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lattice calculations of the masses of baryons containing the light, strange and charm quarks and their decompositions into sigma terms and trace anomaly. These results are obtained from 2+1 flavor QCD ensembles at 5 lattice spacings $a\in[0.05,0.11]$ fm, 4 spatial sizes $L\in[2.5, 5.1]$ fm, 7 pion masses $m_{\pi}\in[135,350]$ MeV, and several values of the strange quark mass. The continuum extrapolated masses of all the baryons agree with experiments at the 1\% level. We found that the glue part of the trace anomaly contributes about the same amount to the masses -- $\sim$ 0.8 - 0.95 GeV for the spin 1/2 baryons and $\sim$ 0.95 - 1.1 GeV for the spin 3/2 baryons -- given $\gamma_m\sim$ 0.3, and the sigma terms from the light, strange, and charm quarks are enhanced by factors of about 5, 2, and 1.3, respectively, compared to the renormalized quark mass themselves at \(\overline{\mathrm{MS}}\) 2 GeV.</description>

      <title>Scaling SU(2) to 1000 GPUs using HiRep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HiRep allows flexible simulations of higher representations of Wilson Fermions with various actions and gauge groups and a range of inverters and integrators. This is particularly important for enabling evaluations of observables relevant to phenomenological inputs for Beyond-the-Standard-Model physics from lattice field theory. We present progress on the GPU porting of available features, especially in terms of scaling to large jobs on AMD GPUs.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed P-wave tetraquark resonant states in the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive P-wave four-body dynamical calculations of the fully charmed tetraquark systems within the quark potential model. We apply the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, incorporating both dimeson and diquark-antidiquark spatial configurations. The matrix elements of P-wave states are calculated analytically using the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the complex scaling method, we obtain several fully charmed P-wave resonant states with compact tetraquark configuration in the mass region of $(7.0,7.2)$ GeV, including states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{-+}$. However, we find no resonant states with the mass $M&lt;7$ GeV and width $\Gamma&lt;200$ MeV. Combining the present investigation with our previous results on S-wave fully charmed tetraquark systems, candidates for the experimental states $X(6400)$ and $X(6600)$ are still absent in the quark model.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed up in Monte Carlo sampling through Radial Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very recently it has been shown that the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is guaranteed to converge exponentially to a given target probability distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-V(x)}$ on non-compact spaces if augmented by an appropriate radial update. In this work we present a simple way to derive efficient radial updates meeting the necessary requirements for any potential $V$. We reduce the task to finding a substitution of the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that the effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with $z\rightarrow\pm\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence. We show that choosing this update from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions yields very good results. We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Quark Density in Lattice QC$_2$D at Imaginary and Real Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.07442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study lattice two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) with two flavors of staggered fermions at imaginary and real quark chemical potential $\mu_q$ and $T&gt;T_c$. We employ various methods of extrapolation of the quark number density from imaginary to real quark chemical potentials $\mu_q$, including series expansions as well as analytic continuation based on phenomenological models, and study their accuracy by comparing the results to the lattice data. Below the Roberge-Weiss temperature, $T&lt;T_{RW}$, we find that the cluster expansion model provides an accurate analytic continuation of the baryon number density in the studied range of chemical potentials. On the other hand, the behavior of the reconstructed canonical partition functions indicates that the available models may require corrections at high quark densities. At $T&gt;T_{RW}$ we show that the analytic continuation to the real values of $\mu_q$ based on trigonometric functions works equally well with the conventional method based on the Taylor expansion in powers of $\mu_q$.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>
