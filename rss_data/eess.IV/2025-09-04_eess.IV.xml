      <title>Pan-Cancer mitotic figures detection and domain generalization: MIDOG 2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report details our submission to the Mitotic Domain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge, which addresses the critical task of mitotic figure detection in histopathology for cancer prognostication. Following the "Bitter Lesson"\cite{sutton2019bitterlesson} principle that emphasizes data scale over algorithmic novelty, we have publicly released two new datasets to bolster training data for both conventional \cite{Shen2024framework} and atypical mitoses \cite{shen_2025_16780587}. Besides, we implement up-to-date training methodologies for both track and reach a Track-1 F1-Score of 0.8407 on our test set, as well as a Track-2 balanced accuracy of 0.9107 for atypical mitotic cell classification.</description>

      <title>MitoDetect++: A Domain-Robust Pipeline for Mitosis Detection and Atypical Subtyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated detection and classification of mitotic figures especially distinguishing atypical from normal remain critical challenges in computational pathology. We present MitoDetect++, a unified deep learning pipeline designed for the MIDOG 2025 challenge, addressing both mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification. For detection (Track 1), we employ a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with EfficientNetV2-L as the backbone, enhanced with attention modules, and trained via combined segmentation losses. For classification (Track 2), we leverage the Virchow2 vision transformer, fine-tuned efficiently using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to minimize resource consumption. To improve generalization and mitigate domain shifts, we integrate strong augmentations, focal loss, and group-aware stratified 5-fold cross-validation. At inference, we deploy test-time augmentation (TTA) to boost robustness. Our method achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.892 across validation domains, highlighting its clinical applicability and scalability across tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a continuously growing availability of annotated datasets of mitotic figures in histology images, finding the best way to optimally use with this unprecedented amount of data to optimally train deep learning models has become a new challenge.

      <title>Normal and Atypical Mitosis Image Classifier using Efficient Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle atypical versus normal mitosis classification in the MIDOG 2025 challenge using EfficientViT-L2, a hybrid CNN--ViT architecture optimized for accuracy and efficiency. A unified dataset of 13,938 nuclei from seven cancer types (MIDOG++ and AMi-Br) was used, with atypical mitoses comprising ~15. To assess domain generalization, we applied leave-one-cancer-type-out cross-validation with 5-fold ensembles, using stain-deconvolution for image augmentation. For challenge submissions, we trained an ensemble with the same 5-fold split but on all cancer types. In the preliminary evaluation phase, this model achieved balanced accuracy of 0.859, ROC AUC of 0.942, and raw accuracy of 0.85, demonstrating competitive and well-balanced performance across metrics.</description>

      <title>Ensemble of Pathology Foundation Models for MIDOG 2025 Track 2: Atypical Mitosis Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitotic figures are classified into typical and atypical variants, with atypical counts correlating strongly with tumor aggressiveness. Accurate differentiation is therefore essential for patient prognostication and resource allocation, yet remains challenging even for expert pathologists. Here, we leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large histopathology datasets and applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation. During training, we employ a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving a high balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.</description>

      <title>Robust Pan-Cancer Mitotic Figure Detection with YOLOv12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitotic figures represent a key histoprognostic feature in tumor pathology, providing crucial insights into tumor aggressiveness and proliferation. However, their identification remains challenging, subject to significant inter-observer variability, even among experienced pathologists. To address this issue, the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge marks the third edition of an international competition aiming to develop robust mitosis detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a mitotic figures detection approach based on the YOLOv12 object detection architecture, achieving a $F_1$-score of 0.801 on the preliminary test set of the MIDOG 2025 challenge, without relying on external data.</description>

      <title>ConvNeXt with Histopathology-Specific Augmentations for Mitotic Figure Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate mitotic figure classification is crucial in computational pathology, as mitotic activity informs cancer grading and patient prognosis. Distinguishing atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), which indicate higher tumor aggressiveness, from normal mitotic figures (NMFs) remains challenging due to subtle morphological differences and high intra-class variability. This task is further complicated by domain shifts, including variations in organ, tissue type, and scanner, as well as limited annotations and severe class imbalance. To address these challenges in Track 2 of the MIDOG 2025 Challenge, we propose a solution based on the lightweight ConvNeXt architecture, trained on all available datasets (AMi-Br, AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD, and OMG-Octo) to maximize domain coverage. Robustness is enhanced through a histopathology-specific augmentation pipeline, including elastic and stain-specific transformations, and balanced sampling to mitigate class imbalance. A grouped 5-fold cross-validation strategy ensures reliable evaluation. On the preliminary leaderboard, our model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8961, ranking among the top entries. These results highlight that broad domain exposure combined with targeted augmentation strategies is key to building accurate and generalizable mitotic figure classifiers.</description>

      <title>Solutions for Mitotic Figure Detection and Atypical Classification in MIDOG 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in mitotic figure analysis within computational pathology. In this paper, we present our approach to the Mitosis Domain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 Challenge, which consists of two distinct tasks, i.e., mitotic figure detection and atypical mitosis classification. For the mitotic figure detection task, we propose a two-stage detection-classification framework that first localizes candidate mitotic figures and subsequently refines the predictions using a dedicated classification module. For the atypical mitosis classification task, we employ an ensemble strategy that integrates predictions from multiple state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to improve robustness and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods across both tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach which extends the existing Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detector (FCOS) for mitotic figure detection. Our composite model adds a Feedback Attention Ladder CNN (FAL-CNN) model for classification of normal versus abnormal mitotic figures, feeding into a fusion network that is trained to generate adjustments to bounding boxes predicted by FCOS. Our network aims to reduce the false positive rate of the FCOS object detector, to improve the accuracy of object detection and enhance the generalisability of the network. Our model achieved an F1 score of 0.655 for mitosis detection on the preliminary evaluation dataset.</description>

      <title>RF-DETR for Robust Mitotic Figure Detection: A MIDOG 2025 Track 1 Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitotic figure detection in histopathology images remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across different scanners, staining protocols, and tissue types. This paper presents our approach for the MIDOG 2025 challenge Track 1, focusing on robust mitotic figure detection across diverse histological contexts. While we initially planned a two-stage approach combining high-recall detection with subsequent classification refinement, time constraints led us to focus on optimizing a single-stage detection pipeline. We employed RF-DETR (Roboflow Detection Transformer) with hard negative mining, trained on MIDOG++ dataset. On the preliminary test set, our method achieved an F1 score of 0.789 with a recall of 0.839 and precision of 0.746, demonstrating effective generalization across unseen domains. The proposed solution offers insights into the importance of training data balance and hard negative mining for addressing domain shift challenges in mitotic figure detection.</description>

Abstract: This abstract presents our solution (Team Westwood) for mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification in the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge. For mitosis detection, we trained an nnUNetV2 for initial mitosis candidate screening with high sensitivity, followed by a random forest classifier ensembling predictions of three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and EfficientNetV2-s. For the atypical mitosis classification, we trained another random forest classifier ensembling the predictions of three CNNs: EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and InceptionV3. On the preliminary test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.7450 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8722 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solution for the MIDOG 2025 Challenge Track~2, addressing binary classification of normal mitotic figures (NMFs) versus atypical mitotic figures (AMFs). The approach leverages pathology-specific foundation model H-optimus-0, selected based on recent cross-domain generalization benchmarks and our empirical testing, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and MixUp augmentation. Implementation includes soft labels based on multi-expert consensus, hard negative mining, and adaptive focal loss, metric learning and domain adaptation. The method demonstrates both the promise and challenges of applying foundation models to this complex classification task, achieving reasonable performance in the preliminary evaluation phase.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoder Pretraining and BiXLSTM ResNet Architecture for PET/CT Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate segmentation of lesions in whole-body PET/CT imaging is es-sential for tumor characterization, treatment planning, and response assess-ment, yet current manual workflows are labor-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability. Automated deep learning methods have shown promise but often remain limited by modality specificity, isolated time points, or in-sufficient integration of expert knowledge. To address these challenges, we present a two-stage lesion segmentation framework developed for the fourth AutoPET Challenge. In the first stage, a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is em-ployed for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled PET/CT and longitudinal CT scans, enabling the extraction of robust modality-specific representations without manual annotations. In the second stage, the pretrained encoder is fine-tuned with a bidirectional XLSTM architecture augmented with ResNet blocks and a convolutional decoder. By jointly leveraging anatomical (CT) and functional (PET) information as complementary input channels, the model achieves improved temporal and spatial feature integration. Evalua-tion on the AutoPET Task 1 dataset demonstrates that self-supervised pre-training significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, achieving a Dice score of 0.582 compared to 0.543 without pretraining. These findings high-light the potential of combining self-supervised learning with multimodal fu-sion for robust and generalizable PET/CT lesion segmentation.

      <title>Towards Digital Twins for Optimal Radioembolization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radioembolization is a localized liver cancer treatment that delivers radioactive microspheres (30 micron) to tumors via a catheter inserted in the hepatic arterial tree. The goal is to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing damage to healthy liver tissue. However, optimization is challenging due to complex hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainty in microsphere transport. The creation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twins may provide a transformative solution to these challenges. This work outlines a framework for a liver radioembolization digital twin using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or recent physics-informed machine learning approaches. The CFD approach involves microsphere transport calculations in the hepatic arterial tree with individual patient data, which enables personalized treatment planning. Although accurate, traditional CFD is computationally expensive and limits clinical applicability.
  To accelerate simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their generative extensions play an increasingly important role. PINNs integrate governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, directly into the neural network training process, enabling mesh-free, data-efficient approximation of blood flow and microsphere transport. Physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs), diffusion models (PI-DMs), and transformer-based architectures further enable uncertainty-aware, temporally resolved predictions with reduced computational cost. These AI surrogates not only maintain physical fidelity but also support rapid sampling of diverse flow scenarios, facilitating real-time decision support.
  Together, CFD and physics-informed AI methods form the foundation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twin to optimize radioembolization planning and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Is Synthetic Image Augmentation Useful for Imbalanced Classification Problems? Case-Study on the MIDOG2025 Atypical Cell Detection Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MIDOG 2025 challenge extends prior work on mitotic figure detection by introducing a new Track 2 on atypical mitosis classification. This task aims to distinguish normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, a clinically relevant but highly imbalanced and cross-domain problem. We investigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on ImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via self-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs. 1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate class balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic data. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong performance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving slightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability. Synthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the organizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an out-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4 percent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy. These findings suggest that both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable for atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining conferring robustness and ImageNet pretraining reaching higher peaks, while naive synthetic balancing has limited benefit. Full hidden test set results will be reported upon challenge completion.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Strategy for Mitosis Detection Using Improved YOLO11x Proposals and ConvNeXt Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIDOG 2025 Track 1 requires mitosis detection in whole-slide images (WSIs) containing non-tumor, inflamed, and necrotic regions. Due to the complicated and heterogeneous context, as well as possible artifacts, there are often false positives and false negatives, thus degrading the detection F1-score. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage framework. Firstly, an improved YOLO11x, integrated with EMA attention and LSConv, is employed to generate mitosis candidates. We use a low confidence threshold to generate as many proposals as possible, ensuring the detection recall. Then, a ConvNeXt-Tiny classifier is employed to filter out the false positives, ensuring the detection precision. Consequently, the proposed two-stage framework can generate a high detection F1-score. Evaluated on a fused dataset comprising MIDOG++, MITOS_WSI_CCMCT, and MITOS_WSI_CMC, our framework achieves an F1-score of 0.882, which is 0.035 higher than the single-stage YOLO11x baseline. This performance gain is produced by a significant precision improvement, from 0.762 to 0.839, and a comparable recall. The code is available at https://github.com/xxiao0304/MIDOG-2025-Track-1-of-SZTU.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Lessons from MIDOG 2025: A Two-Stage Approach to Domain-Robust Mitotic Figure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitotic figure detection remains a challenging task in computational pathology due to domain variability and morphological complexity. This paper describes our participation in the MIDOG 2025 challenge, focusing on robust mitotic figure detection across diverse tissue domains. We developed a two-stage pipeline combining Faster R-CNN for candidate detection with an ensemble of three classifiers (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-v2, InceptionResNet-v2) for false positive reduction. Our best submission achieved F1-score 0.2237 (Recall: 0.9528, Precision: 0.1267) using a Faster R-CNN trained solely on MIDOG++ dataset. While our high recall demonstrates effective mitotic figure detection, the critically low precision (12.67%) reveals fundamental challenges in distinguishing true mitoses from morphologically similar imposters across diverse domains. Analysis of six submission variants showed that subsequent optimization attempts were counterproductive, highlighting the omplexity of domain generalization in histopathology. This work provides valuable insights into the practical challenges of developing robust mitotic figure detection algorithms and emphasizes the importance of effective false positive suppression strategies.</description>

      <title>A Single Detect Focused YOLO Framework for Robust Mitotic Figure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitotic figure detection is a crucial task in computational pathology, as mitotic activity serves as a strong prognostic marker for tumor aggressiveness. However, domain variability that arises from differences in scanners, tissue types, and staining protocols poses a major challenge to the robustness of automated detection methods. In this study, we introduce SDF-YOLO (Single Detect Focused YOLO), a lightweight yet domain-robust detection framework designed specifically for small, rare targets such as mitotic figures. The model builds on YOLOv11 with task-specific modifications, including a single detection head aligned with mitotic figure scale, coordinate attention to enhance positional sensitivity, and improved cross-channel feature mixing. Experiments were conducted on three datasets that span human and canine tumors: MIDOG ++, canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CCMCT), and canine mammary carcinoma (CMC). When submitted to the preliminary test set for the MIDOG2025 challenge, SDF-YOLO achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.799, with a precision of 0.758, a recall of 0.775, an F1 score of 0.766, and an FROC-AUC of 5.793, demonstrating both competitive accuracy and computational efficiency. These results indicate that SDF-YOLO provides a reliable and efficient framework for robust mitotic figure detection across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning Strategies for Mitotic Figure Classification in MIDOG2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are clinically relevant indicators of abnormal cell division, yet their reliable detection remains challenging due to morphological ambiguity and scanner variability. In this work, we investigated three variants of adapting the pathology foundation model UNI2-h for the MIDOG2025 Track 2 challenge. Starting from a LoRA-based baseline, we found that visual prompt tuning (VPT) substantially improved generalization, and that further integrating test-time augmentation (TTA) with Vahadane and Macenko stain normalization provided the best robustness. Our final submission achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8837 and an ROC-AUC of 0.9513 on the preliminary leaderboard, ranking within the top 10 teams. These results demonstrate that prompt-based adaptation combined with stain-normalization TTA offers an effective strategy for atypical mitosis classification under diverse imaging conditions.</description>

      <title>Ensemble YOLO Framework for Multi-Domain Mitotic Figure Detection in Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate detection of mitotic figures in whole slide histopathological images remains a challenging task due to their scarcity, morphological heterogeneity, and the variability introduced by tissue preparation and staining protocols. The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on MIDOG++, CMC, and CCMCT datasets. To enhance robustness, training incorporated stain-invariant color perturbations and texture preserving augmentations. In internal validation, YOLOv5 achieved superior precision, while YOLOv8 provided improved recall, reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and anchor-free detection. To capitalize on these complementary strengths, we employed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity without a major reduction in precision. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ensemble strategies built upon contemporary object detectors to advance automated mitosis detection in digital pathology.</description>

      <title>Deep Self-knowledge Distillation: A hierarchical supervised learning for coronary artery segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the critical importance of precise diagnosis through X-ray angiography. Manual coronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and inefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing methods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like poor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge distillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the hierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and insufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for segmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep Self-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation that leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method enhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical learning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model. Our method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector with tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization for the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU compared to other models in comparative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Guided Patch UNet-VAE with Adversarial Supervision for Adrenal Gland Segmentation in Computed Tomography Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of small and irregularly shaped abdominal organs, such as the adrenal glands in CT imaging, remains a persistent challenge due to severe class imbalance, poor spatial context, and limited annotated data. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines variational reconstruction, supervised segmentation, and adversarial patch-based feedback to address these limitations in a principled and scalable manner. Our architecture is built upon a VAE-UNet backbone that jointly reconstructs input patches and generates voxel-level segmentation masks, allowing the model to learn disentangled representations of anatomical structure and appearance. We introduce a patch-based training pipeline that selectively injects synthetic patches generated from the learned latent space, and systematically study the effects of varying synthetic-to-real patch ratios during training. To further enhance output fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss using VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial supervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative training regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generalist versus Specialist Vision Foundation Models for Ocular Disease and Oculomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data, demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications. RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for future medical foundation models.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Optoelectronic Sensor for Early Screening of Citrus Greening in Leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citrus greening, or Huanglongbing (HLB), is a serious disease affecting citrus crops, with no known cure. Early detection is essential, but current methods are often expensive. To address this, a low-cost, portable sensor was developed to distinguish between HLB-infected and healthy citrus leaves using a LED-based optical sensing circuit. The device uses white and infrared (IR) LEDs to illuminate the adaxial leaf surface and measures change in reflectance intensities caused by differences in biochemical compositions between healthy and HLB-infected leaves. These changes, analyzed across four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and IR), were processed using machine learning models, including Random Forest. Experimental results indicated that the IR band was the most effective, with the Random Forest model achieving an accuracy of 89.58% and precision of 93.75%. Similarly, the green band also achieved an accuracy of 85.42% and precision of 90.62%. These results suggest that this LED-based optical system could be a hand-held screening tool for early detection of HLB, providing small-scale farmers with a cost-effective solution.</description>

      <title>EdgeAttNet: Towards Barb-Aware Filament Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster inference performance suitable for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Image-Guided Surgery: Technology, Quality, Innovation, and Opportunities for Medical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The science and clinical practice of medical physics has been integral to the advancement of radiology and radiation therapy for over a century. In parallel, advances in surgery - including intraoperative imaging, registration, and other technologies within the expertise of medical physicists - have advanced primarily in connection to other disciplines, such as biomedical engineering and computer science, and via somewhat distinct translational paths. This review article briefly traces the parallel and convergent evolution of such scientific, engineering, and clinical domains with an eye to a potentially broader, more impactful role of medical physics in research and clinical practice of surgery. A review of image-guided surgery technologies is offered, including intraoperative imaging, tracking / navigation, image registration, visualization, and surgical robotics across a spectrum of surgical applications. Trends and drivers for research and innovation are traced, including federal funding and academic-industry partnership, and some of the major challenges to achieving major clinical impact are described. Opportunities for medical physicists to expand expertise and contribute to the advancement of surgery in the decade ahead are outlined, including research and innovation, data science approaches, improving efficiency through operations research and optimization, improving patient safety, and bringing rigorous quality assurance to technologies and processes in the circle of care for surgery. Challenges abound but appear tractable, including domain knowledge, professional qualifications, and the need for investment and clinical partnership.</description>

      <title>From Image Denoisers to Regularizing Imaging Inverse Problems: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems lie at the heart of modern imaging science, with broad applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and microscopy. Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in solving imaging inverse problems, where data-driven regularizers are used increasingly, leading to remarkably high-fidelity reconstruction. A particularly notable approach for data-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors in iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms, commonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a brief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short review of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal splitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned denoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such replacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting optimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the foundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent diffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances regarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal settings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy for convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local homogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design, including choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Feature Mapping GAP: Integrating Real HDRTV Priors for Superior SDRTV-to-HDRTV Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of HDR-WCG display devices has highlighted the need to convert SDRTV to HDRTV, as most video sources are still in SDR. Existing methods primarily focus on designing neural networks to learn a single-style mapping from SDRTV to HDRTV. However, the limited information in SDRTV and the diversity of styles in real-world conversions render this process an ill-posed problem, thereby constraining the performance and generalization of these methods. Inspired by generative approaches, we propose a novel method for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion guided by real HDRTV priors. Despite the limited information in SDRTV, introducing real HDRTV as reference priors significantly constrains the solution space of the originally high-dimensional ill-posed problem. This shift transforms the task from solving an unreferenced prediction problem to making a referenced selection, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the conversion process. Specifically, our approach comprises two stages: the first stage employs a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network to capture HDRTV priors, while the second stage matches these priors to the input SDRTV content to recover realistic HDRTV outputs. We evaluate our method on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness with significant improvements in both objective and subjective metrics across real and synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Embedding Similarity Guided License Plate Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques play a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of low-resolution images, particularly for applications such as security and surveillance, where accurate license plate recognition is crucial. This study proposes a novel framework that combines pixel-based loss with embedding similarity learning to address the unique challenges of license plate super-resolution (LPSR). The introduced pixel and embedding consistency loss (PECL) integrates a Siamese network and applies contrastive loss to force embedding similarities to improve perceptual and structural fidelity. By effectively balancing pixel-wise accuracy with embedding-level consistency, the framework achieves superior alignment of fine-grained features between high-resolution (HR) and super-resolved (SR) license plates. Extensive experiments on the CCPD and PKU dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed framework, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy. These results highlight the potential of embedding similarity learning to advance both perceptual quality and task-specific performance in extreme super-resolution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication with Entropy-and-Channel-Adaptive Rate Control over Multi-User MIMO Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although significant improvements in transmission efficiency have been achieved, existing semantic communication (SemCom) methods typically use a fixed transmission rate for varying channel conditions and transmission contents, leading to performance degradation under harsh channel conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SemCom method for wireless image transmission that integrates entropy-andchannel-adaptive rate control mechanism, specifically designed for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) fading channels. Unlike existing methods, our system dynamically adjusts transmission rates by leveraging the entropy of feature maps, channel state information (CSI), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ensuring optimal communication resource usage. It incorporates feature map pruning, channel attention, spatial attention, and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to effectively prioritize critical semantic features while minimizing unnecessary transmission overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms separated source and channel coding and deep joint source and channel coding (Deep JSCC), in terms of rate-distortion performance, flexibility, and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios such as low SNR, imperfect CSI, and inter-user interference.</description>

      <title>Towards Cardiac MRI Foundation Models: Comprehensive Visual-Tabular Representations for Whole-Heart Assessment and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Medical Image Binding via Shared Text Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically, based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text, M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.</description>

      <title>Grid-Reg: Detector-Free Gridized Feature Learning and Matching for Large-Scale SAR-Optical Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is highly challenging to register large-scale, heterogeneous SAR and optical images, particularly across platforms, due to significant geometric, radiometric, and temporal differences, which most existing methods struggle to address. To overcome these challenges, we propose Grid-Reg, a grid-based multimodal registration framework comprising a domain-robust descriptor extraction network, Hybrid Siamese Correlation Metric Learning Network (HSCMLNet), and a grid-based solver (Grid-Solver) for transformation parameter estimation. In heterogeneous imagery with large modality gaps and geometric differences, obtaining accurate correspondences is inherently difficult. To robustly measure similarity between gridded patches, HSCMLNet integrates a hybrid Siamese module with a correlation metric learning module (CMLModule) based on equiangular unit basis vectors (EUBVs), together with a manifold consistency loss to promote modality-invariant, discriminative feature learning. The Grid-Solver estimates transformation parameters by minimizing a global grid matching loss through a progressive dual-loop search strategy to reliably find patch correspondences across entire images. Furthermore, we curate a challenging benchmark dataset for SAR-to-optical registration using real-world UAV MiniSAR data and Google Earth optical imagery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Recombination: Systematic Real Data Augmentation Using Robotic Targets for LiDAR Perception Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validation of LiDAR-based perception of intelligent mobile systems operating in open-world applications remains a challenge due to the variability of real environmental conditions. Virtual simulations allow the generation of arbitrary scenes under controlled conditions but lack physical sensor characteristics, such as intensity responses or material-dependent effects. In contrast, real-world data offers true sensor realism but provides less control over influencing factors, hindering sufficient validation. Existing approaches address this problem with augmentation of real-world point cloud data by transferring objects between scenes. However, these methods do not consider validation and remain limited in controllability because they rely on empirical data. We solve these limitations by proposing Point Cloud Recombination, which systematically augments captured point cloud scenes by integrating point clouds acquired from physical target objects measured in controlled laboratory environments. Thus enabling the creation of vast amounts and varieties of repeatable, physically accurate test scenes with respect to phenomena-aware occlusions with registered 3D meshes. Using the Ouster OS1-128 Rev7 sensor, we demonstrate the augmentation of real-world urban and rural scenes with humanoid targets featuring varied clothing and poses, for repeatable positioning. We show that the recombined scenes closely match real sensor outputs, enabling targeted testing, scalable failure analysis, and improved system safety. By providing controlled yet sensor-realistic data, our method enables trustworthy conclusions about the limitations of specific sensors in compound with their algorithms, e.g., object detection.</description>

      <title>DeepTopoNet: A Framework for Subglacial Topography Estimation on the Greenland Ice Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding Greenland's subglacial topography is critical for projecting the future mass loss of the ice sheet and its contribution to global sea-level rise. However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data, particularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet, significantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is traditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice thickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of kilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning framework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice thickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic loss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography, BedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass conservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate high-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively adjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in areas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution of BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates. Our approach incorporates gradient-based and trend surface features to enhance model performance and utilizes a CNN architecture designed for subgrid-scale predictions. By systematically testing on the Upernavik Isstr{\o}m) region, the model achieves high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods in reconstructing subglacial terrain. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in bridging observational gaps, providing a scalable and efficient solution to inferring subglacial topography.</description>
