      <title>The role of micro-credentials in the future digitalized AI-driven education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on assessing the potential of micro-credentials in digitalized higher education in the era of artificial intelligence. Micro-credentials are commonly described as mini qualifications or digital badges that certify an individual competency in a specific skill or cluster of skills. Being different from traditional academic credentials in both their granularity and focus, micro-credentials represent a new and exciting topic that is rapidly gaining popularity all around the world both within higher educational institutions, such as public and private universities, as well as within other education providers, such as non-governmental organizations and SMEs. The popularity of micro-credentials has been further enhanced by the recent COVID-19 pandemic which caused digital surge in higher education leading to many rapid technological innovations and changes that were unthinkable before. The rising interest in micro-credentialing can be best demonstrated by the increase of the number of scientific publications on this topic from just 1 in 1992 to 165 in 2024. The paper employs a comprehensive bibliometric network analysis using the terms micro-credentials based on a sample of 608 selected publications indexed in the Scopus database. It carries out the network cluster analysis using both text data as well as bibliometric data with the help of VOSviewer software. The results and outcomes of this research might be helpful for researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers in devising effective strategies and policies for transforming the future digitalized AI-driven higher education.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Indirectness in Public Cheap-Talk Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linguistic indirectness when speakers attend to social ties. Social ties are modeled by a graph, and conferences are the sets of nodes that hear a message. Conference worth is a distance polynomial on the graph; allocations are given by the Myerson value of the conference-restricted worth, which yields the bargaining-power components for each participant. Aggregating these components gives an effective bias that, via a Partition-Threshold rule, pins down the number of equilibrium message partitions in a cheap talk game. Results: (i) among trees, stars maximize worth, leading to weakly fewer equilibrium partitions; (ii) on stars, we derive closed-form effective biases, with a witness-hub marginal effect of adding leaves changing sign at $\delta^{\ast}=0.6$; (iii) for two stars joined by one link, two-star (hub-hub) vs big-star (hub-leaf) precision flips at 8/15 for the same number of nodes; private leaf-leaf conferences are most informative.</description>

      <title>Marginal Productivity Theory versus the Labor Theory of Property: An analysis using vectorial marginal products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neoclassical economic theory presents marginal productivity (MP) theory using the scalar notion of marginal products, and takes pains, implicitly or explicitly, to show that competitive equilibrium satisfies the supposedly ethical principle: ``To each what he and the instruments he owns produces.'' This paper shows that MP theory can also be formulated in a mathematically equivalent way using vectorial marginal products--which however conflicts with the above-mentioned ``distributive shares'' picture. Vectorial MP theory also facilitates the presentation of modern treatment of the labor theory of property which on the descriptive side is based on the fact that, contrary to the distributive shares picture, one legal party gets the production vector consisting of 100 percent of the liabilities for the used-up inputs and 100 percent of the produced outputs in a productive opportunity. On the normative side, the labor theory of property is just the application of the usual juridical norm of imputation to the question of property appropriation.
  Keywords: marginal productivity theory, property theory, imputation of responsibility, vectorial marginal products

      <title>Classification in Equilibrium: Structure of Optimal Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes optimal classification when individuals adjust their behavior in response to the classification rule. We model the interaction between a designer and a population as a Stackelberg game: the designer selects a classification rule anticipating how individuals will comply, cheat, or abstain in order to obtain a favorable classification. Under standard monotone likelihood ratio assumptions, optimal rules belong to a small and interpretable family (single-threshold and two-cut rules) that encompass both conventional and counterintuitive designs. Our results depart sharply from prior findings that optimal classifiers reward higher signals: in equilibrium, the designer may deliberately reward those with lower likelihood ratios or concentrate rewards/penalties in a middle band to improve informational quality.</description>

      <title>Comparisons of Experiments in Moral Hazard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12476v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I use a novel geometric approach to compare information in moral hazard problems. I study three nested geometric orders on information, namely the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope orders. The orders are defined by the inclusion of the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope of the matrices representing the experiments. For each order, I establish four equivalent characterizations of the orders (i) inclusion of feasible state dependent utility sets, (ii) matrix factorizations, (iii) posterior belief distributions, and (iv) improved incentives in certain moral hazard problems. The column space order characterizes the comparison of implementability in all moral hazard problems. The conic span order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems with a risk neutral agent and limited liability. The zonotope order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems when the agent can have any utility exhibiting risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Achieving Irrational Correlated Equilibria without Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the implementation and performance of a decentralized information transmission mechanism in game with complete or incomplete games. We propose a mechanism that realizes irrational correlated equilibria or irrational communication equilibria through a finite rounds of cheap talk without mediator. Designed for games with at least five players, the core procedure involves three players decomposing and encrypting the equilibrium, while two other players securely randomize and deliver the encrypted recommended strategies to designated players. Our results demonstrate that all irrational correlated equilibria or irrational communication equilibria can be achieved through this mechanism, which is both strategically robust and practically implementable.</description>

      <title>Expert Incentives under Partially Contractible States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study whether and which expert incentives can be provided at what cost when the states of the world become non-contractible, but there is some noisy observation about the states that can be contracted upon. A principal hires an agent to acquire costly information about the states, but it is not possible to pay the agent based on the realized states. Instead, the principal has access to a noisy (Blackwell) experiment about the states, and can pay bonuses based on its realization. The agent is risk neutral and protected by limited liability. I completely characterize what the principal can incentivize the agent to learn, and how to design contracts to minimize the costs to provide such incentives. I then study which contractible information is always better at incentive provision. This gives rise to a novel order on information. In the binary-binary case, this order is characterized by larger differences in the likelihood ratios of the two realizations. My results provide insights into what information is better for evaluating expert predictions.</description>

      <title>Honesty, Stigma, and Cooperation in an Overlapping-Generations Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an overlapping-generations model of community enforcement where each agent interacts once as young and once as old across two groups. After each match a minimal, directed record assigns a public "stigma" only when a player defects against a cooperator; the label is observed solely by the defector's next partner. A known fraction of agents are honest (cooperate unless the opponent is stigmatized); the rest are strategic and privately heterogeneous in the cost of being exploited. We characterize symmetric cutoff equilibria for strategic young players. When the one-shot gain from defection is moderate, the equilibrium exists and is unique; when it is large, multiple equilibria arise. In that region, increasing the share of honest types can reduce cooperation by shifting selection toward a lower cutoff - an "honesty backfires" effect. We further show that probabilistic record-clearing weakly lowers cutoffs and never expands the cooperation region. The results yield design lessons for reputation systems: target clear opportunism and avoid mechanically forgiving records, as persistence of credible negative signals disciplines behavior across cohorts.</description>

      <title>Public Communication in Regime Change games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a regime change game in which the state and an opposition leader both observe the regime's true strength and may engage in costly communication by manipulating the mean of citizens' private signals. Each citizen then decides whether to attack the regime; the citizens take their private signals at face value and do not discount or attempt to undo propaganda or counter-propaganda. From the perspective of both the state and the opposition, the size of the attack is uncertain, as the number of committed partisans - those who always attack regardless of their signal - is not observed in advance. We show that a regime on the brink of collapse optimally refrains from propaganda, while the opposition engages in counter-propaganda. The equilibrium level of counter-propaganda increases with the opposition's benefit-cost ratio and with the precision of citizens' private signals, and decreases with the cost of attacking.</description>

      <title>Strategic Learning with Asymmetric Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a dynamic interaction between a fully rational, privately informed sender and a boundedly rational, uninformed receiver with memory constraints. The sender controls the flow of information, while the receiver designs a decision-making protocol that uses a finite state space to learn and to provide incentives. We characterize optimal protocols and quantify the scope for manipulation and the incentive cost of guarding against it. We show that distinctive behavioral patterns that might otherwise appear erratic or psychologically driven -- such as information disengagement, opinion polarization conditional on the same information, and indecision near the decision point -- emerge as systematic equilibrium responses to asymmetric rationality and information. The model provides an expressive framework for procedural rationality in strategic settings.</description>
