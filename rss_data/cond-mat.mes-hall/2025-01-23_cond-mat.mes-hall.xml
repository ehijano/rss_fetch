      <title>Universal scaling of electrostatic effects of a curved counter-electrode on the emitter field enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on field electron emission from single-tip nanoemitters have typically been carried out using a counter-electrode with a finite curvature radius $R$, positioned at a distance $d_{\rm{gap}}$ from the emitter's apex. The effects of the counter-electrode's curvature on the apex field enhancement factor ($\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$) of the emitter are still not understood. In this Letter, we theoretically explore how the apex field enhancement factor of an emitter, represented by a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) with apex radius $r_{\rm{a}} = 50$nm, is influenced by the curvature of a spherical-shaped counter-electrode. Importantly, our results show that for HCPs with sharpness aspect ratios typically between $10^2$ and $10^3$, there is a universal scaling such that $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}} = \gamma_{\rm{Pa}} \Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$, where $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ represents the apex field enhancement factor for the emitter assuming a planar counter-electrode, and $\Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$ is a universal scaling function such that $\Psi \sim 1$ for ${R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \gg 1$ and $\Psi \sim \left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ close to unity, for $ {R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \ll 1$. These findings help partially explain discrepancies observed in orhtodox field electron emission experiments, who reported that the effective $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$ values extracted from the current-voltage characteristics of single-tip carbon nanotubes typically underestimate the theoretical $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ values when $R \sim d_{\rm{gap}} \gg r_{\rm{a}}$, a trend that is predicted by our results.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Field-Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching via spin splitting torque in Altermagnetic RuO2-based Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) has emerged as a promising method for achieving energy-efficient magnetization switching in advanced spintronic devices. However, technological advancement has been inadequate because an external in-plane magnetic field is required to attain deterministic switching. Several approaches have been explored to address these challenges. In this work, we explored the potential of a newly emerged altermagnetic material RuO2 in combination with a Pt layer to achieve both field-free and low-power switching concurrently. We leveraged out-of-plane (OOP) spin polarization via the spin-splitter effect (SSE) in RuO2 for field-free switching (FFS) and in-plane spin polarization combined with spin Hall effect (SHE) in Pt for enhanced SOT efficiency. We revealed that the effective OOP magnetic field and FFS can be maximized by tuning the nominal thickness of the Pt underlayer and the direction of the applied current. We observed a significant enhancement in FFS at an optimized Pt thickness of 1.5 nm for an applied current density as low as 2.56e11 A/m2 at a crystal angle of 90 deg. Our study paves the way for energy-efficient spintronics devices for non-volatile memory, logic circuits, and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Giant Third-Order Nonlinearity Induced by the Quantum Metric Quadrupole in Few-Layer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric properties of topological materials underpin many exotic physical phenomena and applications. Quantum nonlinearity has emerged as a powerful probe for revealing these properties. The Berry curvature dipole in nonmagnetic materials and the quantum metric dipole in antiferromagnets have been explored by studying the second-order nonlinear Hall effect. Although the quadrupole moment of the quantum geometric tensor is theoretically predicted to induce higher-order quantum nonlinearity, the quantum metric quadrupole remains experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the quantum metric quadrupole induced third-order nonlinear longitudinal electrical response in few-layer WTe2, persisting up to room temperature. Angle-resolved third-harmonic current-voltage characteristics are found consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetry of WTe2. Through temperature variation and scaling analysis, we identify the quantum metric quadrupole as the physical origin of the observed third-order longitudinal nonlinearity. Additionally, we determine the angle dependence of the quantum metric quadrupole, establishing third-order nonlinearity as an efficient method for revealing the quantum metric structure.</description>

      <title>Engineering nonlinear Hall effect in bilayer graphene/black phosphorus heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for generating emergent quantum phenomena through symmetry breaking. Stacking-induced symmetry breaking at interfaces provides an effective method to modulate their electronic properties for functional devices. Here, we strategically stack bilayer graphene with black phosphorus, a low-symmetry semiconductor, to break the symmetries and induce the nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) that can persist up to room temperature. Intriguingly, it is found the NLHE undergoes sign reversals by varying the electrical displacement field under fixed carrier density. The scaling analysis reveals that the sign reversal of the NLHE is contributed from both the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and extrinsic scatterings. The displacement field-induced sign reversal of the BCD indicates asymmetric distributions of Berry curvature hot spots across different Fermi pockets in bilayer graphene. Our findings suggest that symmetry engineering of van der Waals heterostructures is promising for room-temperature applications based on nonlinear quantum devices, such as high-frequency rectifiers and wireless charging.</description>

      <title>Heat Transport Hysteresis Generated through Frequency Switching of a Time-Dependent Temperature Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic energetics framework is applied to examine how periodically shifting the frequency of a time-dependent oscillating temperature gradient affects heat transport in a nanoscale molecular model. We specifically examine the effects that frequency switching, i.e., instantaneously changing the oscillation frequency of the temperature gradient, has on the shape of the heat transport hysteresis curves generated by a particle connected to two thermal baths, each with a temperature that is oscillating in time. Analytical expressions are derived for the energy fluxes in/out of the system and the baths, with excellent agreement observed between the analytical expressions and the results from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the shape of the heat transport hysteresis curves can be significantly altered by shifting the frequency between fast and slow oscillation regimes. We also observe the emergence of features in the hysteresis curves such as pinched loops and complex multi-loop patterns due to the frequency shifting. The presented results have implications in the design of thermal neuromorphic devices such as thermal memristors and thermal memcapacitors.</description>

      <title>Strong shape-dependent intensity of inelastic light scattering by gold nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical approach to calculate inelastic light scattering spectra from gold nanocrystals, based on the finite element method. This approach is validated by comparison with previous analytic calculations for spherically symmetric scatterers. Superellipsoid nanocrystals are considered in order to smoothly vary the shape from octahedra to cubes via spheres, while preserving cubic symmetry. Spectra are calculated and discussed taking into account the irreducible representation of the involved vibration modes. A strong increase in the inelastically scattered light intensity is observed for small variations of the shape around the sphere. This increase is related to variations of the electric field inside the nanocrystals, which are very small for small nanospheres but increase quickly for non-spherical nanocrystals. This strong dependence with shape must be taken into account when interpreting experimental spectra acquired from inhomogeneous ensembles of nanocrystals whose shape dispersion are usually neglected. The overall changes in the spectra when varying the shape of the nanocrystals provide additional insight into previously published results. Preliminary calculations for chiral shapes further show a significant difference between spectra obtained with right or left circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>Energy symmetry and interlayer wave function ratio of tunneling electrons in partially overlapped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillations of tunneling probability concerning the tunneling barrier thickness have been less studied than the decay length. In this paper, we theoretically study the dependence of the tunneling probability on the electron energy $E$ and barrier thickness, or overlap length, in partially overlapped graphene where a gap is formed only in the central bilayer region due to a perpendicular electric field. We compare an $\uparrow$ junction, where the current path must pass through interlayer states, with a $\downarrow$ junction, where such interlayer transmission is not required. The valley-reversed tunneling probability of the $\uparrow$ junction is symmetric concerning $E$, whereas other tunneling probabilities are not. Additionally, the valley valve effect spans the entire energy gap in double $\uparrow$ junctions, whereas it occurs only within a much narrower energy range in double $\downarrow$ junctions. Surprisingly, these results suggest that the interlayer wavefunction ratio $\beta$ has a more significant effect in the $\downarrow$ junction than in the $\uparrow$ junction. This can be understood through the energy symmetry arising from chirality operation, $\pi$ rotation, and probability conservation. This energy symmetry offers a new perspective for analyzing the effects of $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Coupling of plasmons to the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of magnons and plasmons offers a promising avenue for hybrid quantum systems, facilitating coherent energy and information transfer between magnetic and charge excitations. However, existing mechanisms often depend on weak spin-orbit coupling or temperature-activated processes, limiting their robustness for low-temperature quantum technologies. Here, we propose a novel coupling mechanism between plasmons and the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnetic insulators, which operates at zero temperature and does not require spin-orbit coupling. Using a model system consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas on an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate, we show that the electric field of the plasmons interacts with the magnetically mediated electric polarization in the antiferromagnet, arising from bonds with broken inversion symmetry. This interaction enables strong coupling to the spin-conserving two-magnon continuum, allowing for efficient hybridization.</description>

      <title>Super-enhanced Sensitivity in Non-Hermitian Systems at Infernal Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems represents an intriguing phenomenon characterized by the coalescence of eigenenergies and eigenstates. When a system approaches an exceptional point, it exhibits a heightened sensitivity to perturbations compared to the conventional band degeneracy observed in Hermitian systems. This sensitivity, manifested in the splitting of the eigenenergies, is amplified as the order of the exceptional point increases. Infernal points constitute a unique subclass of exceptional points, distinguished by their order escalating with the expansion of the system's size. In this paper, we show that, when a non-Hermitian system is at an infernal point, a perturbation of strength $\epsilon$, which couples the two opposing boundaries of the system, causes the eigenenergies to split according to the law $\sqrt[k]{\epsilon}$, where $k$ is an integer proportional to the system's size. Utilizing the perturbation theory of Jordan matrices, we demonstrate that the exceptional sensitivity of the eigenenergies at infernal points to boundary-coupling perturbations is a ubiquitous phenomenon, irrespective of the specific form of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Notably, we find that this phenomenon remains robust even when the system deviates slightly from the infernal point. The universal nature and robustness of this phenomenon suggest potential applications in enhancing sensor sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor/Quantum Hall Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a Chern insulator in the integer quantum Hall (QH) regime. Our results show that the effective interaction at this boundary gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons at the SC/QH interface. These fields couple to a gauge field that includes both Chern-Simons term, originating from the QH sector, and Maxwell term. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of magnetic flux vortices on the SC/QH interface. The emergence of the Chern-Simons term significantly modifies the magnetic penetration depth, influencing the Abrikosov lattice period and potentially altering the superconducting behavior at the interface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vortex solutions at the interface carry a fractional charge of $e/2$, which reflects the ratio between the effective Chern-Simons level parameter and the charge of the Cooper pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy to study the coherent interaction of excited exciton states in WSe2 and MoSe2 monolayers via the optical Stark effect. For co-circularly polarized pump and probe, we measure a blueshift which points to a repulsive interaction between the 2s and 1s exciton states. The determined 2s-1s interaction strength is on par with that of the 1s-1s, in agreement with the semiconductor Bloch equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a 2s-1s biexciton bound state in the cross-circular configuration in both materials and determine their binding energy.</description>

      <title>Hole Transfer Dynamics in Thin Films of Mixed-Dimensional Quasi-2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of charge transfer processes in mixed-dimensional quasi-2D perovskites is crucial for their application in high-performance photovoltaic devices. In this work, we investigate the link between charge transport dynamics and morphology in a thin film of quasi-2D perovskites (PEA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1), grown with a distinct dimensionality gradient, where the n=1 phase is concentrated near the substrate and phases with higher dimensionality progressively increase in concentration toward the surface. By selectively exciting the n=4 phase, we observe efficient hole transfer to the n=2 and n=3 phases occurring within few tens of picoseconds after excitation. In contrast, the n=1 phase acts as a hole-blocking layer, limiting the overall charge transport efficiency. These results emphasize the critical importance of minimizing or eliminating the n=1 layer to enhance charge carrier separation and transport, offering valuable insights into the optimization of quasi-2D perovskite-based solar cells.</description>

Abstract: We report the observation of current-modulated magnetoresistance hysteresis below the superconducting transition temperature in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This highly tunable hysteresis behavior is confined to the superconducting state and vanishes when superconductivity is fully suppressed, directly linking magnetoresistance hysteresis to the superconducting order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Additionally, the superconducting diode effect driven by a small magnetic field is observed, indicating the enhanced electronic magnetochiral anisotropy by the chiral domain-wall scattering. Our findings position CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring nontrivial physical phenomena, including unconventional pairing mechanisms and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Inducing Spin Splitting and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in A-Type AFM Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$ through Electric Field and Janus Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are distinguished by zero net magnetic moment, high resistance to external magnetic disturbances, and ultrafast dynamic responses. For advancing AFM materials in spintronic and valleytronic applications, achieving spontaneous valley polarization and the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) is pivotal. We predict an A-type AFM monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, which shows a significant spontaneous valley polarization of 157 meV. In Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, spatial inversion symmetry (P) and time-reversal symmetry (T) are individually broken, yet the combined PT symmetry is preserved. This symmetry conservation leads to spin degeneracy, resulting in zero Berry curvature in the momentum space and absence of AVHE. However, a layer-locked hidden Berry curvature is produced, leading to the observation of the valley layer-spin Hall effect. Further, an external out-of-plane electric field can induce spin splitting by introducing layer-dependent electrostatic potential, enabling the layer-locked AVHE. Additionally, the introduction of a built-in electric field caused by the Janus structure also induces spin splitting in monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)F due to the electric-potential-difference-AFM mechanism. The high out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and realization of AVHE, offer promising opportunities for next-generation spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Microtubes and nanomembranes by ion-beam-induced exfoliation of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports an innovative process to fabricate $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ microtubes and nanomembranes based on ion implantation in (100)-oriented single-crystals. We show that, under specific flux and fluence conditions, the irradiation-induced strain profile promotes the detachment and rolling-up of a thin surface layer, forming a microtube. The strain-disorder interplay was investigated in detail for Cr-implanted $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ with a range of complementary methods, showing an excellent agreement between experimental and simulation data, and suggesting an exfoliation mechanism that is correlated with the anisotropic nature of the $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ monoclinic system and its easy-cleavage planes. Moreover, these microtubes can be unrolled upon a subsequent annealing step, resulting in nanomembranes with bulk-like crystalline quality that can be transferred to other substrates. The recovery of the implantation-induced damage under thermal annealing has also been studied, showing a remarkable recovery at moderate temperatures (~500 {\deg}C). This observation underscores the potential of this method for the scalable production of nanomembranes with improved reproducibility compared to conventional mechanical exfoliation techniques. Importantly, such exfoliation can be done employing different ions, providing simultaneous $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ doping, chosen to control the structural, optical, magnetic and electrical properties of the nanomembranes, thus tailoring them to fit the desired applications.</description>

      <title>Phonon-limited valley life times in single-particle bilayer graphene quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Long wavelength interdomain phonons and instability of dislocations in small-angle twisted bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for long wavelength phonons originating at dislocations separating domains in small-angle twisted homobilayers of 2D materials such as graphene and MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se). We find that both partial and perfect dislocations, forming due to lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayers with parallel and anti-parallel alignment of unit cells of the constituent layers, respectively, support several one-dimensional subbands of the {\it interdomain} phonons. We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. We argue that pinning potential and/or small deformations of the dislocations could stabilize the gapless phonon spectra. The other subbands are gapped, with subband bottoms lying below the frequency of interlayer shear mode in domains, which facilitates their detection with the help of optical and magnetotransport techniques.</description>

      <title>Zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance at the 10-9 level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of imperfect nesting in a simple 2D tight-binding model on the electronic properties in the density-wave (DW) state. The discussed model reflects the main features of quasi-1D metals, where the DW emerges. We show that an imperfect nesting leads to unusual singularities in the quasi-particle density of states, leading to a strong renormalization of the superconducting critical temperature. We also compute the conductivity tensor of the normal state and obtain a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data on rare-earth tritellurides and many other DW materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-flip Scattering at a Chiral Interface of Helical Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip scattering processes of electrons when they pass a chiral interface, which is the boundary between right- and left-handed one-dimensional chain. We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Mixed-state Topological Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superconducting pairing due to multiple Majorana edge modes in driven topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have been shown to be the simplest quasiparticles exhibiting pure odd-frequency pairing, an effect that has so far been theoretically established in the static regime. In this work, we investigate the formation of Majorana modes and odd-frequency pairing in $p$-wave spin-polarized superconductors under a time-dependent drive. We first show that the driven system hosts multiple Majorana modes emerging at zero and $\pi$, whose formation can be controlled by an appropriate tuning of the drive frequency and chemical potential, in agreement with previous studies. Then we explore the induced pair correlations and find that odd-frequency spin-polarized $s$-wave pairing is broadly induced, acquiring large values in the presence of Majorana modes. We discover that, while odd-frequency pairing is proportional to $\sim1/\omega$ in the presence of Majorana zero modes, it is proportional to $\sim 1/(\omega-\pi\hbar/T)$ in the presence of Majorana $\pi$ modes, where $T$ is the periodicity of the drive. Furthermore, we find that the amount of odd-frequency pairing becomes larger when multiple Majorana modes appear but the overall divergent profile as a function of frequency remains. We also show that the divergent odd-frequency pairing is robust against scalar disorder. Notably, we establish a spectral bulk-boundary correspondence between the amount of boundary odd-$\omega$ pairing and the bulk topological invariants in driven chiral systems, which we show to be protected by chiral symmetry and is thus robust against disorder. Our work thus paves the way for understanding the emergent pair correlations in driven topological superconductors</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19421v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. Specifically, there are a total of 26 Rashba semiconductors with isolated spin splitting bands contributed by Se/Te-pz orbitals at conduction band minimum, and their Rashba constant is closely related to the intrinsic electric field and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. As the atomic number increases, the bandgap of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) continually decreases until it shrinks to a point where, when SOC is considered, band inversion occurs and it reopens with a nontrivial topology. In conjunction with band inversion, pz orbitals near the Fermi level can introduce double Rashba splitting featuring a distinctive hybrid spin texture, which can be further effectively adjusted through small biaxial strains and show a continuous evolution of topological to non-topological accompanied by different spin textures. This work provides new insights into Rashba and topology physics and further presents indispensable inversion asymmetry materials for the development of nonlinear optoelectronics.</description>
