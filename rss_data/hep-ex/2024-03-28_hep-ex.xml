      <title>New Constraints on Exotic Spin-Spin-Velocity-Dependent Interactions with Solid-State Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new experimental results on exotic spin-spin-velocity-dependent interactions between electron spins. We designed an elaborate setup that is equipped with two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles in diamonds. One of the NV ensembles serves as the spin source, while the other functions as the spin sensor. By coherently manipulating the quantum states of two NV ensembles and their relative velocity at the micrometer scale, we are able to scrutinize exotic spin-spin-velocity-dependent interactions at short force ranges. For a T-violating interaction, $V_6$, new limits on the corresponding coupling coefficient, $f_6$, have been established for the force range shorter than 1 cm. For a P,T-violating interaction, $V_{14}$, new constraints on the corresponding coupling coefficient, $f_{14}$, have been obtained for the force range shorter than 1 km.</description>

      <title>Development and property study of the extremely thin 12 \texorpdfstring{$\mu m$} C-type straw tubes with 5-mm diameter for a Straw Tracker System of COMET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COMET experiment focuses on searching for the direct conversion of a muon into an electron with aluminum nuclei, without emitting a neutrino (so called $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion). This conversion violates charged lepton flavor conservation law, a fundamental principle in the Standard Model. The COMET experiment requirement is to achieve the muon-to-electron conversation sensitivity better than $10^{-17}$. The Straw Tracker System (STS) based on straw tubes could provide the necessary spatial resolution of 100 $\mu$m and the electron momentum resolution better than 100 MeV/c
  The COMET phase-II will operate with 56 kW 8 GeV proton beam increasing from 3.2 kW 8GeV proton beam proposed for COMET phase-I. The 10-mm straws system was developed for COMET-phase-I and wouldn't perform with full efficiency with 20 times increased intensity. New STT design based on 5-mm 12-$\mu$m thick straws could satisfy the requirement of increased intensity. This detector should also operate in vacuum with 1 bar internal pressure. The mechanical properties of these straws such as sagging, elongation, dependence of the diameter on over-pressure, etc are discussed in this article.</description>

      <title>Low radioactivity techniques for Large TPCs in rare event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of rare phenomena requires an effective suppression of all the background components entangling the expected signal. This has compelled the development of a wide range of low radioactivity techniques and background mitigation strategies. Some examples of those applied to Large Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) will be discussed here, including the operation of experiments deep underground, the exhaustive control of material radiopurity and the implementation of discrimination techniques.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Disentangling Triangle Singularity and Pole-Based Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today. In fact, a purely kinematic triangle mechanism is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements. We also identify the type of dynamic pole structure that can be misidentified as triangle enhancement. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a single triangle singularity, and the pole-based interpretation is more favored for this signal. Lastly, we argue how our method can be used as a model-selection framework to help in classifying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>

      <title>The role of hidden-color components in the tetraquark mixing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiquarks can have two-hadron components and hidden-color components in their wave functions. The presence of two-hadron components in multiquarks introduces a potential source of confusion, particularly with respect to their resemblance to hadronic molecules. On the other hand, hidden-color components are essential for distinguishing between multiquarks and hadronic molecules. In this work, we study the hidden-color components in the wave functions of the tetraquark mixing model, a model that has been proposed as a suitable framework for describing the properties of two nonets in the $J^P=0^+$ channel: the light nonet [$a_0 (980)$, $K_0^* (700)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0 (980)$] and the heavy nonet [$a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0 (1500)$]. Our analysis reveals a substantial presence of hidden-color components within the tetraquark wave functions. To elucidate the impact of hidden-color components on physical quantities, we conduct computations of the hyperfine masses, $\langle V_{CS}\rangle$, for the two nonets, considering scenarios involving only the two-meson components and those incorporating the hidden-color components. We demonstrate that the hidden-color components constitute an important part of the hyperfine masses, such that the mass difference formula, $\Delta M\approx \Delta \langle V_{CS}\rangle$, which has been successful for the two nonets, cannot be achieved without the hidden-color contributions. This can provide another evidence supporting the tetraquark nature of the two nonets.</description>

      <title>A Novel Proton Decay Signature at DUNE, JUNO, and Hyper-K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton decay, although unobserved so far, is a natural expectation when attempting to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. $p\to K^+\bar{\nu}$ or $p\to K^+\tilde{\chi}_1^0$, with $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ a light exotic neutral particle, represent possible decay channels achievable in models of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the MSSM with trilinear R-parity-violating terms, or the Standard Model extended by a heavy neutral lepton. Among the decay products of these modes, the neutral fermions would typically appear as missing energy in collider searches. The present study considers how such decay modes could be differentiated in experimental settings, as the exotic $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ may further decay if it is not protected by a symmetry (such as R-parity in the MSSM). We assess the detection prospects of the proposed experiments DUNE, JUNO and Hyper-K in this context.</description>

      <title>One flow to correct them all: improving simulations in high-energy physics with a single normalising flow and a switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulated events are key ingredients in almost all high-energy physics analyses. However, imperfections in the simulation can lead to sizeable differences between the observed data and simulated events. The effects of such mismodelling on relevant observables must be corrected either effectively via scale factors, with weights or by modifying the distributions of the observables and their correlations. We introduce a correction method that transforms one multidimensional distribution (simulation) into another one (data) using a simple architecture based on a single normalising flow with a boolean condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a physics-inspired toy dataset with non-trivial mismodelling of several observables and their correlations.</description>

      <title>Cavity Detection of Gravitational Waves: Where Do We Stand?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario, we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window. Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is dominated by coherent binary mergers.</description>

      <title>Revisit the heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the masses of heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ in the framework of the QCD sum rules. Considering the $\bar QGGQ$ operators in the $(\mathbf{8}_{[\bar{Q}Q]} \otimes \mathbf{8}_{[GG]})$ color structure, we have constructed two independent interpolating currents with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and five independent currents with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$, in which the glueball operators can be symmetric $d^{rst}G^{s}_{\mu\nu}G^{t}_{\alpha\beta}$ or antisymmetric $f^{rst}G^{s}_{\mu\nu}G^{t}_{\alpha\beta}$. For the interpolating currents with antisymmetric glueball operator $f^{rst}G^{s}_{\mu\nu}G^{t}_{\alpha\beta}$, there exist non-local divergences in one kind of additional Feynman diagrams of tri-gluon condensate, which will give important contributions to the sum rule stabilities and mass predictions. We use the diagrammatic operator renormalization to cancel out such divergences. At the leading order of $\alpha_s$, the two-point correlation functions and spectral densities can be expressed in the analytic form of the generalized hypergeometric functions and Meijer's G-functions. After performing the numerical analysis, we predict the masses of the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ charmonium double-gluon hybrid mesons to be around $6.1-7.2$ GeV and $6.3-6.4$ GeV, respectively. For the bottomonium systems, their masses are predicted to be $13.7-14.3$ GeV and $12.6-13.3$ GeV for the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ channels, respectively. Besides, it is possible to hunt for these charmonium $\bar{c}GGc$ hybrids in the radiative decays of $\Upsilon (nS)$ and $\chi_{bJ}$ mesons in BelleII experiment. Further investigations on these hybrid states in various theoretical and phenomenological methods are also anticipated in the future.</description>

      <title>Determination of impact parameter for CEE with digi-input neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15355v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact parameter characterizes the centrality in nucleus-nucleus collision geometry. The determination of impact parameters in real experiments is usually based on the reconstructed particle attributes or the derived event-level observables. For the scheduled Cooler-storage-ring External-target Experiment (CEE), the low beam energy reduces correlation between the impact parameter and charged particle multiplicity, which decreases the validity of the explicit determination methods. This work investigates a few neural network-based models that directly take the digitized signals from the external Time-of-flight detectors as input. The model with the best performance shows a mean absolute error of 0.479 fm with simulated U-U collisions at 0.5 AGeV. The performances of the models implemented with digi inputs are compared with reference models with phase space inputs, showing the capability of neural networks to handle the original but potentially interrelated digitized signal information.</description>

      <title>Searches for axion-like particles via $\gamma \gamma$ fusion at future $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opportunities for searches for axion-like particles (ALPs) coupling to photons in $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collisions at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) and International Linear Collider (ILC) are investigated. We perform a study of the photon-fusion production of ALPs decaying into two photons, $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^- \overset{\gamma \gamma}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{e}^{+}\;a(\gamma \gamma)\;\mathrm{e}^{-}$, over the light-by-light continuum background, for the planned FCC-ee and ILC center-of-mass energies and integrated luminosities. An analysis of the feasibility measurements is presented using parametrized simulations for two types of detectors. Upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the cross section for ALP production, $\sigma(\gamma \gamma \to a \to \gamma \gamma)$, and on the ALP-photon coupling are obtained over the $m_a \approx 0.1$--1000 GeV ALP mass range, and compared to current and future collider searches. Production cross sections down to $\sigma(\gamma \gamma \to a \to \gamma \gamma) \approx 1$ fb (1 ab) will be probed at $m_a\approx 1$ (300) GeV, corresponding to constraints on the axion-photon coupling as low as $g_\mathrm{a\gamma \gamma} \approx 2\cdot10^{-3}$ TeV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic pion-proton and pion-pion scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime. Taking into account the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, which are described by the Reggeized $2^{++}$ glueball and vector meson propagator respectively, the total and differential cross sections are calculated. The adjustable parameters involved in the model are determined with the experimental data of the pion-proton total cross sections. The differential cross sections can be predicted without any additional parameters, and it is shown that our predictions are consistent with the data. The energy dependence of the Pomeron and Reggeon contribution is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of the spectral excess in DAMIC at SNOLAB with skipper CCDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from a 3.25 kg-day target exposure of two silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs), each with 24 megapixels and skipper readout, deployed in the DAMIC setup at SNOLAB. With a reduction in pixel readout noise of a factor of 10 relative to the previous detector, we investigate the excess population of low-energy events in the CCD bulk previously observed above expected backgrounds. We address the dominant systematic uncertainty of the previous analysis through a depth fiducialization designed to reject surface backgrounds on the CCDs. The measured bulk ionization spectrum confirms the presence of an excess population of low-energy events in the CCD target with characteristic rate of ${\sim}7$ events per kg-day and electron-equivalent energies of ${\sim}80~$eV, whose origin remains unknown.</description>

      <title>Incoherent ${\rm J}/\psi$ production at large $|t|$ identifies the onset of saturation at the LHC</title>

Abstract: We predict that the onset of gluon saturation can be uniquely identified using incoherent ${\rm J}/\psi$ production in Pb$\unicode{x2013}$Pb collisions at currently accessible energies of the LHC. The diffractive incoherent photo-production of a ${\rm J}/\psi$ vector meson off a hadron provides information on the partonic structure of the hadron. Within the Good-Walker approach it specifically measures the variance over possible target configurations of the hadronic colour field. For this process then, gluon saturation sets in when the cross section reaches a maximum, as a function of the centre-of-mass energy of the photon-hadron system ($W$), and then decreases. We benchmark the energy-dependent hot-spot model against data from HERA and the LHC and demonstrate a good description of the available data. We show that the study of the energy dependence of the incoherent production of ${\rm J}/\psi$ allows us to pinpoint the onset of saturation effects by selecting the region of Mandelstam-$t$ around 1 GeV$^2$ where the contribution of hot spots is dominant. We predict the onset of saturation in a Pb target to occur for $W$ around a few hundred GeV. This can be measured with current data in ultra-peripheral Pb$\unicode{x2013}$Pb collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Directional detection of keV proton and carbon recoils with MIMAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directional detection is the dedicated strategy to demonstrate that DM-like signals measured by direct detectors are indeed produced by DM particles from the galactic halo. The experimental challenge of measuring the direction of DM-induced nuclear recoils with (sub-)millimeter tracks has limited, so far, the maximal directional reach to DM masses around $100~\rm{GeV}$. In this paper, we expose the MIMAC detector to three different neutron fields and we develop a method to reconstruct the direction of the neutron-induced nuclear recoils. We measure an angular resolution better than $16^\circ$ for proton recoils down to a kinetic energy of $4~\rm{keV}$ and for carbon recoils down to a kinetic energy of $5.5~\rm{keV}$. For the first time, a detector achieves the directional measurement of proton and carbon recoils with kinetic energies in the keV range without any restriction on the direction of the incoming particle. This work demonstrates that directional detection is around the corner for probing DM with masses down to $\mathcal{O}(1~\rm{GeV})$.</description>

      <title>Search for the Chiral Magnetic and Vortical Effects Using Event Shape Approaches in Au+Au Collisions at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic/vortical effect (CME/CVE) in heavy-ion collisions probe the topological sector of Quantum Chromodynamics, where P and CP symmetries are violated locally in strong interactions. However, the experimental observables for the CME/CVE are dominated by backgrounds related to elliptic flow and nonflow. We employ event shape variables to mitigate the flow background and event planes based on spectators to minimize the nonflow background. We report on the CME search in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.6, 19.6, 27, and 200 GeV, as well as the CVE search at 19.6 and 27 GeV.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised and lightly supervised learning in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the main applications of machine learning models that are not fully supervised in particle physics, i.e., clustering, anomaly detection, detector simulation, and unfolding. Unsupervised methods are ideal for anomaly detection tasks -- machine learning models can be trained on background data to identify deviations if we model the background data precisely. The learning can also be partially unsupervised when we can provide some information about the anomalies at the data level. Generative models are useful in speeding up detector simulations -- they can mimic the computationally intensive task without large resources. They can also efficiently map detector-level data to parton-level data (i.e., data unfolding). In this review, we focus on interesting ideas and connections and briefly overview the underlying techniques wherever necessary.</description>
