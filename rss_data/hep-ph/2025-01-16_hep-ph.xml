      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a concise and pedagogical introduction to Feynman diagrams. After discussing a toy model which requires only undergraduate mathematics, we focus on relativistic quantum field theory. We review the derivation of Feynman rules from the Lagrangian of the theory and we discuss modern methods to compute tree and loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $\tau$-decay: Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, I summarize the recent determinations in Ref.[1] of the QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ within the SVZ expansion using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) ${\cal R}_{10}^A(\tau)$ and $\tau$-like moments ${\cal R}_{n,A},\, {\cal R}_{n,V-A}$within stability criteria in the axial-vector (A) and V-A channels of the $\tau$- semi-hadronic decays. The factorization of the four-quark condensate is violated by a factor 6 like in the case of the $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons data. There is no exponential growth of the size of higher dimension condensates which does not favour (by duality) a significant effect of the so-called Duality Violation (DV). The extracted value of $\alpha_s$ is in good agreement with the one from $e^+e^-$ and indicates that the determination at the observed $\tau$-mass is not the optimal one and leads to an overestimate of its actual value.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations in the Three Flavor Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-flavor neutrino oscillation model describes the well-studied phenomenon of neutrinos produced in association with one charged lepton: electron, muon, or tau, and then later detected in association with a possibly different charged lepton. While somewhat surprising, the firm experimental discovery of the phenomenon in the late 1990s and early 2000s has lead to a revolution in particle physics as the nature of neutrinos has been explored with heightened vigor ever since. At the core of the phenomenon are the six neutrino oscillation parameters. These parameters are fundamental and not predicted from anything else in our model of particle physics. At the time of writing this chapter, many of them have been measured, but several key questions remain that are to be answered by neutrino oscillations themselves. These questions have motivated some of the largest and most involved particle physics experiments built to date. This chapter will develop the basics of neutrino oscillation theory and build intuition for the role of the oscillation parameters and how they are measured, as well as the important role of the matter effect in neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Inflationary scenarios beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this chapter is to explain in clear and pedagogical terms how some particle-physics models and/or mechanisms can naturally lead to inflation and how this can provide testable predictions that can help us find new physics effects. Two well-established features of theoretical particle physics are linked to an essential property of inflation, a naturally-flat inflaton potential: (1) scale invariance, broken by small quantum corrections, and (2) Goldstone's theorem. It is also illustrated how to combine several scenarios of this type to obtain a rather general particle-physics motivated inflationary setup.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric searches for axion dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves using optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit birefringence effects associated with the evolution of the polarization of light as it propagates through axion dark matter or the background of a passing gravitational wave (GW). We demonstrate that this can be described by a unified formalism, highlighting a synergy between searches for axions and high-frequency GWs. We show that by exploiting this framework, the optical cavities used by the ALPS II experiment can potentially probe axion masses in the range $m_a \sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{eV}$, offering competitive sensitivity with existing laboratory and astrophysical searches. Also building on this approach, we propose using these optical cavities to search for high-frequency GWs by measuring changes in the polarization of their laser. This makes it a promising method for exploring, in the near future, GWs with frequencies above $100$ MHz and strain sensitivities on the order of $10^{-14} \, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Such sensitivity allows the exploration of currently unconstrained parameter space, complementing other high-frequency GW experiments. This work contributes to the growing community investigating novel approaches for high-frequency GW detection.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Anomalous Dimensions in the LEFT: Dimension-Six Four-Fermion Operators in NDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the complete set of two-loop anomalous dimensions describing the mixing of four-fermion operators in the Low Energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT). The calculation is performed in Naive Dimensional Regularization with anticommuting $\gamma_5$ (the NDR scheme), and the results are given in the "JMS basis" of dimension-six operators. The derivation relies on known results for UV poles in two-loop diagrams in QCD, which are then used to derive the two-loop Anomalous Dimension Matrix (ADM) for the full set of four-fermion operators including $O(\alpha_s^2)$, $O(\alpha_s\alpha)$ and $O(\alpha^2)$ corrections. The method employed is an extension of a common approach to deal with traces containing $\gamma_5$ in NDR. Our results have been implemented in the public code DsixTools. We also discuss and provide the results in the LEFT with 5, 4 and 3 active quark flavors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss scaling properties of the elastic $pp$ cross-section both at the ISR and the LHC. We observe that the ratio of bump to dip positions of the differential cross-section $d\sigma_{\rm el}/dt$ is constant over the wide energy range. We next study the consequences of this property, including geometric scaling at the ISR and a new scaling laws at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Impact of New Physics on Momentum-Dependent Particle Widths and Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of momentum-dependent particle widths and propagators on gauge and Higgs bosons and the top quark within the Standard Model (SM) and its SMEFT extensions near thresholds. By incorporating self-energy corrections via Dyson resummation, we quantify deviations from the fixed-width approximation and assess their implications for collider observables. While effects on the Higgs boson are negligible and the $W$ boson shows percent-level deviations in reconstructed transverse mass distributions, the top quark exhibits significant sensitivity near its mass threshold. Future lepton colliders, e.g., electron-positron machines or muon colliders, can offer sensitivity to these effects, enabling constraints on SMEFT Wilson coefficients. We perform a representative case study for the precision frontier available with a staged future muon collider. Our results highlight that momentum dependencies can provide additional sensitivity at precision-era experiments, enhancing the potential for discovering new physics there.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic $B_{(s)}$ meson decays to $D_{0}^{\ast}(2300) ,D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317) , D_{s1}(2460), D_{s1}(2536), D_{1}(2420)$ and $D_{1}(2430)$ within the covariant light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the semileptonic decays of $B_{(s)}$ meson to $D_{0}^{\ast}(2300)$, $D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$, $D_{s1}(2536)$, $D_{1}(2420)$ and $D_{1}(2430)$ in the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM). We combine the helicity amplitudes via the corresponding form factors to obtain the branching ratios of the semileptonic decays $B_{(s)} \to D^{**}_{(s)}\ell \nu_\ell$ with $D^{**}_{(s)}$ referring to a P-wave exicted charmed meson $D_{0}^{\ast}(2300)$, $D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$, $D_{s1}(2536)$, $D_{1}(2420)$ or $D_{1}(2430)$ and $\ell=e, \mu, \tau$. Furthermore, we also take into account another two physical observables, namely the longitudinal polarization fraction $f_L$ and the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$. Most of our predictions are comparable to the results given by other theoretical approaches and the present available data. The branching ratios of the semileptonic decay channels $B_{s} \to D_{s1}(2460) \ell \nu_\ell$ and $B \to D_{1}(2420) \ell \nu_\ell$ are larger than those of the semileptonic decays $B_{s} \to D_{s1}(2536) \ell \nu_\ell$ and $B \to D_{1}(2430) \ell \nu_\ell$, respectively. We find that the long-standing '$1/2$ vs $3/2$ puzzle' in the decays $B^{+}\to \bar{D}_1^{(\prime)0} \ell^{\prime+}\nu_{\ell^\prime}$ $(\ell^\prime=e,\mu)$ can be solved by taking some negative mixing angle $\theta_s$ values within a range from $-30.3^\circ$ to $-24.9^\circ$, corresponding to $\theta$ of about $5^\circ\sim10.4^\circ$. While Belle collaboration updated their measurements for the decays $B^{0}\to D^{*-}_0 \ell^{\prime+}\nu_{\ell^\prime}$ with only a small upper limit $Br(B^{0}\to D^{*-}_0 \ell^{\prime+}\nu_{\ell^\prime})&lt;0.44\times10^{-3}$ obtained, which is much larger than most theoretical predictions and causes a new puzzle.</description>

      <title>Prospects of $Z'$ Portal Dark Matter in $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model is well-motivated to explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly and dark matter in previous studies. However, the latest NA64$\mu$ experiment has almost excluded all the parameter space for the muon $g-2$, which indicates that the light dark matter benchmark scenarios interpreting muon $g-2$ in previous studies are also not allowed at present. In light of many recent and future experimental results, we revisit the minimal $Z'$ portal dark matter in $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$. Focus on the phenomenology of dark matter $\chi$, we first explore the viable parameter space for the light dark matter under various tight constraints. Around the $Z'$ resonance, we find that there is still a large parameter space for $m_\chi\gtrsim10$ MeV via thermal freeze-out. On the other hand, the constraints on $Z'$ above the electroweak scale are quite loose but are less studied for dark matter. We also investigate the heavy dark matter around the TeV scale and corresponding constraints. A large part of the parameter space for dark matter is within the reach of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Scotoseesaw mechanism from a $Z_3$ symmetry of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the neutrino mass generation and the dark matter stability can be governed by the center of the QCD group, which is a $Z_3$ group. Three right-handed neutrinos $N_{1,2,3R}$ transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w,w^2$, where $w=e^{i2\pi/3}$ is the cube root of unity, and they couple to usual lepton doublets via the usual Higgs doublet $H$ and two new scalar doublets $\eta,\chi$, which transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w^2,w$, respectively. This leads to a scotoseesaw mechanism in which the seesaw and scotogenic neutrino mass generations are induced by the Majorana $N_{1R}$ mass and the Dirac $N_{2,3R}$ mass, respectively. Although the lightest of the $Z_3$ fields is stabilized, responsible for dark matter, the model lacks an explanation for relic density and/or direct detection. The issue can be solved in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge completion of the model, for which the center of the QCD group is isomorphic to $Z_3=\{1,T,T^2\}$ for $T=w^{3(B-L)}$.</description>

      <title>Are there critical aspects in the time, energy and angular distributions of SN1987A?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova neutrinos are of considerable importance for ongoing research in astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics. Existing simulations of this complex event are increasingly sophisticated, but the accuracy with which they describe the emission is unknown. The only event observed so far with neutrino telescopes, SN1987A, still plays a crucial role and deserves to be studied meticulously. With this in mind, we have undertaken a refined analysis of the observations, taking into account the knowledge gained over the past decades. In this work, we consider a new parameterised model of electron antineutrino emission and test its adequacy in describing the observed distributions of energy, time and angle. The values of the model parameters derived from the data and their uncertainty intervals are presented and their significance is discussed.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium dynamics in the quantum Brownian regime with non-abelian quantum master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quarkonium production in ultrarelativistic heavy ions collisions is one of the best probes of the QGP formed in these collisions. Resorting to accurate methods to describe the $Q\bar{Q}$ evolution in a QGP is a prerequisite for the precise interpretation of experimental data. Among these methods, the quantum master equations (QME) derived within the formalism of open quantum systems are particularly relevant. We present exact numerical solutions in a 1D setting of previously derived quantum master equations (QME) in their quantum Brownian regime. Distinctive features of the in-medium bottomonia evolution with the QME are presented; some phenomenological consequences are addressed by considering evolutions for a fixed as well as EPOS4 temperature profiles. Next, we investigate the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation (often used to describe charmonium production in URHIC) by benchmarking the corresponding evolutions on the exact solutions derived with the QME for the case of a $c\bar{c}$ pair.</description>

      <title>Form factors of light pseudoscalar mesons from the perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electromagnetic and meson-photon transition form factors of light pseudoscalar mesons from the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach. In order to include the soft transversal degree of freedom of partons inside hadrons, we introduce the intrinsic transversal momentum distributions (iTMDs), accompanying to the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) which depict the longitudinal nonperturbative dynamics of an energetic meson. The main motivations of this work are the disjointedness of electromagnetic form factors between the theoretical predictions and the experimental measurements, and the BABAR-Belle tension of pion-photon transition form factor in the large momentum transfers. Our calculation is carried out at the next-to-leading-order for the contributions from leading and subleading twist LCDAs, and leading order for the twist four contributions. For the meson-photon transition form factors, the high twist contributions are considered as the first time. The main result of this paper are (a) the iTMDs play an important role to explain the data of form factors, especially in the small and intermediate momentum transfers where the pQCD prediction is decreased sizable in the magnitude, (b) the transversal-size parameters of pion and kaon mesons associated to the valence quark state are $\beta_\pi^2 = 0.51 \pm 0.04$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $\beta_K^2 = 0.30 \pm 0.05$ GeV$^{-2}$, the chiral mass of pion meson is $m_0^\pi(1 \, {\rm GeV}) = 1.84 \pm 0.07$ GeV, (c) the meson-photon TFFs are dominated by the leading twist LCDAs, the iTMDs-improved pQCD calculations favor the Belle data of pion TFF in the intermediate and large momentum transfers, and prefer a small mixing angle between $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$, (d) impressively, the inclusion of iTMDs improves the pQCD prediction down to a few GeV$^2$ for all the form factors discussed in this paper.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-future high-intensity lasers offer prospects for the observation of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production in an overcritical field regime, where the quantum nonlinearity parameter substantially exceeds unity. This experimentally yet unexplored scenario is envisaged here to be reached via the collision of a tightly focused laser pulse with high-energy bremsstrahlung photons. We calculate the achievable number of positrons in a range of laser intensities around 10$^{23}$ W/cm$^2$ and GeV-energies of the incident bremsstrahlung-generating electron beam. We investigate under which conditions the attenuation of the $\gamma$-beam due to the production process must be taken into account. In the considered interaction regime, where the local production rate grows rather moderately with higher field intensities, it is shown that the range of mostly contributing bremsstrahlung frequencies is generally very broad. For sufficiently large values of the quantum nonlinearity parameter, an optimum domain of frequencies emerges which is located far below the spectral endpoint. Furthermore, we show that it is beneficial for achieving the optimum pair yield to increase the interaction volume by a wider laser focus at the expense of decreased field intensity.</description>

      <title>$\Xi_c(2790)^{+/0}$ and $\Xi_c(2815)^{+/0}$ radiative decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the $\Xi_c$ baryon electromagnetic decay widths within the constituent quark model formalism through an analysis of the transitions from $P-$wave states to ground states. We use the non-relativistic limit of the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic interaction on keeping all the terms up to the order $m_j^{-1}$. We calculate the electromagnetic decay widths analytically, for the first time, without any further approximation. Specifically, our theoretical results for the $\Xi_c(2790)^{+/0}$ and $\Xi_c(2815)^{+/0}$ radiative decay widths, without the introduction of any additional parameters, display a significant agreement with the recent experimental values obtained by the Belle experiment. The agreement is due to the fact that we have not introduced further approximation to simplify the calculation of the difficult convective term, unlike what was done in previous studies. Our predictions may be useful for future experiments at the Belle, BABAR, and LHC experiments.</description>

      <title>The 3D structure of the Nucleon in momentum space: TMD phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I give a brief overview of our current understanding of the internal partonic 3D structure of nucleons in momentum space. I discuss some recent extractions of transverse-momentum-dependent distributions for quarks, whose analyses in the unpolarized case are reaching a theoretical precision comparable to collinear parton distribution functions. On the contrary, gluon transverse-momentum-dependent distributions are poorly known from a phenomenological point of view. I briefly review their general properties and sketch a recent model calculation covering all (un)polarized combinations at leading twist.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting New Physics with Effective Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the absence of direct evidence for new resonances beyond the Standard Model (BSM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) so far, a complementary strategy to search for new physics in an indirect way is provided by the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). As the low-energy limit of a generic ultraviolet (UV) completion of the SM, the SMEFT provides a powerful theoretical framework to correlate deviations from the SM between different processes, offering experimental sensitivity to a plethora of SM extensions. This thesis presents a state-of-the-art SMEFT interpretation of the top, Higgs, diboson and electroweak sectors, taking into account data collected at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), the SLAC Large Detector (SLD) and the LHC. We also include the effect of the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade and demonstrate the unprecedented impact on the SMEFT parameter space of two proposed electron-positron colliders: the electron-positron Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) and the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). We present constraints both in terms of Wilson coefficients, and couplings and masses of a wide range of UV-complete models through a newly developed automatised limit-setting procedure. We further present novel methodological advances through the development of unbinned multivariate likelihoods specialised to the SMEFT that provide maximal sensitivity to new physics using classification and regression techniques from Machine Learning. Our results provide an extensive characterisation of the SMEFT parameter space as probed both by current and future colliders, providing timely input to the upcoming European Strategy for Particle Physics Update.</description>

      <title>Searches for ultralight vector and axion dark matter with KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08930v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have proposed using laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors to search for ultralight vector and axion dark matter. Vector dark matter can be probed through oscillating forces on suspended mirrors, while axion dark matter can be detected via oscillating polarization rotation of laser beams. This paper reviews these searches with the KAGRA detector in Japan, including the first vector dark matter search with KAGRA's 2020 data and installation of polarization optics for axion dark matter search during the upcoming 2025 observing run.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local methods of direct determination of the Hubble constant and $\sigma_8$ seem to conflict with the predictions made from the cosmic microwave background and $\Lambda$CDM. We propose a proof-of-concept model that models portions of the dark sector as several coupled axion-like fields, resulting in both early and late time departures from $\Lambda$CDM. We determine that the model successfully eliminates both the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, while remaining consistent with both the DESI survey and the BAO sound horizon.</description>

Abstract: We for the first time construct a three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes on a factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2')$ orientifold with discrete torsion. We can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry via the supersymmetry preserving Higgs mechanism, generate the SM fermion masses and mixings, and break the supersymmetry via gaugino condensations in the hidden sector.</description>

      <title>A lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude subtraction function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compton amplitude subtraction function is an essential component in work concerning both the proton radius puzzle and the proton-neutron mass difference. However, owing to the difficulty in determining the subtraction function, it remains a key source of uncertainty in these two contexts. Here, we use the Feynman-Hellmann method to determine this subtraction function directly from lattice QCD. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to control dominant discretisation artefacts for this calculation, eliminating a major source of systematic error. This calculation is performed for a range of hard momentum scales, and three different sets of gauge configurations for pion masses about 400 MeV. Our results show good agreement with continuum OPE expectations. As such, this work paves the way for model-independent and precise determinations of the subtraction function over a wide range of kinematics.</description>

      <title>Heavy Axions Can Disrupt $\gamma$-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be produced in the hot dense plasma of fireballs that develop in the initial stage of $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) outflows. They can transport an enormous amount of energy away from the jet by propagating out of the fireball. The photons produced by the eventual decay of such ALPs do not reach a sufficient density to re-thermalize through pair production, preventing fireball re-emergence. Thus, the production of heavy ALPs disrupts the fireball and dims GRBs, allowing bright GRB observations to strongly constrain the existence of heavy ALPs. By adding ALP interactions to existing models of GRB fireballs, we set competitive bounds on the ALP-photon coupling down to $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \sim 4 \times 10^{-12}~{\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}}$ for ALPs in the mass range of 200 MeV - 5 GeV.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections to the vector meson light front wave function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.02830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute a light front wave function for heavy vector mesons based on long distance matrix elements constrained by decay width analyses in the Non Relativistic QCD framework. Our approach provides a systematic expansion of the wave function in quark velocity. The first relativistic correction included in our calculation is found to be significant, and crucial for a good description of the HERA exclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production data. When looking at cross section ratios between nuclear and proton targets, the wave function dependence does not cancel out exactly. In particular the fully non-relativistic limit is found not to be a reliable approximation even in this ratio. The important role of the Melosh rotation to express the rest frame wave function on the light front is illustrated.</description>

Abstract: We study the coherent photoproduction of light vector mesons in Pb-Pb collisions in the framework of color dipole approach. We employ the Glauber--Gribov formalism supplemented by an effective suppression factor $R_G$ accounting for the gluon shadowing correction. We adjust the latter to reproduce the deep inelastic structure function $F_2$ (E665) and $\rho$ meson photoproduction (ALICE) data. We achieve a good description of the available data points with $R_G = 0.85$ at scale $M_\rho^2/4 = 0.15$ GeV$^2$. In addition, employing this suppression factor, we present predictions for coherent $\rho(2S)$, $\omega(1S,2S)$ and $\phi(1S,2S)$ photoproduction observables using the holographic vector meson wave functions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the impact of resonant conversions mediated by non-vanishing magnetic moments between active neutrinos and a heavy sterile neutrino on the supernova neutrino flux. We present the level-crossing scheme for such a scenario and derive the neutrino fluxes after conversion, paying particular attention to the order in which the resonances occur. We then compute the expected event rates from the neutronization burst of a future supernova at DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande to derive new constraints on the neutrino magnetic moment. With this, we find a sensitivity down to a few $10^{-15} \mu_B$ for a sterile neutrino in the $O(\rm{eV})$ mass range.</description>

      <title>T-odd Parton Distribution Functions and Azimuthal Anisotropy at High Transverse Momentum in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various azimuthal anisotropies ($v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$), at high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$), are shown to arise from the asymmetric scattering of transverse polarized quarks and gluons, arising from unpolarized nucleons (the Boer-Mulders' effect) and resulting in unpolarized hadrons (the Collins effect). Combined with the asymmetric scattering of partons from polarization independent but transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions, we obtain a possible mechanism to understand the azimuthal anisotropy of hadrons at large transverse momentum observed in $p$-$p$ collisions. Constraining the ratio of polarization dependent TMD distributions to polarization independent distributions by comparing with the data from $p$-$p$ collisions, we find that scaling the acquired transverse momentum of the initial state partons from the proton, due to prescattering before the hard interaction, with the length of the nucleus ($k_\perp^2 \propto A^{1/3}$), straightforwardly yields the azimuthal anisotropy at high $p_T$ in $p$-$A$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the LHCb measurement of the hyperon decay mode $\Sigma^+\to p\mu^+\mu^-$ and prospects for improvement, we revisit the estimates for the rate and muon forward-backward asymmetry within the standard model and beyond. The standard model prediction has a fourfold ambiguity, and we suggest ways to resolve it with other measurements, including possible studies of $\Sigma^+\to p e^+e^-$ in the BESIII and LHCb experiments. We use the recent BESIII measurements of $\Sigma^+\to p \gamma$ and $\Sigma^+\to N\pi$ to reduce the uncertainty in the long-distance contribution to $\Sigma^+\to p\mu^+\mu^-$. Beyond the standard model, we consider a general effective Hamiltonian at low energy with ten operators whose Wilson coefficients parametrize the new physics. We derive expressions for the $\Sigma^+\to p\mu^+\mu^-$ rate and the associated muon forward-backward asymmetry in terms of these coefficients. Finally, we present the constraints on these Wilson coefficients that result from both kaon and hyperon decays and emphasize their complementarity.</description>

      <title>Addressing $\gamma_5$ in Nondimensional Regularizations: A Case Study on the Bumblebee Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the subtleties of regularization schemes in four-dimensional space ($4S$), related in particular to the introduction of the $\gamma_5$ matrix. To illustrate we use a "Bumblebee" model featuring dynamically induced Lorentz symmetry violation. The analysis centers on how different regularization methods affect the solutions to the gap equation in this model. We highlight the resolution of ambiguities associated with the $\gamma_5$ matrix in ultraviolet divergent integrals by employing an enhanced Implicit Regularization (IREG) method. This method extends IREG to a quasi-four-dimensional space, $Q4S = 4S \oplus X$, drawing parallels with the consistent approach of Dimensional Reduction (DRED). Comparative analysis is conducted against results from the 't Hooft-Veltman regularization scheme, conventional IREG in strict $4S$, and sharp momentum cutoff techniques. Our results illustrate a scheme to compute $\gamma_5$ interactions in physical dimension of divergent amplitudes, confirming the approach in [1].</description>

      <title>Freezing-in Cannibal Dark Sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-Interacting Dark Matter models can successfully explain dark matter (DM) production through interactions confined within the dark sector. However, they often lack measurable experimental signals due to their secluded nature. Including a feeble interaction with the visible sector through a Higgs portal leads not only to potential detection avenues and richer thermal production dynamics, but also to a possible explanation of the initial dark sector population through the freeze-in mechanism. In this work we study, by solving the full system of coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities and temperatures of all the involved states, three scenarios of this type where the DM is: a real scalar with broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$, a complex scalar with unbroken $\mathbb{Z}_3$, and a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ scalar with an additional scalar mediator. All of these models have viable dark matter candidates in a cannibal phase while having different detection profiles. We show that cosmological bounds can be either exacerbated or evaded by changing the dark sector interactions, leading to potential signatures in long-lived particle and indirect detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Influences of non-standard interactions on PeV neutrino events with and without a $L_{\alpha}-L_{\beta}$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently reported astrophysical neutrinos events in the TeV-PeV energy range open a winder to explore new physics at energy frontiers. In this paper, we examine effects of non-standard interactions (NSIs) on the PeV neutrinos events. We consider NSIs with and without a gauge symmetry $L_{\alpha}$ - $L_{\beta}$. We find that, for typical $\mu^{\pm}$ damping and $\pi^{\pm}$ decay sources, the NSI with an extra gauge symmetry has more noticeable effects on the PeV events. Therefore, the detection of the events in the upcoming experiments could set stringent constraints on the NSI parameters in the $L_{\alpha}$ - $L_{\beta}$ symmetric case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically conformal CFL quark matter within a nonlocal chiral quark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a three-flavor nonlocal NJL model of quark matter with the scalar attractive, vector repulsive and diquark pairing interaction channels. The model is treated within the separable approximation to obtain the EoS of cold quark matter. The analysis of the high density asymptotics of the model allows us to conclude about its qualitative agreement with the perturbative QCD. Particularly, a color superconducting CFL state is found to be the ground one at high densities. The conformal limit of speed of sound and dimensionless interaction measure are also shown to be reached from below and above, respectively. The model is applied to modelling NSs within the scenario of early quark deconfinement triggered by the gravitational instability of the NS matter due to the BEC of a spin-color-flavor singlet three-diquark bound state, the light sexaquark, stable against the weak and strong decays. A conservative estimate of the sexaquark mass based on the most up-to-date results from QCD sum rules and a constituent quark model assumes an early quark deconfinement with the onset mass below $1~\rm M_\odot$. The scenario is shown to be consistent with the present observational constraints on the mass-radius relation and tidal deformability of NSs. Given the fact that the proposed model by construction exhibits an asymptotically conformal behavior, we consider the question about approximately conformal quark matter in NSs. We report a non-perturbative energy density range, which is inaccessible in NSs and where the speed of sound and dimensionless interaction measure of the CFL quark matter simultaneously attain the conformal values.</description>

      <title>Exotic Hidden-heavy Hadrons and Where to Find Them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Born-Oppenheimer potentials for QCD with light quarks include adjoint-hadron potentials that are repulsive at short distances and heavy-hadron-pair potentials that approach thresholds at large distances. The adjoint-hadron potentials must connect smoothly to the heavy-hadron-pair potentials at intermediate distances. We identify exotic hidden-heavy hadrons as bound states and resonances in adjoint-hadron potentials that cross a heavy-hadron-pair threshold and then approach it from below. This explains why many exotic hidden-charm and hidden-bottom hadrons have energies near heavy-hadron-pair thresholds. The remarkable properties of some exotic hidden-heavy mesons can be explained by fine tunings of adjoint-meson energies in QCD.</description>

      <title>Quarks to Cosmos: Particles and Plasma in Cosmological evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe in the context of the particle physics (PP) standard model (SM) `PP-SM' the understanding of the primordial properties and composition of the Universe in the temperature range $130\GeV&gt;T&gt;20\keV$. The Universe evolution is described using FLRW cosmology. We present a global view on particle content across time and describe the different evolution eras using deceleration parameter $q$. We follow the arrow of time in the expanding and cooling Universe: After the PP-SM heavies $(t, h, W, Z)$ diminish in abundance below $T\simeq 50\GeV$, the PP-SM plasma in the Universe is governed by the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon content. Once the temperature drops below $T\simeq 150\MeV$, quarks and gluons hadronize into strongly interacting matter particles. Rapid disappearance of baryonic antimatter completes at $T_\mathrm{B}=38.2\MeV$. We study the ensuing disappearance of strangeness and mesons in general. We show that the different eras defined by particle populations are barely separated from each other with abundance of muons fading out just prior to $T=\mathcal{O}(2.5)\MeV$, the era of emergence of the free-streaming neutrinos. We discuss the two relevant fundamental constants controlling the decoupling of neutrinos. We subsequently follow the primordial Universe as it passes through the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. The high density of positron antimatter disappears near $T=20.3\keV$: Nuclear reactions occur in the presence of a highly mobile and relatively strongly interacting electron-positron plasma phase. We apply plasma theory methods to describe the strong screening effects between heavy dust particle (nucleons). We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of the electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the one- and two-loop matching corrections in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) that impact electroweak precision measurements and flavour physics observables, focusing on the contributions of third-generation four-quark operators. Our results provide a crucial ingredient for a model-independent analysis of constraints on beyond the Standard Model physics that primarily affects the sector of third-generation four-quark operators. Concise analytic expressions are provided for all considered precision observables, which should facilitate their inclusion into global SMEFT analyses.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>

      <title>New physics searches via angular distributions of $ \bar{B} \to D^* (\to D \pi) \tau (\to \ell \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_\ell) \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of $\bar{B} \to D^* \tau {\bar{\nu}}_\tau$ angular distribution can be used to obtain information about new physics (or beyond the Standard Model) couplings, which are motivated by various $B$ anomalies. However, the inability to measure precisely the three-momentum of the $\tau$ lepton hinders such measurements, as the tau decay contains one or more undetected neutrinos. Here, we present a measurable angular distribution of $\bar{B} \to D^* \tau {\bar{\nu}}_\tau$ by considering the additional decay $\tau \to \ell \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_\ell$, where $\ell \in \{ e , \mu \}$. The full process used is $\bar{B} \to D^* (\to D \pi) \tau (\to \ell \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_\ell) \bar{\nu}_\tau$, in which only the $\ell$ and $D^*$ are reconstructed. A fit to the experimental angular distribution of this process can be used to extract information on new physics parameters. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we generate simulated data for this process and perform a sensitivity study to obtain the expected statistical errors on new physics parameters from experiments in the near future. We obtain a sensitivity of the order of 5% for the right-handed current and around 6% for the tensor current. In addition, we use the recent lattice QCD data on $B \to D^*$ form factors and obtain correlations between form factors and new physics parameters.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the preparation period for precision measurements in the newly planned collider experiments, the understanding of the 3D structure of hadron is becoming increasingly urgent. This triggers the activities to include elements of Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization physics in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. The method designed especially to address this need is the TMD Parton Branching (PB) method. The equivalence of the PB Sudakov form factor, both perturbative and non-perturbative, to the one of Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) is demonstrated and the recent development to increase the low-qt resummation precision of the PB Sudakov up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order by using effective soft-gluon coupling is discussed. The Collins-Soper (CS) kernel is extracted from PB Drell-Yan (DY) predictions obtained with different modelling of radiation.</description>

      <title>Probing $B^+ \to K^+$ semi-leptonic FCNC decay with new physics effects under PQCD approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the Belle II Collaboration reported the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu})=(2.3\pm0.7)\times10^{-5}$ with a significance of $3.5\sigma$, which is $2.7\sigma$ above the SM expectation. Motivated by this measurement, we calculate this decay channel at the NLO and twist-3 level using the PQCD approach. By combining the lattice QCD data and our results, we obtain form factors with improved accuracy. Using these form factors, we precisely estimate the branching ratios of $B^+ \to K^+$ semileptonic FCNC decays, including $B^+ \to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ and $B^+ \to K^+\ell^+\ell^-$. To explain the anomalies in these two processes, we introduce a leptoquark model as a new physics scenario. Using five possible types of leptoquarks, we successfully explain the latest experimental measurements, and further constraints on the leptoquarks are derived.</description>

      <title>Rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlation as a robust signal of diffusion wake induced by di-jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion wake accompanying a Mach cone is a unique feature of the medium response to jet-medium interaction inside the quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet as recently observed in $Z$-jet events of Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. In di-jet events, however, the diffusion wake of one jet usually overlaps with the medium-induced hadron enhancement of other jet with no clear signal of the diffusion wake except a reduction of the hadron enhancement, unless there is a large rapidity gap between the two jets. We propose to use the rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlations in di-jets with a finite rapidity gap relative to that without, as a robust signal of the diffusion wake. The asymmetry emerges because the diffusion wake of one jet is shifted to a finite rapidity relative to the other jet. This shift leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the rapidity region of the diffusion wake and an enhancement in the rapidity region of the other jet whose soft hadron enhancement is no longer or less reduced by the diffusion wake as in di-jets without a rapidity gap. We predict the rapidity asymmetry using both theoretical and mixed-event background subtraction for different values of the rapidity gap within the CoLBT-hydro model. Experimental measurements of this rapidity asymmetry with high statistics data on di-jets should provide more precise insights into the jet-induced diffusion wake and properties of the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Astrophysical Neutrino Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy astrophysical neutrinos, with TeV--PeV energies, offer unique insight into astrophysics and particle physics. Their incoming directions and flavor composition -- i.e., the proportion of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos in their flux -- are, individually, rewarding observables. Combined, they offer new opportunities, hitherto unexplored, that we expose for the first time. Anisotropy in the arrival directions of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos may reveal multiple populations of neutrino sources, differently distributed in the sky, and test whether neutrinos of different flavor propagate preferentially along certain directions, such as expected from breaking Lorentz invariance. Using 7.5 years of public IceCube High-Energy Starting Events, we make the first measurement of the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, constrain the presence of flavor dipoles and quadrupoles, and improve constraints on "compass asymmetries" introduced by Lorentz invariance violation. In the near future, upcoming neutrino telescopes will improve these measurements across the board.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing the gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including discovering multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) under strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

Abstract: We found new solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation describing the superposition of chromomagnetic vortices of oppositely oriented magnetic fluxes. These gauge field configurations have constant energy densities and are separated by potential barriers forming a complicated landscape. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of chromomagnetic vortices and represent a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. In the presence of an Abelian field and in a particular limit the solutions reduce to the flat connections of zero energy density and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. A possible tunnelling transition between these superfluxon flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index will wash out the CP violating $\theta$ angle to zero, dynamically restoring CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Testing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation Using Strong Gravitational Lensing Time Delays and Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive test of the cosmic distance duality relation (DDR) using a combination of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delay measurements and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. We investigate three different parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap between SGL and SNe Ia datasets, we implement an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis uniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia ($M_B$) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a Cepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+ SNe Ia dataset, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR violations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across different parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR but also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.</description>

      <title>Confronting Cold New Early Dark Energy and its Equation of State with Updated CMB, Supernovae, and BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold New Early Dark Energy (Cold NEDE) addresses the Hubble tension through a triggered vacuum phase transition in the dark sector. In this paper, we constrain a phenomenological fluid model using recent cosmic microwave background likelihoods based on Planck NPIPE data alongside baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and supernovae data from Pantheon+. Exploiting the enhanced constraining power of the datasets, we introduce and study an extended version of the NEDE fluid model in which the equation of state parameter $w_\mathrm{NEDE}$, characterizing the post-phase transition fluid, is allowed to evolve with non-vanishing derivatives ${d}w_\mathrm{NEDE}/d\ln a$ and ${d^2}w_\mathrm{NEDE}/{d}(\ln a)^2$. Our results indicate that data is compatible with a rather simple time dependence that could arise from a mixture of radiation and a stiff fluid. With the updated datasets, the base and extended models still show a significant reduction of the DMAP tension from $6.3 \sigma$ in $\Lambda$CDM down to $3.5\sigma$ with a small simultaneous reduction of the $S_8$ tension, slightly improving over recent findings for the axion-like early dark energy model. Finally, we also provide a first test of the model against new BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Replacing the previous BAO constraints in our analysis with the new ones, the tension is further reduced to $2.6 \sigma$, reaffirming the Cold NEDE model as a promising solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Modular symmetry of localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the modular symmetry of localized modes on fixed points of $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. First, we find that the localized modes with even (odd) modular weight generally have $\Delta(6n^2)$ ($\Delta'(6n^2)$) modular flavor symmetry. Moreover, when we consider an additional Ansatz, the localized modes with even (odd) modular weight generally enjoy $S_3$ ($S'_4$) modular flavor symmetry, and we show the concrete wave functions of the localized modes.</description>

      <title>Did IceCube discover Dark Matter around Blazars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of blazar jets, that explain observations of their photon spectra, typically predict too few neutrinos to be possibly seen by existing telescopes. In particular, they fall short in reproducing the first neutrino ever detected from a blazar, TXS 0506+056, by IceCube in 2017. We predict larger neutrino fluxes by using the same jet models, extended to include deep inelastic scatterings between protons within the jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around the central black holes of blazars. In this way we succeed in explaining neutrino observations of TXS 0506+056, for DM parameters allowed by all laboratory, direct and indirect searches. Our proposal will be tested by DM searches, as well as by the observation of more neutrinos from blazars. Our findings motivate to implement DM-nuclei interactions in jet models and to improve our knowledge of DM spikes around active galactic nuclei.</description>
