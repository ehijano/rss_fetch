      <title>PICOSEC-Micromegas Detector, an innovative solution for Lepton Time Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a novel gaseous detector designed for precise timing resolution in experimental measurements. It eliminates time jitter from charged particles in ionization gaps by using extreme UV Cherenkov light emitted in a crystal, detected by a Micromegas photodetector with an appropriate photocathode. The first single-channel prototype tested in 150 GeV/c muon beams achieved a timing resolution below 25 ps, a significant improvement compared to standard Micropattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs). This work explores the specifications for applying these detectors in monitored neutrino beams for the ENUBET Project. Key aspects include exploring resistive technologies, resilient photocathodes, and scalable electronics. New 7-pad resistive detectors are designed to handle the particle flux. In this paper, two potential scenarios are briefly considered: tagging electromagnetic showers with a timing resolution below 30 ps in an electromagnetic calorimeter as well as individual particles (mainly muons) with about 20 ps respectively.</description>

      <title>Primary measurement of massic activity of Am-241 by cryogenic decay energy spectrometery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for radionuclide assay that is spectroscopic with 100 % counting efficiency for alpha decay. Advancing both cryogenic decay energy spectrometry (DES) and drop-on-demand inkjet metrology, a solution of Am-241 was assayed for massic activity (Bq/g) with a relative combined standard uncertainty less than 1 %. We implement live-timed counting, spectroscopic analysis, validation by liquid scintillation (LS) counting, and confirmation of quantitative solution transfer. Experimental DES spectra are well modeled with a Monte Carlo simulation. The model was further used to simulate Pu-238 and Pu-240 impurities, calculate detection limits, and demonstrate the potential for tracer-free multi-nuclide analysis, which will be valuable for new cancer therapeutics based on decay chains, Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) containing impurities, and more widely in nuclear energy, environmental monitoring, security, and forensics.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulation of the European XFEL scintillating screens point spread function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European XFEL is equipped with scintillating screens as a profile measurement monitor. The scintillating material used is Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce). At most of the stations, the screen is positioned perpendicular to the electron beam, with scintillation observed at a backward angle. The scintillator thickness is usually 200 um, making the resolution worse in the plane with the angle, as it allows for the entire particle track within the scintillator to be seen. Besides, aberrations are introduced by the objective used. This study outlines an accurate simulation of the point spread function (PSF) caused by all distortions of the optical system and, in addition, a method to improve the screens resolution by including the PSF into a fitting function, assuming a Gaussian beam shape.</description>

      <title>Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES) mission is developing high performance clocks and links for space to test Einstein's theory of general relativity. From the International Space Station, the ACES payload will distribute a clock signal with fractional frequency stability and accuracy of 1E-16 establishing a worldwide network to compare clocks in space and on the ground. ACES will provide an absolute measurement of Einstein's gravitational redshift, it will search for time variations of fundamental constants, contribute to test topological dark matter models, and perform Standard Model Extension tests. Moreover, the ground clocks connected to the ACES network will be compared over different continents and used to measure geopotential differences at the clock locations. After solving some technical problems, the ACES flight model is now approaching its completion. System tests involving the laser-cooled Cs clock PHARAO, the active H-maser SHM and the on-board frequency comparator FCDP have measured the performance of the clock signal delivered by ACES. The ACES microwave link MWL is currently under test. The single-photon avalanche detector of the optical link ELT has been tested and will now be integrated in the ACES payload. The ACES mission concept, its scientific objectives, and the recent test results are discussed here together with the major milestones that will lead us to the ACES launch.</description>

      <title>Reweighting simulated events using machine-learning techniques in the CMS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data analyses in particle physics rely on an accurate simulation of particle collisions and a detailed simulation of detector effects to extract physics knowledge from the recorded data. Event generators together with a GEANT-based simulation of the detectors are used to produce large samples of simulated events for analysis by the LHC experiments. These simulations come at a high computational cost, where the detector simulation and reconstruction algorithms have the largest CPU demands. This article describes how machine-learning (ML) techniques are used to reweight simulated samples obtained with a given set of model parameters to samples with different parameters or samples obtained from entirely different models. The ML reweighting method avoids the need for simulating the detector response multiple times by incorporating the relevant information in a single sample through event weights. Results are presented for reweighting to model variations and higher-order calculations in simulated top quark pair production at the LHC. This ML-based reweighting is an important element of the future computing model of the CMS experiment and will facilitate precision measurements at the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Study on the static detection of ICF target based on muonic X-ray sphere encoded imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) was discovered by Chinese physicist Zhang Wenyu as early as 1947, and it can conduct non-destructive elemental analysis inside samples. Research has shown that MIXE can retain the high efficiency of direct imaging while benefiting from the low noise of pinhole imaging through encoding holes. The related technology significantly improves the counting rate while maintaining imaging quality. The sphere encoding technology effectively solves the imaging blurring caused by the tilting of the encoding system, and successfully images micrometer sized X-ray sources. This paper will combine MIXE and X-ray sphere coding imaging techniques, including ball coding and zone plates, to study the method of non-destructive deep structure imaging of ICF targets and obtaining sub element distribution. This method aims to develop a new method for ICF target detection, which is particularly important for inertial confinement fusion. At the same time, this method can be used to detect and analyze materials that are difficult to penetrate or sensitive, and is expected to solve the problem of element resolution and imaging that traditional technologies cannot overcome. It will provide new methods for the future development of multiple fields such as particle physics, material science, and X-ray optics.</description>

      <title>TCAD modeling of radiation-induced defects in 4H-SiC diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) has several advantageous properties compared to Silicon (Si) that make it an appealing detector material, such as a larger charge carrier saturation velocity, bandgap, and thermal conductivity. While the current understanding of material and model parameters suffices to simulate unirradiated 4H-SiC devices using technical computer-aided design (TCAD), configurations to accurately predict performance degradation after high levels of irradiation due to induced defects acting as traps and recombination centers do not exist. Despite increasing efforts to characterize the introduction and nature of such defects in 4H-SiC, published results are often contradictory. This work presents a bulk radiation damage model for TCAD simulations based on measurements on 50 $\mu m$ 4H-SiC pad diodes, neutron-irradiated at various fluxes ranging from $5\times 10^{14}$ $n_{eq}/cm^2$ to $1\times 10^{16}$ $n_{eq}/cm^2$. The model accurately predicts internal electric shifts, such as flattening of the detector capacitance, degradation in charge collection efficiency (CCE), and signal detection capabilities under forward bias conditions up to high bias. It further introduces the EH$_4$ defect cluster as major lifetime killer and reinforces the assumption of the EH$_{6,7}$ deep-level defect to be of donor type.</description>

      <title>Detector integration at HEPS: a systematic, efficient and high-performance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At least 25 kinds of detector-like devices need to be integrated in Phase I of the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), and the work needs to be carefully planned to maximise productivity with highly limited human resources. After a systematic analysis on the actual work involved in detector integration, a separation of concerns between collaborating groups of personnel is established to minimise the duplication of efforts. To facilitate software development for detector integration, the ADGenICam library, which abstracts repeated code in EPICS modules for cameras, is extended to support a much wider range of detectors. An increasingly considerable fraction of detectors, both inside and outside HEPS, offer performance that exceed capabilities of the areaDetector framework in EPICS. Given this background, areaDetector's limitations in performance and architecture are analysed, and a QueueIOC -based framework that overcomes these limitations is introduced. A simple, flexible ZeroMQ-based protocol is used for data transport in this framework, while RDMA transport and multi-node readout will be explored for higher data throughputs. By calling C/C++ libraries from within Python, the performance of the former and the expressiveness of the latter can coexist nicely; the expressiveness allows for much higher efficiency in the implementation and use of integration modules functionally comparable to their EPICS counterparts.</description>

      <title>A versatile framework for attitude tuning of beamlines at advanced light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aside from regular beamline experiments at light sources, the preparation steps before these experiments are also worth systematic consideration in terms of automation; a representative category in these steps is attitude tuning, which typically appears in names like beam focusing, sample alignment etc. With the goal of saving time and manpower in both writing and using in mind, a Mamba-based attitude-tuning framework is created. It supports flexible input/output ports, easy integration of diverse evaluation functions, and free selection of optimisation algorithms; with the help from Mamba's infrastructure, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can also be readily integrated. The tuning of a polycapillary lens and of an X-ray emission spectrometer are given as examples for the general use of this framework, featuring powerful command-line interfaces (CLIs) and friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow comfortable human-in-the-loop control. The tuning of a Raman spectrometer demonstrates more specialised use of the framework with customised optimisation algorithms. With similar applications in mind, our framework is estimated to be capable of fulfilling a majority of attitude-tuning needs. Also reported is a virtual-beamline mechanism based on easily customisable simulated detectors and motors, which facilitates both testing for developers and training for users.</description>
