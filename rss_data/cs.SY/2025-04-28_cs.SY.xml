      <title>Recursive Identification of Structured Systems: An Instrumental-Variable Approach Applied to Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online system identification algorithms are widely used for monitoring, diagnostics and control by continuously adapting to time-varying dynamics. Typically, these algorithms consider a model structure that lacks parsimony and offers limited physical interpretability. The objective of this paper is to develop a real-time parameter estimation algorithm aimed at identifying time-varying dynamics within an interpretable model structure. An additive model structure is adopted for this purpose, which offers enhanced parsimony and is shown to be particularly suitable for mechanical systems. The proposed approach integrates the recursive simplified refined instrumental variable method with block-coordinate descent to minimize an exponentially-weighted output error cost function. This novel recursive identification method delivers parametric continuous-time additive models and is applicable in both open-loop and closed-loop controlled systems. Its efficacy is shown using numerical simulations and is further validated using experimental data to detect the time-varying resonance dynamics of a flexible beam system. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for online and interpretable estimation for advanced monitoring and control applications.</description>

      <title>Mixed Bernstein-Fourier Approximants for Optimal Trajectory Generation with Periodic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient trajectory generation is critical for autonomous systems, yet current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors effectively, especially when equidistant time nodes are required. This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple Target Tracking Using a UAV Swarm in Maritime Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in search and rescue missions, a trend driven by technological advancements, including enhancements in automation, avionics, and the reduced cost of electronics. In this work, we introduce a collaborative model predictive control (MPC) framework aimed at addressing the joint problem of guidance and state estimation for tracking multiple castaway targets with a fleet of autonomous UAV agents. We assume that each UAV agent is equipped with a camera sensor, which has a limited sensing range and is utilized for receiving noisy observations from multiple moving castaways adrift in maritime conditions. We derive a nonlinear mixed integer programming (NMIP) -based controller that facilitates the guidance of the UAVs by generating non-myopic trajectories within a receding planning horizon. These trajectories are designed to minimize the tracking error across multiple targets by directing the UAV fleet to locations expected to yield targets measurements, thereby minimizing the uncertainty of the estimated target states. Extensive simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in tracking multiple castaways in maritime environments.</description>

      <title>Time and Frequency Domain-based Anomaly Detection in Smart Meter Data for Distribution Network Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread integration of new technologies in low-voltage distribution networks on the consumer side creates the need for distribution system operators to perform advanced real-time calculations to estimate network conditions. In recent years, data-driven models based on machine learning and big data analysis have emerged for calculation purposes, leveraging the information available in large datasets obtained from smart meters and other advanced measurement infrastructure. However, existing data-driven algorithms do not take into account the quality of data collected from smart meters. They lack built-in anomaly detection mechanisms and fail to differentiate anomalies based on whether the value or context of anomalous data instances deviates from the norm. This paper focuses on methods for detecting and mitigating the impact of anomalies on the consumption of active and reactive power datasets. It proposes an anomaly detection framework based on the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform filtering that works in both the time and frequency domain and is unaffected by point anomalies or contextual anomalies of the power consumption data. The importance of integrating anomaly detection methods is demonstrated in the analysis important for distribution networks with a high share of smart meters.</description>

      <title>Neural Incremental Input-to-State Stable Control Lyapunov Functions for Unknown Continuous-time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on synthesizing a controller that guarantees an unknown continuous-time system to be incrementally input-to-state stable ($\delta$-ISS). In this context, the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF) for the continuous-time system is introduced. Combined with the controller, the $\delta$-ISS-CLF guarantees that the system is incrementally stable. As the paper deals with unknown dynamical systems, the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF are parametrized using neural networks. The data set used to train the neural networks is generated from the state space of the system by proper sampling. Now, to give a formal guarantee that the controller makes the system incrementally stable, we develop a validity condition by having some Lipschitz continuity assumptions and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies: a scalar system with a non-affine, non-polynomial structure, a one-link manipulator system, a nonlinear Moore-Greitzer model of a jet engine, and a rotating rigid spacecraft model.</description>

      <title>Unifying Direct and Indirect Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to learn safe controllers for uncertain discrete-time linear systems under disturbances while achieving the following two crucial goals: 1) integration of different sources of information (i.e., prior information in terms of physical knowledge and posterior information in terms of streaming data), and 2) unifying direct learning with indirect learning. These goals are achieved by representing a parametrized data-driven constrained matrix zonotope form of closed-loop systems that is conformant to prior knowledge. To this end, we first leverage collected data to characterize closed-loop systems by a matrix zonotope and then show that the explainability of these closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint, which refines the matrix zonotope obtained by data to a constrained matrix zonotope. The prior knowledge is further refined by conforming it to the set of models obtained from a novel zonotope-based system identifier. The source of data used for zonotope-based system identification can be different than the one used for closed-loop representation, allowing to perform transfer learning and online adaptation to new data. The parametrized closed-loop set of systems is then leveraged to directly learn a controller that robustly imposes safety on the closed-loop system. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming to impose safety through {\lambda}-contractivity. For polytope safe sets, a primal-dual optimization is developed to formalize a linear programming optimization that certifies the set inclusion. For zonotope safe sets, the constrained zonotope set of all next states is formed, and set inclusion is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of this constrained zonotope in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set.</description>

      <title>Renewable-Colocated Green Hydrogen Production: Optimal Scheduling and Profitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal green hydrogen production and energy market participation of a renewable-colocated hydrogen producer (RCHP) that utilizes onsite renewable generation for both hydrogen production and grid services. Under deterministic and stochastic profit-maximization frameworks, we analyze RCHP's multiple market participation models and derive closed-form optimal scheduling policies that dynamically allocate renewable energy to hydrogen production and electricity export to the wholesale market. Analytical characterizations of the RCHP's operating profit and the optimal sizing of renewable and electrolyzer capacities are obtained. We use real-time renewable production and electricity price data from three independent system operators to assess the impacts of hydrogen market prices, renewable generation, and electricity prices on RCHP's profitability.</description>

      <title>Energy Security and Resilience: Reviewing Concepts and Advancing Planning Perspectives for Transforming Integrated Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent events, including the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and climate change impacts, have exposed the critical need to ensure energy security and resilience in energy systems. We review existing definitions and interrelations between energy security and resilience, conceptualising these terms in the context of energy system transformations. We introduce a classification of disturbances into shock events and slow burn processes to highlight key challenges to energy system resilience. Examples illustrate their distinct impacts on technical, economic, and environmental system performance over time. We compile relevant recourse options across resilience capacity levels and system planning horizons to address these challenges, emphasising actionable strategies for an increasingly integrated energy system. Finally, we propose policy recommendations to integrate shock events and slow burn processes into future energy system planning, enabling forward-looking decision-making and system design to analyse and mitigate potential disruptions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Network of Coupled Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear control framework for steering networks of coupled oscillators toward desired phase-locked configurations. Inspired by brain dynamics, where structured phase differences support cognitive functions, the focus is on achieving synchronization patterns beyond global coherence. The Kuramoto model, expressed in phase-difference coordinates, is used to describe the system dynamics. The control problem is formulated within the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework, enabling the design of feedback laws through state-dependent factorisation. The unconstrained control formulation serves as a principled starting point for developing more general approaches that incorporate coupling constraints and actuation limits. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust phase-locking in both heterogeneous and large-scale oscillator networks, highlighting its potential applications in neuroscience, robotics, and distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Boosting-Enabled Robust System Identification of Partially Observed LTI Systems Under Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of system identification of partially observed linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Given input-output data, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees for identifying the system parameters under general heavy-tailed noise processes. Unlike previous works that assume Gaussian or sub-Gaussian noise, we consider significantly broader noise distributions that are required to admit only up to the second moment. For this setting, we leverage tools from robust statistics to propose a novel system identification algorithm that exploits the idea of boosting. Despite the much weaker noise assumptions, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves sample complexity bounds that nearly match those derived under sub-Gaussian noise. In particular, we establish that our bounds retain a logarithmic dependence on the prescribed failure probability. Interestingly, we show that such bounds can be achieved by requiring just a finite fourth moment on the excitatory input process.</description>

      <title>Improved Dwell-times for Switched Nonlinear Systems using Memory Regression Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a switched systems approach for extending the dwell-time of an autonomous agent during GPS-denied operation by leveraging memory regressor extension (MRE) techniques. To maintain accurate trajectory tracking despite unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances, the agent periodically acquires access to GPS, allowing it to correct accumulated state estimation errors. The motivation for this work arises from the limitations of existing switched system approaches, where increasing estimation errors during GPS-denied intervals and overly conservative dwell-time conditions restrict the operational efficiency of the agent. By leveraging MRE techniques during GPS-available intervals, the developed method refines the estimates of unknown system parameters, thereby enabling longer and more reliable operation in GPS-denied environments. A Lyapunov-based switched-system stability analysis establishes that improved parameter estimates obtained through concurrent learning allow extended operation in GPS-denied intervals without compromising closed-loop system stability. Simulation results validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating dwell-time extensions and enhanced trajectory tracking performance.</description>

      <title>A Taylor Series Approach to Correction of Input Errors in Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely recognized as powerful non-parametric models for regression and classification. Traditional GP frameworks predominantly operate under the assumption that the inputs are either accurately known or subject to zero-mean noise. However, several real-world applications such as mobile sensors have imperfect localization, leading to inputs with biased errors. These biases can typically be estimated through measurements collected over time using, for example, Kalman filters. To avoid recomputation of the entire GP model when better estimates of the inputs used in the training data become available, we introduce a technique for updating a trained GP model to incorporate updated estimates of the inputs. By leveraging the differentiability of the mean and covariance functions derived from the squared exponential kernel, a second-order correction algorithm is developed to update the trained GP models. Precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of kernels enable real-time refinement of the mean and covariance predictions. The efficacy of the developed approach is demonstrated using two simulation studies, with error analyses revealing improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Voltage Stability and Control of Electrical Distribution Systems with High Penetration of Power Electronic Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems are currently undergoing a rapid paradigm change in their operation. Centralised energy production is being replaced by a number of Distributed Generation (DG) units that are placed at different locations and voltage levels in power networks. These distributed units are mostly based on renewable energy technologies, like wind turbines and photovoltaic cells and are commonly interfaced to the grid via power electronic converters. These sources reduce energy system dependency on conventional generation units based on fossil fuels. At the same time, this shift introduces technical challenges for the safe and reliable operation of electricity network since DG sources do not inherently provide the grid regulation services of conventional, centralised generation units. Moreover, the increased penetration of renewable energy sources and their converter-based interfaces is creating voltage deviation and voltage stability issues in distribution networks. These issues range from overvoltages during hours of peak renewable generation, reverse power flows and sudden voltage drops due to the variable nature of renewable energy production. All of the above jeopardise the reliable operation of the distribution networks that were not originally designed to accommodate for these effects. The objective of this thesis is to propose novel techniques for the accurate assessment of the DG impact on voltage stability in distribution net works and investigate how the control capabilities of converter-based interfaces of DG units can be harnessed to improve stability margins and overall system robustness and performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state--observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator taking probability distributions as input: a Measure Neural Mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-fieldlimit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

      <title>Terrain-Aware Kinodynamic Planning with Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices for Mobile Robot Navigation in Off-Road Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To safely traverse non-flat terrain, robots must account for the influence of terrain shape in their planned motions. Terrain-aware motion planners use an estimate of the vehicle roll and pitch as a function of pose, vehicle suspension, and ground elevation map to weigh the cost of edges in the search space. Encoding such information in a traditional two-dimensional cost map is limiting because it is unable to capture the influence of orientation on the roll and pitch estimates from sloped terrain. The research presented herein addresses this problem by encoding kinodynamic information in the edges of a recombinant motion planning search space based on the Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (EASL). This approach, which we describe as a Kinodynamic Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL), differs from the prior representation in two ways. First, this method uses a novel encoding of velocity and acceleration constraints and vehicle direction at expanded nodes in the motion planning graph. Second, this approach describes additional steps for evaluating the roll, pitch, constraints, and velocities associated with poses along each edge during search in a manner that still enables the graph to remain recombinant. Velocities are computed using an iterative bidirectional method using Eulerian integration that more accurately estimates the duration of edges that are subject to terrain-dependent velocity limits. Real-world experiments on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle were performed in a non-flat, unstructured environment. Results from 2093 planning queries from these experiments showed that KEASL provided a more efficient route than EASL in 83.72% of cases when EASL plans were adjusted to satisfy terrain-dependent velocity constraints. An analysis of relative runtimes and differences between planned routes is additionally presented.</description>

      <title>Iterative Joint Detection of Kalman Filter and Channel Decoder for Sensor-to-Controller Link in Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative joint detection algorithm of Kalman filter (KF) and channel decoder for the sensor-to-controller link of wireless networked control systems, which utilizes the prior information of control system to improve the control and communication performance. In the algorithm, we first use the KF to estimate the probability density of the control system outputs and calculate the prior probability of received signals to assist decoding. Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information can reduce the block error rate performance of communications to improve the root mean square error performance of controls.</description>

      <title>LEAM: A Prompt-only Large Language Model-enabled Antenna Modeling Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antenna modeling is a time-consuming and complex process, decreasing the speed of antenna analysis and design. In this paper, a large language model (LLM)- enabled antenna modeling method, called LEAM, is presented to address this challenge. LEAM enables automatic antenna model generation based on language descriptions via prompt input, images, descriptions from academic papers, patents, and technical reports (either one or multiple). The effectiveness of LEAM is demonstrated by three examples: a Vivaldi antenna generated from a complete user description, a slotted patch antenna generated from an incomplete user description and the operating frequency, and a monopole slotted antenna generated from images and descriptions scanned from the literature. For all the examples, correct antenna models are generated in a few minutes. The code can be accessed via https://github.com/TaoWu974/LEAM.</description>

Abstract: This extended abstract presents the design and evaluation of AgriOne, an automated unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platform for high precision sensing of soil moisture in large agricultural fields. The developed robotic system is equipped with a volumetric water content (VWC) sensor mounted on a robotic manipulator and utilizes a surface-aware data collection framework to ensure accurate measurements in heterogeneous terrains. The framework identifies and removes invalid data points where the sensor fails to penetrate the soil, ensuring data reliability. Multiple field experiments were conducted to validate the platform's performance, while the obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of the AgriOne robot in real-time data acquisition, reducing the need for permanent sensors and labor-intensive methods.</description>

      <title>Advanced Channel Decomposition Techniques in OTFS: A GSVD Approach for Multi-User Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-user downlink system for two users based on the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. The design leverages the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of the channels between the base station and the two users, applying precoding and detection matrices based on the right and left singular vectors, respectively. We derive the analytical expressions for three scenarios and present the corresponding simulation results. These results demonstrate that, in terms of bit error rate (BER), the proposed system outperforms the conventional multi-user OTFS system in two scenarios when using minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizers or precoder, both for perfect channel state information and for a scenario with channel estimation errors. In the third scenario, the design is equivalent to zero-forcing (ZF) precoding at the transmitter.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for UAV Mobility Management: A Deep Q-Network Approach for Handover Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks presents significant mobility management challenges, primarily due to frequent handovers caused by probabilistic line-of-sight conditions with multiple ground base stations (BSs). To tackle these challenges, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, particularly deep Q-networks (DQN), have been employed to optimize handover decisions dynamically. However, a major drawback of these learning-based approaches is their black-box nature, which limits interpretability in the decision-making process. This paper introduces an explainable AI (XAI) framework that incorporates Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to provide deeper insights into how various state parameters influence handover decisions in a DQN-based mobility management system. By quantifying the impact of key features such as reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), buffer status, and UAV position, our approach enhances the interpretability and reliability of RL-based handover solutions. To validate and compare our framework, we utilize real-world network performance data collected from UAV flight trials. Simulation results show that our method provides intuitive explanations for policy decisions, effectively bridging the gap between AI-driven models and human decision-makers.</description>

      <title>Boxi: Design Decisions in the Context of Algorithmic Performance for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust autonomy in mobile robots operating in complex and unstructured environments requires a multimodal sensor suite capable of capturing diverse and complementary information. However, designing such a sensor suite involves multiple critical design decisions, such as sensor selection, component placement, thermal and power limitations, compute requirements, networking, synchronization, and calibration. While the importance of these key aspects is widely recognized, they are often overlooked in academia or retained as proprietary knowledge within large corporations. To improve this situation, we present Boxi, a tightly integrated sensor payload that enables robust autonomy of robots in the wild. This paper discusses the impact of payload design decisions made to optimize algorithmic performance for downstream tasks, specifically focusing on state estimation and mapping. Boxi is equipped with a variety of sensors: two LiDARs, 10 RGB cameras including high-dynamic range, global shutter, and rolling shutter models, an RGB-D camera, 7 inertial measurement units (IMUs) of varying precision, and a dual antenna RTK GNSS system. Our analysis shows that time synchronization, calibration, and sensor modality have a crucial impact on the state estimation performance. We frame this analysis in the context of cost considerations and environment-specific challenges. We also present a mobile sensor suite `cookbook` to serve as a comprehensive guideline, highlighting generalizable key design considerations and lessons learned during the development of Boxi. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of Boxi being used in a variety of applications in real-world scenarios, contributing to robust autonomy.

      <title>Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which Al systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. This systematic approach integrates three advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for critical decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators, available on the project website.</description>

      <title>Quick Updates for the Perturbed Static Output Feedback Control Problem in Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for efficiently updating a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller in perturbed linear systems. As operating points and state-space matrices change in dynamic systems, accommodating updates to the SOF controller are necessary. Traditional methods address such changes by re-solving for the updated SOF gain, which is often \textit{(i)} computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the problem or \textit{(ii)} infeasible due the limitations of its semidefinite programming relaxations. To overcome this, we leverage the concept of \textit{minimum destabilizing real perturbation} to formulate a norm minimization problem that yields fast, reliable controller updates. This approach accommodates a variety of known perturbations, including abrupt changes, model inaccuracies, and equilibrium-dependent linearizations. We also introduce geometric metrics to quantify the proximity to instability and rigorously define stability-guaranteed regions. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. We demonstrate the results on the SOF control of mutlti-machine power networks with changing operating points, and demonstrate that the computed quick updates produce comparable solutions to the SOF ones, while requiring orders of magnitude less time.</description>

      <title>Sampled-Data Primal-Dual Gradient Dynamics in Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a versatile approach capable of accommodating diverse control requirements that holds significant promise for a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Noteworthy challenges associated with MPC include the substantial computational burden, which is sometimes considered excessive even for linear systems. Recently, a rapid computation method that guides the input toward convergence with the optimal control problem solution by employing primal-dual gradient (PDG) dynamics as a controller has been proposed for linear MPCs. However, stability has been ensured under the assumption that the controller is a continuous-time system, leading to potential instability when the controller undergoes discretization and is implemented as a sampled-data system. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time dynamical controller, incorporating specific modifications to the PDG approach, and present stability conditions relevant to the resulting sampled-data system. Additionally, we introduce an extension designed to enhance control performance, that was traded off in the original. Numerical examples substantiate that our proposed method, which can be executed in only 1 $\mu$s in a standard laptop, not only ensures stability with considering sampled-data implementation but also effectively enhances control performance.</description>

      <title>Line zonotopes: A tool for state estimation and fault diagnosis of unbounded and descriptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10239v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes new methods for set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis (AFD) of linear descriptor systems (LDS). Unlike intervals, ellipsoids, and zonotopes, constrained zonotopes (CZs) can directly incorporate linear static constraints on state variables - typical of descriptor systems - into their mathematical representation, leading to less conservative enclosures. However, for LDS that are unstable or not fully observable, a bounded representation cannot ensure a valid enclosure of the states over time. To address this limitation, we introduce line zonotopes, a new representation for unbounded sets that retains key properties of CZs, including polynomial time complexity reduction methods, while enabling the description of strips, hyperplanes, and the entire n-dimensional Euclidean space. This extension not only generalizes the use of CZs to unbounded settings but can also enhance set-based estimation and AFD in both stable and unstable scenarios. Additionally, we extend the AFD method for LDS from Rego et al. (2020) to operate over reachable tubes rather than solely on the reachable set at the final time of the considered horizon. This reduces conservatism in input separation and enables more accurate fault diagnosis based on the entire output sequence. The advantages of the proposed methods over existing CZ-based approaches are demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: The Koopman operator serves as the theoretical backbone for machine learning of dynamical control systems, where the operator is heuristically approximated by extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). In this paper, we propose SafEDMD, a novel stability- and certificate-oriented EDMD-based controller design framework. Our approach leverages a reliable surrogate model generated in a data-driven fashion in order to provide closed-loop guarantees. In particular, we establish a controller design based on semi-definite programming with guaranteed stabilization of the underlying nonlinear system. As central ingredient, we derive proportional error bounds that vanish at the origin and are tailored to control tasks. We illustrate the developed method by means of several benchmark examples and highlight the advantages over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Boundary Control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Under Intermittent Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in this paper boundary stabilization, in the L2 sense, of the perturbed Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation subject to intermittent sensing. We assume that we measure the state on a given spatial subdomain during certain time intervals, while we measure the state on the remaining spatial subdomain during the remaining time intervals. We assign a feedback law at the boundary of the spatial domain and force to zero the value of the state at the junction of the two subdomains. Throughout the study, the equation's destabilizing coefficient is assumed to be unknown and possibly space dependent but bounded. As a result, adaptive boundary controllers are designed under different assumptions on the perturbation. In particular, we guarantee input-to-state stability (ISS) when an upperbound on the perturbation's size is known. Otherwise, only global uniform ultimate boundedness (GUUB) is guaranteed. In contrast, when the state is measured at every spatial point all the time (full state measurement), convergence to an arbitrarily-small neighborhood of the origin is guaranteed, even if the perturbation's maximal size is unknown. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>On the role of the signature transform in nonlinear systems and data-driven control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classic control techniques typically rely on a model of the system's response to external inputs, which is difficult to obtain from first principles especially if the unknown dynamics are nonlinear. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting an approach based on the so-called signature transform, a tool that is still largely unexplored in data-driven control. We first show that the signature provides rigorous and practically effective features to represent and predict system trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a novel use of this tool on an output-matching problem, paving the way for signature-based, data-driven predictive control.</description>

      <title>Set-based and Dynamical Feedback-augmented Hands-off Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel set-theoretical approach to hands-off control is proposed, which focuses on spatial arguments for command limitation, rather than temporal ones. By employing dynamical feedback alongside invariant set-based constraints, actuation is employed only to drive the system's state inside a "hands-off region" of its state-space, where the plant may freely evolve in open-loop configuration. A computationally-efficient procedure with strong theoretical guarantees is devised, and its effectiveness is showcased via an intuitive practical example.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Control for Grid-Forming Converter's Stability Under Overload Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are pivotal in maintaining frequency and voltage stability in modern distribution systems. However, a critical challenge arises when these converters encounter sudden power demands that exceed their rated capacity. Although GFCs are designed to manage DC source saturation and limit excessive AC currents, their ability to ensure sufficient power delivery under such constraints remains a significant concern. Existing studies often overlook this limitation, potentially compromising system stability during high-demand scenarios. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. The proposed approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increases where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control. Peak voltage deviation observed during transient reduced to 24.14\%. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and rate of change of voltage (ROCOV), keeping both within acceptable limits. This significantly strengthens system resilience, particularly in inertia-less power networks.</description>

      <title>A Dual Perspective of Reinforcement Learning for Imposing Policy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning methods lack an inherent mechanism to impose behavioural constraints on the trained policies. Although certain extensions exist, they remain limited to specific types of constraints, such as value constraints with additional reward signals or visitation density constraints. In this work we unify these existing techniques and bridge the gap with classical optimization and control theory, using a generic primal-dual framework for value-based and actor-critic reinforcement learning methods. The obtained dual formulations turn out to be especially useful for imposing additional constraints on the learned policy, as an intrinsic relationship between such dual constraints (or regularization terms) and reward modifications in the primal is revealed. Furthermore, using this framework, we are able to introduce some novel types of constraints, allowing to impose bounds on the policy's action density or on costs associated with transitions between consecutive states and actions. From the adjusted primal-dual optimization problems, a practical algorithm is derived that supports various combinations of policy constraints that are automatically handled throughout training using trainable reward modifications. The proposed $\texttt{DualCRL}$ method is examined in more detail and evaluated under different (combinations of) constraints on two interpretable environments. The results highlight the efficacy of the method, which ultimately provides the designer of such systems with a versatile toolbox of possible policy constraints.</description>

      <title>On the Loewner framework, the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, and the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Loewner framework is an interpolatory approach for the approximation of linear and nonlinear systems. The purpose here is to extend this framework to linear parametric systems with an arbitrary number n of parameters. To achieve this, a new generalized multivariate rational function realization is proposed. Then, we introduce the n-dimensional multivariate Loewner matrices and show that they can be computed by solving a set of coupled Sylvester equations. The null space of these Loewner matrices allows the construction of the multivariate barycentric rational function. The principal result of this work is to show how the null space of the n-dimensional Loewner matrix can be computed using a sequence of 1-dimensional Loewner matrices, leading to a drastic reduction of the computational burden. Equally importantly, this burden is alleviated by avoiding the explicit construction of large-scale n-dimensional Loewner matrices of size $N \times N$. Instead, the proposed methodology achieves decoupling of variables, leading to (i) a complexity reduction from $O(N^3)$ to below $O(N^{1.5})$ when $n &gt; 5$ and (ii) to memory storage bounded by the largest variable dimension rather than their product, thus taming the curse of dimensionality and making the solution scalable to very large data sets. This decoupling of the variables leads to a result similar to the Kolmogorov superposition theorem for rational functions. Thus, making use of barycentric representations, every multivariate rational function can be computed using the composition and superposition of single-variable functions. Finally, we suggest two algorithms (one direct and one iterative) to construct, directly from data, multivariate (or parametric) realizations ensuring (approximate) interpolation. Numerical examples highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <title>Real-Time-Feasible Collision-Free Motion Planning For Ellipsoidal Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online planning of collision-free trajectories is a fundamental task for robotics and self-driving car applications. This paper revisits collision avoidance between ellipsoidal objects using differentiable constraints. Two ellipsoids do not overlap if and only if the endpoint of the vector between the center points of the ellipsoids does not lie in the interior of the Minkowski sum of the ellipsoids. This condition is formulated using a parametric over-approximation of the Minkowski sum, which can be made tight in any given direction. The resulting collision avoidance constraint is included in an optimal control problem (OCP) and evaluated in comparison to the separating-hyperplane approach. Not only do we observe that the Minkowski-sum formulation is computationally more efficient in our experiments, but also that using pre-determined over-approximation parameters based on warm-start trajectories leads to a very limited increase in suboptimality. This gives rise to a novel real-time scheme for collision-free motion planning with model predictive control (MPC). Both the real-time feasibility and the effectiveness of the constraint formulation are demonstrated in challenging real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Whole-body End-Effector Pose Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining manipulation with the mobility of legged robots is essential for a wide range of robotic applications. However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system's complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm's workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot's initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot's operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64 degrees, outperforming existing competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Optimal Control: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel operator-theoretic approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the infinitesimal generator of a controlled stochastic diffusion in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. We demonstrate that our approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problems. Furthermore, our learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Grasping Force Tracking Strategy for Nonlinear and Time-Varying Object Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate grasp force control is one of the key skills for ensuring successful and damage-free robotic grasping of objects. Although existing methods have conducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they often overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target force when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal parameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the object's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on stiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous, plastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing studies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness definition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept of generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear time-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness estimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized stiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using a PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better adaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods. The method effectively solves the problem of grasp force tracking in unknown, nonlinear, and time-varying grasp systems, demonstrating the generalization capability of our neural network and enhancing the robotic grasping ability in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Actionable World Models for Industrial Process Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process inputs and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors influencing the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.</description>
