      <title>Radiation and Heat Transport in Divergent Shock-Bubble Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock-bubble interactions (SBI) are important across a wide range of physical systems. In inertial confinement fusion, interactions between laser-driven shocks and micro-voids in both ablators and foam targets generate instabilities that are a major obstacle in achieving ignition. Experiments imaging the collapse of such voids at high energy densities (HED) are constrained by spatial and temporal resolution, making simulations a vital tool in understanding these systems. In this study, we benchmark several radiation and thermal transport models in the xRAGE hydrodynamic code against experimental images of a collapsing mesoscale void during the passage of a 300 GPa shock. We also quantitatively examine the role of transport physics in the evolution of the SBI. This allows us to understand the dynamics of the interaction at timescales shorter than experimental imaging framerates. We find that all radiation models examined reproduce empirical shock velocities within experimental error. Radiation transport is found to reduce shock pressures by providing an additional energy pathway in the ablation region, but this effect is small ($\sim$1\% of total shock pressure). Employing a flux-limited Spitzer model for heat conduction, we find that flux limiters between 0.03 and 0.10 produce agreement with experimental velocities, suggesting that the system is well-within the Spitzer regime. Higher heat conduction is found to lower temperatures in the ablated plasma and to prevent secondary shocks at the ablation front, resulting in weaker primary shocks. Finally, we confirm that the SBI-driven instabilities observed in the HED regime are baroclinically driven, as in the low energy case.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Resolution X-ray Thomson Scattering Measurements of Electronic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a novel ultrahigh resolution ($\Delta E \sim 0.1\,$eV) setup to measure electronic features in x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments at the European XFEL in Germany, we have studied the collective plasmon excitation in aluminium at ambient conditions, which we can measure very accurately even at low momentum transfers. As a result, we can resolve previously reported discrepancies between ab initio time-dependent density functional theory simulations and experimental observations. The demonstrated capability for high-resolution XRTS measurements will be a game changer for the diagnosis of experiments with matter under extreme densities, temperatures, and pressures, and unlock the full potential of state-of-the-art x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities to study planetary interior conditions, to understand inertial confinement fusion applications, and for material science and discovery.</description>

      <title>Canonical Hamiltonian Guiding Center Dynamics and Its Intrinsic Magnetic Moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of guiding center is potent in astrophysics, space plasmas, fusion researches, and arc plasmas to solve the multi-scale dynamics of magnetized plasmas. In this letter, we rigorously prove that the guiding center dynamics can generally be described as a constrained canonical Hamiltonian system with two constraints in six dimensional phase space, and that the solution flow of the guiding center lies on a canonical symplectic sub-manifold. The guiding center can thus be modeled as a pseudo-particle with an intrinsic magnetic moment, which properly replaces the charged particle dynamics on time scales larger than the gyro-period. The complete dynamical behaviors, such as the velocity and force, of the guiding center pseudo-particle can be clearly deduced from the model. Furthermore, a series of related theories, such as symplectic numerical methods, the canonical gyro-kinetic theory, and canonical particle-in-cell algorithms can be systematically developed based on the canonical guiding center system. The canonical guiding center theory also provides an enlightenment for the origin of the intrinsic magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Surface and sub-surface modifications of copper electrodes exposed to high-field conditioning at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate the dependence of conditioning and field-holding on temperature, three pairs of copper electrodes underwent high voltage conditioning with direct current (DC) pulses while kept at a single temperature, unique for each set (300~K, 30~K and 10~K), until saturation field for each set was found. The sets conditioned at cold showed a significant increase in the field holding capability, reaching fields up to 147 MV/m after tens of millions of pulses and very few breakdowns (BDs). We interpret this as an indication of the conditioning effect being due to high field pulsing rather than exposure to BDs. The effect of the warm and cold conditioning was investigated with high-resolution microscopy, characterizing the BD spots on the anode and cathode according to their morphology and with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyzing the changes in the sub-surface regions. Atypical BD spot features were found on the cryogenically conditioned cathode surfaces, with very shallow craters of a star-like shape. The number of atypical spots increased with decreased temperatures, reaching 26 and 53 percent of the total number of spots at 30~K and 10~K, respectively. A hypothesis explaining the formation of these features is also presented. The very different morphology of the anode and cathode BD spots is presented in detail that suggesting an unknown shielding mechanism that prevents the center of the anode spot from melting. These results provide important experimental input for the development of quantitative theories and models for BD initiation and inter-electrode plasma formation.</description>

      <title>A new type of stellarator divertor: the hybrid stellarator divertor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new type of stellarator divertor is found. It has features of both a nonresonant divertor (A. Punjabi and A. H. Boozer, Phys. Plasmas 27, 012503 (2020)) as well as a resonant divertor. It has the outermost confining surface with sharp edges and large islands outside the outermost surface. For this reason, we have called it hybrid divertor. This divertor can be configured by adjusting the currents in external coils which produce nonresonant perturbations. We have simulated this divertor using the method developed in (A. H. Boozer and A. Punjabi, Phys. Plasmas 25, 092520 (2018)). The simulation shows that the footprints have fixed locations on the wall and are stellarator symmetric. The magnetic field lines leave and enter the outermost surface through three magnetic turnstiles. The probability exponents of the three turnstiles are 2.1, 2.25, and 4.3. The hybrid divertor confines larger plasma volume, has higher average shear, larger footprints, lower average density of strike points, lower maximum density of strike points, and longer loss-times than the nonresonant stellarator divertor. The hybrid divertor is robust against small changes in the rotational transform and large changes in the shape parameter that controls the sharp edges on the outermost confining surface.</description>

      <title>Discretization form of the continuity condition at the polar axis, with application to the gyrokinetic simulation in a magnetic fusion torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new computational method to solve the hyperbolic (Vlasov) equation coupled to the elliptic (Poisson-like) equation at the polar axis is proposed. It is shown that the value of a scalar function at the polar axis can be predicted by its neighbouring values based on the continuity condition. This continuity condition systematically solves the pole problems including the singular factor 1/r in the hyperbolic equation and the inner boundary in the elliptic equation. The proposed method is applied to the global gyrokinetic simulation of the tokamak plasma with the magnetic axis included.</description>
