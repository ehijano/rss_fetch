      <title>Rydberg Single Photon Detection for Probing 0.1-10 meV Dark Matter with BREAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Rydberg-based single photon detector (SPD) for probing dark matter in the 0.1-10 meV mass range (20 GHz-2 THz). The Rydberg SPD absorbs photons produced and focused by the BREAD dish antenna and trades them for free, detectable electrons. At the lower end of the mass range, photons drive Rydberg-Rydberg transitions, which are read out via state-selective ionization. At higher masses, they directly ionize the Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators from Partons to Hadrons: Unveiling the Dynamics of the Strong Interactions with Archival ALEPH Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a remarkably rich theory exhibiting numerous emergent degrees of freedom, from flux tubes to hadrons. Their description in terms of the underlying quarks and gluons of the QCD Lagrangian remains a central challenge of modern physics. Colliders offer a unique opportunity to probe these phenomena experimentally: high energy partons produced from the QCD vacuum excite these emergent degrees, imprinting their dynamics in correlations in asymptotic energy flux. Decoding these correlations requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, beyond that achieved in previous measurements. Recent progress has enabled precision calculations of energy flux on charged particles alone, allowing data-theory comparisons for measurements using high resolution tracking detectors. In this Letter, we resurrect thirty-year-old data from the ALEPH tracker, and perform a high angular resolution measurement of the two-point correlation of energy flux, probing QCD over three orders of magnitude in scale in a single measurement. Our measurement unveils for the first time the full spectrum of the correlator, including light-ray quasi-particle states, flux-tube excitations, and their transitions into confined hadrons. We compare our measurement with record precision theoretical predictions, achieving percent level agreement, and revealing interesting new phenomena in the confinement transitions. More broadly, we highlight the immense potential of this newly unlocked archival data set, the so called "recycling frontier", and emphasize synergies with ongoing and future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis and CMB bounds on photophilic ALPs: a fresh look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a fresh look at the cosmological constraints on axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple predominantly to photons, focusing on lifetimes $\tau_{a} \lesssim 10^{4}\, {\rm s}$ and masses $m_a\lesssim 10\,{\rm GeV}$. We consider Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds and explore how these limits depend upon the unknown reheating temperature of the Universe, $T_{\rm reh}$. Compared with some previous studies, we account for the rare decays of these ALPs into light hadrons and show that this leads to extended constraints for several reheating temperatures. Our limits are cast in a model-independent way, and we identify regions of parameter space where these ALPs could alleviate small tensions in the determinations of $N_{\rm eff}$ and the deuterium abundance.</description>

      <title>One Loop Calculations of Rare B-decays Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare $B$-meson decays, suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) by the GIM mechanism, are sensitive probes of new physics. In particular, loop-level $b \to s$ transitions can reveal effects of heavy virtual particles such as vector-like quarks (VLQs). VLQs, which do not require electroweak symmetry breaking for mass generation, can mix with SM quarks and induce flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs). We investigate the impact of down-type iso-singlet VLQs on the rare decay $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$, a theoretically clean channel sensitive to new physics. The Belle-II collaboration recently reported a branching ratio of $[2.3 \pm 0.5] \times 10^{-5}$, significantly higher than the SM prediction of $[0.45 \pm 0.07] \times 10^{-5}$, suggesting possible new contributions. To constrain the relevant mixing parameter $U_{sb}$, we also analyze related decays such as $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B \to X_s \mu^+ \mu^-$. Incorporating VLQ effects into the effective field theory framework, we compute modified Wilson coefficients ($C_7$, $C_9$, $C_{10}$, $C_L$) and predict enhanced branching ratios for $B \to X_s \nu \bar{\nu}$ and $B \to K \nu \bar{\nu}$. $\chi^2$ contour analyses indicate that VLQs can account for observed anomalies, providing a viable and testable extension to the SM.</description>

      <title>Optimization of factorization scale in QED Drell-Yan-like processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependence of corrections due to the initial state radiation in $e^+ e^-$-annihilation processes on the choice of the factorization scale is investigated. Different prescriptions of the factorization scale choice are analyzed within the leading and next-to-leading logarithmic approximations. Comparisons with the known complete two-loop results are used to optimize the scale choice.</description>

      <title>$\omega$-meson transverse twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate semileptonic decay $D^+\to \omega \ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rule. By constructing correlation function with right-handed chiral current, the transverse twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDA) $\phi^{\perp}_{2;\omega}(x,\mu)$ dominates the contribution in TFFs. We study the properties of twist-2 LCDA $\phi^{\perp}_{2;\omega}(x,\mu)$ by constructing a light-cone harmonic oscillator model. By applying it to the TFFs, we obtained $A_1(0)=0.537^{+0.053}_{-0.053}$, $A_2(0)=0.540^{+0.068}_{-0.068}$, $V(0)=0.754^{+0.079}_{-0.079}$, and $A_0(0)=0.553^{+0.044}_{-0.043}$ at large recoil point. Two TFF ratios are $r_V=1.40^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$ and $r_2=1.01^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$. After extrapolating those TFFs to the whole physical $q^2$ region by using the simplified $z(q^2,t)$ series expansion, the ratio of longitudinal and transverse decay widths is $\Gamma_{\rm{L}}/\Gamma_{\rm{T}}=0.987^{+0.107}_{-0.121}$. Then, we get branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to \omega e^+\nu_e)=(1.84^{+0.36}_{-0.33})\times 10^{-3}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to \omega \mu^+\nu_{\mu})=(1.78^{+0.33}_{-0.30})\times 10^{-3}$, which is in good agreement with BESIII and CLEO Collaborations. Finally, we predict the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{\rm{FB}}^{\ell}$, lepton-side convexity parameter $C^{\ell}_{\rm{F}}$, longitudinal (transverse) polarization $P_{\rm{L}(\rm{T})}^{\ell}$, as well as longitudinal polarization fraction $F_{\rm{L}}^{\ell}$.</description>

      <title>Impact of Localization in Early-Universe QCD Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a phenomenological modification of the MIT bag model equation of state that incorporates quark localization arising from gluon-induced disorder in the quark-gluon plasma. This model effectively reduces the quark degrees of freedom encoded in the product of the disorder activation function $G(W)$ and the localization efficiency factor $H(T)$\,. As a result, the critical temperature is increased roughly by 7\%\,. Employing the Friedmann equation, we find that the onset of the phase transition occurs earlier. Consequently, the mixed phase duration is only $8.22\, \mu s$, which is 24\% shorter than the bag model, and the hadronic phase cools faster. The Stephan-Boltzmann constant is reached at much higher temperatures, causing the energy density and pressure curves of the bag model to shift downward and yielding better agreement with the lattice QCD data from the HotQCD collaboration. Our results show that the localization of quarks plays a significant role in the cooling dynamics of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Empirical Reconstruction of the JSNS$^2$ KDAR $\nu_\mu$-$^{12}$C Missing-Energy Spectrum with a Two-Ex-Gaussian and Generalized-Tail Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses of the JSNS$^2$ monoenergetic $\nu_\mu$ scattering on $^{12}$C at 235.5~MeV have compared the measured missing-energy spectrum with several nuclear models, including \textsc{NuWro}, \textsc{GiBUU}, and RMF+Achilles. While these models reproduce the overall peak position, their respective $\chi^2$ values of $35.5$, $176.8$, and $58.1$ indicate that none can simultaneously describe the spectral width and the high-energy tail, reflecting limitations in the treatment of binding energy, two-particle--two-hole (2p--2h) excitations, and final-state interactions (FSI). To address these discrepancies, we introduce an empirical yet physically motivated representation of the spectrum based on two exponentially modified Gaussian (ex-Gaussian) components for p- and s-shell knockout and a generalized power--exponential continuum term describing multinucleon and FSI-induced strength. The fit reproduces the JSNS$^2$ data within the fitted energy range with $\chi^2=8.0$ for 6 degrees of freedom. yielding parameters that quantify asymmetric broadening of the s-shell while preserving a narrow quasielastic p-shell response. This compact model demonstrates that a minimal empirical framework can capture key features of the nuclear response and provides a useful reference for phenomenological comparisons and future studies of quasielastic and 2p--2h dynamics in the few-hundred-MeV regime.</description>

      <title>Implications of portal vector-like lepton on associated Higgs production at a multi-TeV muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have explored a portal vector-like lepton (pVLL) extension of the Standard Model (SM) and studied its implications for Higgs and vector-boson associated production ($hV$, with $~V = Z$-boson or dark photon) at a future muon collider facility. We show that while the $~\mu^+ \mu^- \to hZ~$ production rate remains close to its SM prediction in a wide range of parameter space, the rate for $~\mu^+ \mu^- \to h\gamma_d~$ can be substantially enhanced owing to the non-decoupling nature of the interaction involving the heavy lepton, the muon and the dark photon. We demonstrate that the $h\gamma_d$ production rate can exceed the corresponding $hZ$ rate by a factor of $1$-$100$ within the perturbative unitarity limit, making it a promising channel for probing Higgs interactions and potential new physics effects.
  Furthermore, this process can also be used to constrain the dark photon mass ($m_{\gamma_d}$) and/or the dark gauge coupling ($g_d$) within the pVLL framework. We perform a detailed collider analysis of the $h\gamma_d$ process in the $b\bar{b}~+$ missing energy final state. A $2\sigma$ exclusion limit for $m_{\gamma_d}$ up to $75$ GeV is obtained assuming $~g_d=0.05$, $~\sin\theta_L=4\times10^{-5}$, $~\sin\theta_s=0.05$, and heavy lepton mass $\gtrsim 2$ TeV at a $3$ TeV muon collider with an integrated luminosity of $1$ ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Tau neutrino as a probe of charged non-standard interactions at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the influence of charged-current non-standard interactions (CC-NSI) at a DUNE-like experiment. We are particularly interested in the tau neutrino channel accessible at DUNE, given the higher energy neutrino flux expected to be achieved by the experiment. We focus on CC-NSI that may affect the pion decay, the primary source of neutrinos for DUNE. We show that the expected sensitivity at the near detector may supersede the present bounds coming directly from pion decay by one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Constraints on active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moments from low-energy electronic recoils at direct detection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can potentially be produced through neutrino transition magnetic moments in neutrino-electron scattering. In this work, we probe such interactions for sterile neutrinos in the low-mass regime using low-energy electronic recoil data from direct detection experiments. We derive robust constraints on the active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moments, scrutinizing PandaX-4T and XENONnT recent datasets. Detailed statistical analyses are performed, providing exclusion limits at both one and two degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that, as we can distinguish neutrino flavors, direct detection experiments offer a unique framework for studying all possible neutrino flavors. The obtained limits are in agreement with existing results in the literature and extend the sensitivity to previously unexplored regions of the parameter space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our predictions for the Lorentz scalar mass shifts of two-flavored heavy mesons, $B_c^{(*)}, B_s^{(*)}$ and $D_s^{(*)}$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The in-medium mass shifts are estimated by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies of the mesons based on a flavor-SU(5) effective Lagrangian approach. In-medium properties necessary for the estimates are calculated by the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The enhanced self-energies of the mesons in symmetric nuclear matter relative to those in free space, yield the negative mass shifts of these mesons.</description>

      <title>Probing Short-Distance Modifications of Gravity via Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent Effects in Muonic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision spectroscopy of muonic atoms provides a powerful probe for new short-range interactions predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this work, we derive new constraints on both spin-independent and spin-dependent non-Newtonian gravity by leveraging the outstanding sensitivity of these systems. For spin-independent Yukawa-type forces, we analyze two complementary approaches: the $2S-2P$ Lamb shift in the muonic helium-4 ion and the deuteron-proton squared charge radii difference obtained from the muonic hydrogen-deuterium isotope shift. The found constraints have reached a competitive level at sub-picometer scales, with the isotope shift method yielding the most stringent bounds for interaction ranges $\lambda \lesssim10^{-13}\text{m}$. For spin-dependent effects, we analyze the influence of the gravitational spin-orbit coupling on the $2P_{3/2}-2P_{1/2}$ fine-structure splitting in muonic helium, establishing new limits on Post-Newtonian parameters. These bounds are shown to be more restrictive than those from other leading experimental techniques for ranges $\lambda \lesssim10^{-10}\text{m}$. Our findings highlight the widespread usefulness of muonic atoms in exploring new fundamental physics at short-distance scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present predictions for centrality-dependent charged-hadron production in p-O collisions at top LHC energies based on a nonequilibrium-statistical relativistic diffusion model. Colour-glass condensate initial conditions are used in a three-sources momentum-space model for gluon-gluon, quark-gluon and gluon-quark sources. Our results are to be compared with forthcoming Run3 pseudorapidity distributions for sqrt(s_NN)=9.618 TeV p-O collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the complete process of using space-based gravitational wave detectors to measure properties of the stochastic gravitational wave background resulting from a first order electroweak phase transition, to infer the parameters governing the phase transition dynamics as well as that of the underlying particle physics model, and eventually to make predictions for important physical observables such as the Higgs cubic and quartic self-couplings which are difficult to measure at colliders. This pipeline is based on a frequency domain simulation of the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, taking into account dominant instrumental noises and astrophysical background, where the data analysis is carried out using both the Fisher information matrix and Bayesian inference with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo numerical sampling. We have applied this framework to the simplest extension of the Standard Model, the singlet extension, and show the measured uncertainties of the parameters at various levels of inference, and show that the Higgs cubic and also the quartic coupling can be highly constrained from gravitational wave measurement. We also show the impact from the problem of parameter degeneracy, highlighting the corresponding limitation on parameter inference and on making predictions.</description>

      <title>Dimuon production in DIS with charm-mass effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimuon production in neutrino-nucleus collisions, an important constraint of strangeness in global parton distribution function analyses, is typically calculated by assuming it to be proportional to inclusive charm production. This approach breaks down beyond fixed-flavor leading-order calculations. In our previous work, we introduced an alternative approach based on semi-inclusive charmed-hadron production to compute dimuon production directly. We now present an extension to this work, where we compute the semi-inclusive hadron production in the SACOT-$\chi$ general-mass variable-flavor number scheme to take all charm-mass effects consistently into account. The results are in line with our expectations, with the dynamical charm-mass effects modifying our previous approximative calculation by up to $20 \, \%$ at small values of $Q^2$.</description>

      <title>An improved imaging technique to analyze the tail of the pion emission source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous imaging techniques have shown that pion-emitting sources produced at RHIC exhibit a prominent non-Gaussian tail,which may be attributed to the analysis being performed in the center-of-mass frame of the pion pair (CMFP) rather than the source frame (CMFS).To eliminate this frame-dependent effect, we propose an improved imaging technique that operates directly in the CMFS. Unlike conventional methods that rely on selecting pion pairs based on energy differences in CMFP, our technique performs the analysis in a single CMFS frame, eliminating the need to reconstruct source parameters from multiple CMFP frames.This approach reduces kinematic correlations and provides a more physically consistent imaging result. We validate our method by comparing the imaging results with real source functions extracted from models, demonstrating a significant reduction in the non-Gaussian tail and a closer match to the model's source morphology.</description>

      <title>U-spin symmetry energy and hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining the (u,d) I-spin doublets or (d,s) U-spin doublets, the SU(3) flavor symmetry of light quarks can be decomposed into SU(2)$_I\times$U(1)$_Y$ or SU(2)$_U\times$U(1)$_Q$ subgroups, which have been widely adopted to categorize hadrons and their decay properties. The I-spin counterpart for the interactions among nucleons has been extensively investigated, i.e., the nuclear symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, which characterizes the variation of binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio in a nuclear system. In this work, we propose U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ for hyperonic matter to characterize the variation of the binding energy with the inclusion of hyperons. In particular, being the lightest hyperon, $\Lambda$ hyperons are included in dense matter, where the U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is fixed according to state-of-the-art constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysical observations using Bayesian inference approach. It is found that $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is much smaller than that of $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, indicating much stronger proton-neutron attraction than that of nucleon-hyperon pairs. Consequently, $\Lambda$ hyperon potential increases significantly and becomes repulsive at large density, where there is more than 80\% probability that $\Lambda$ hyperons do not emerge in neutron stars. For those undergoing emergence within neutron stars, the onset density of $\Lambda$ hyperons $n_\mathrm{b}^\Lambda$ is typically larger than $\sim$0.8 fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to neutron stars more massive than 1.7 $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian constraint of the initial condition for the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Bayesian inference to constrain the parameters describing the initial amplitude input to the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation at next-to-leading order accuracy against precise HERA total inclusive cross section and heavy quark data. The datasets are found to provide stringent constraints and, with consistent NLO treatment, a successful description of the data is obtained. The posterior distributions define the theoretical uncertainites that surround the non-perturbative initial condition and, thus, provide a way to propagate said uncertainties to CGC calculations at NLO.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave from graviton bremsstrahlung in inflaton decay into massive spin 3/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of primordial gravitational waves would offer a direct evidence of inflation and valuable insights into the dynamics of the early universe. During post-inflation reheating period, when the inflaton coherently oscillates at the bottom of its potential, primordial stochastic gravitational waves may be sourced by its perturbative decay into particles of different spins. Assuming the behavior of the potential near the minimum as a polynomial $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$, where $k\ge 2$, and treating the inflaton as coherently oscillating classical field, we calculate the decay of inflaton into a pair of spin $3/2$ particles accompanied by graviton emission. We numerically study the reheating dynamics and calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectra. Our analysis shows that the gravitational wave spectra can offer insights into the microscopic physics during inflation.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of solar chameleons with electron recoil data from XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reassess prospects for direct detection of solar chameleons, in light of recent progress in modeling their production, and the availability of new XENONnT data. We show that the contribution from Primakoff production in the electric fields of electrons and ions dominates the electron recoil event rate, which is enhanced compared to earlier estimates based on magnetic conversion in the tachocline alone. We argue that the signal is governed by the effective coupling $\beta_{\text{eff}} \equiv \beta_{\gamma}M_e^{-4}$, which encodes the combined effects of production and detection, where $\beta_{\gamma}$ and $M_e$ are the chameleon-photon (conformal) coupling and chameleon-electron disformal coupling scale, respectively. Setting the height of the chameleon potential to the dark energy (DE) scale $\Lambda \simeq 2.4\,{\text{meV}}$, we show that XENONnT electron recoil data set the upper limit $\log_{10}\beta_{\text{eff}}&lt;-6.9$. This limit is independent of the conformal matter coupling $\beta_m$ and index $n$, and applies to the whole class of inverse power-law chameleons, well beyond the $n=1$ case usually studied. We comment on how future multi-target experiments and lower-threshold analyses could distinguish solar chameleons from other light (pseudo)scalar particles such as axions. Our work demonstrates that existing dark matter direct detection experiments can probe regions of parameter space relevant to screened DE models, providing complementary tests to astrophysical and fifth-force searches at no additional experimental cost.</description>

      <title>Light Scalars in Light of UV/IR Mixing: Classicalization via Synergy between Vainshtein &amp; Chameleon Screenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories featuring light scalar fields play a pivotal role in addressing fundamental questions in (astro)particle physics and cosmology. However, such theories often confront hierarchy problems in the absence of a symmetry. Self-completion via classicalization offers a non-Wilsonian approach to ultraviolet (UV) completion, wherein new scalar self-interactions involving derivatives give rise to Vainshtein-like screening around energy-momentum sources. Rather than introducing new UV degrees of freedom to restore unitarity at high energies, these theories reshuffle their infrared (IR) degrees of freedom by generating extended semi-classical objects -- referred to as classicalons -- which decay into a multitude of soft particles. This mechanism incorporates non-localizable fields, thereby realizing a form of UV/IR mixing that is analogous to the dynamics of black holes in gravitational theories. In this article, having reviewed the fundamental principles of classicalization with a simple k-essence model, we then argue the necessity of maintaining a little hierarchy between the scalar mass and the scale of the first new resonances, thereby illustrating the impact of UV/IR mixing on hierarchy problems. Additionally, we investigate the effects of a scalar potential and couplings to fermions on the Vainshtein screening mechanism. We discuss that a chameleon-like screening mechanism must accompany the Vainshtein screening to preserve the integrity of classicalon solutions.</description>

      <title>Form of axion in DFSZ models with $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Form of axion state in the DFSZ model is determined by exacted diagonalizing of the mass mixing matrix of $CP$-odd sector. After applying $PQ$ mechanism to determine $PQ$ charges of particles of the model, these $PQ$ charges are used to define the general form of axion. Both of these two methods give consistent and reasonable physical state of axion. The constraint of $PQ$ charge in $DFSZ - I$ model is also pointed out. Then, anomalous couplings of axion-photon-photon is re-examined. Triple-couplings of axion with two fermions are studied. The decay of and axion into a pair of photon is also considered via re-normalizable interactions arising from kinetic terms of scalar fields.</description>

      <title>The double copy effective action: a quantum (chromodynamics) approach to space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Lagrangian formulations of gauge and gravity theories emphasize compactness and off-shell symmetry. This often obscures the structure of on-shell physical observables. In this work, we present a constructive framework that elevates gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes to the defining data for quantum field theory actions, including effective field theories. Focusing on double-copy theories, we promote color-dual amplitude numerators to quantum operators. This enables the systematic identification of novel local operator content at each multiplicity and the construction of double-copy-compatible actions. By applying this framework to the well-established double-copy relationship between Einstein gravity and Yang-Mills theory, which holds for all-multiplicity tree-level amplitudes, we demonstrate a systematic path to constructing the operator expansion of $\sqrt{-g}R$ from factorized gauge-theory components. This clarifies how gravitational interactions can be understood as emerging from simpler gauge-theoretic structures at the action level. This formalism extends color-kinematics duality from amplitude data to operator constructions, naturally realizing the double copy at the level of actions and asymptotic quantum states. We illustrate the method with Yang-Mills theory, Einstein gravity, and its application to generating higher-derivative operators inspired by Z-theory and open superstring amplitudes. This work provides a concrete bridge between structured amplitudes and effective actions, offering a physically grounded alternative to traditional EFT basis-building. It reveals at the operator level deep structural connections between gauge theory and gravity (connections long recognized in scattering amplitudes) from fundamental interactions to their quantum state descriptions and higher-derivative extensions.</description>

      <title>Axionlike particle searches in short-baseline liquid scintillator neutrino detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments using large organic liquid scintillator detectors provide an experimentally rich environment for precise neutrino physics. Neutrino detection is done through inverse beta decay and relies on prompt and delayed signals, which enable powerful background discrimination. In addition to their neutrino program, they offer an ideal experimental environment for other physics searches. Here we discuss the case of axionlike particles (ALPs) produced by either Primakoff-like or Compton-like processes. Their detection relies on the corresponding inverse processes, axio-electric absorption and ALP decays to photon or electron pairs. Assuming experimental parameter values broadly representative of JUNO-TAO or CLOUD we show that scattering ALP processes involve a prompt photon signal component followed by a delayed photon signal about 5 ns after. We point out that if these signals can be resolved, this might allow for efficient ALP signal discrimination against radioactive background. Likewise, coincident events from ALP decays and scintillation light followed by Auger electrons from axio-electric absorption might as well allow for background discrimination. We determine sensitivities in both the nuclear and electron channels using as a benchmark case an experimental setup resembling that of the CLOUD or JUNO-TAO detectors. Our findings demonstrate that with efficient background discrimination these type of technology has the capability to test regions in parameter space not yet explored. In particular, the cosmological triangle can be fully tested and regions of MeV ALP masses with ALP-electron couplings of the order of $10^{-8}$ can be entirely explored.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Blindness in Baryon Number Violating Processes: Free-Beam and Intranuclear Paths to Neutron-Antineutron Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental searches for neutron--antineutron ($n \rightarrow \bar n$) transitions can be considered via two approaches: conversion in free-neutron beams and intranuclear transformation leading to matter instability in large-mass detectors. Plans for next-generation searches make it timely to highlight the complementarity, necessity, and limitations of each method. Converting the bound neutron limit into one for free neutrons traditionally utilizes nucleus-specific estimates of the in-medium suppression of $n \rightarrow \bar n$, obtained within mean-field theory under a single-operator assumption. This paper highlights how this suppression can be scenario-dependent, which can lead to deviations from the standard approach that can span several orders of magnitude. A further goal of the paper is to point out the need for a broader phenomenology program for $n\rightarrow \bar{n}$ that is akin to those developed for electric dipole moments and other systems for which short-distance new physics must be studied in-medium.</description>

      <title>Constraining memory-burdened primordial black holes with graviton-photon conversion and binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memory-burden effect stabilizes the evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) before its complete decay. This also suppresses the evaporation flux via the entropy factor to the $k$-th power and circumvents severely astrophysical and cosmological constraints, such that it opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter lighter than $10^{15}$ g which has entered the memory-burden phase in the present epoch. In this study, we propose two scenarios to probe PBHs in the earlier semiclassical phase that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. The first scenario considers gravitons, emitted semiclassically from PBHs, propagating across the recombination epoch, then the magnetic field in the cosmological filaments converts them into photons via the Gertsenshtein effect. The second scenario relies on the PBHs mergers today, reproducing young semiclassical black holes with unsuppressed evaporation. We perform computations of the extragalactic photon spectrum from PBHs emission according to these scenarios. The upper limits on the fractional abundance of PBH are obtained by comparing with the sensitivities of gamma-ray observations. The graviton-photon conversion scenario excludes the mass window $7.5\times 10^5\,{\rm g} \leq M_{\rm PBH}\leq 4.4\times 10^7\,{\rm g}$ with $f_{\rm PBH}\geq 1$ and $k=1$. Meanwhile, the merging scenario, which is insensitive on $k$, restricts PBH Dark Matter lighter than $2.2\times 10^{11}$ g.</description>

      <title>First non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment using a novel method based on the rate of change of a supercurrent first proposed in 2016~\cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1604.02152} and fleshed out in this current paper. The theory, experimental concept and implementation are described in detail. The non-zero nuclear electric dipole moment measured with over 1000 hours of data was that of $^{181}$Ta producing a best value $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm0.31_\text{stat})\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}$ and $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm3.18)\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}&gt;0$ at 99.985\%CL. There is an uncertainty on the value of overall multiplicative parameters such as the self-inductance of the superconducting circuit ($\pm4\%$), the mutual inductance between the SQUID pickup coil and the sample wire ($\pm15\%$), and the magnitude of the solenoid current ($\pm5\%$). An upper-limit was estimated for the control element, $^{207}$Pb, $|d_\text{e}^\text{Pb}|\lesssim1.2\cdot10^{-31}e\cdot\text{cm}$ at 95\%CL.</description>

      <title>Every Wrinkle Carries A Memory: An Integro-differential Bootstrap for Features in Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological observations, we push the cosmological bootstrap program beyond the de Sitter invariance lamppost by considering correlators that explicitly break scale invariance, thereby exhibiting primordial features. For exchange processes involving heavy fields with time-dependent masses and sound speeds, we demonstrate that locality in the bulk implies a set of integro-differential equations for correlators on the boundary. These scale-breaking boundary equations come with a built-in memory kernel in momentum-kinematic space encapsulating the universe's evolution during inflation. Specialising to heavy fields with sinusoidal masses such as those found in axion monodromy scenarios, we show that a powerful synthesis of microcausality and analyticity allows an analytical solution of these equations at leading order in the amplitude of mass oscillations. Meanwhile, we also unveil non-perturbative information in the integro-differential equations by resumming apparent infrared divergences as parametric resonances. In addition, we provide a first-of-its-kind example of numerical bootstrap that directly maps out the solution space of such boundary equations. Finally, we compute the bispectrum and uncover, in the squeezed limit, a scale-breaking cosmological collider signal, whose amplitude can be exponentially enhanced (with respect to the Boltzmann suppression) due to particle production triggered by high-frequency mass oscillations.</description>

      <title>Hadronic scattering in (1+1)D SU(2) lattice gauge theory from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson--meson, meson--baryon, and baryon--baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>An effective field theory for thermal QCD with 2+1 flavours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We write a long-distance effective field theory (EFT) for QCD at finite temperature just below the crossover temperature $T_c$. The low energy constants (LECs) of this EFT are obtained from lattice measurements of the screening mass of pions at two temperatures for $N_f=2+1$ using lattice results obtained at physical values of pion and Kaon masses, and $N_f=2$ where the lattice simulations were performed with a heavier pion mass. The EFT gives good predictions for other static pion properties for $N_f=2$, where lattice results are available. We show the corresponding predictions for $N_f=2+1$, where they are not yet measured. We demonstrate that EFT gives excellent predictions for the phase diagram in $N_f=2+1$. The predictions for the pressure are investigated, and predictions are also given for a Wick-rotated real-time quantity called the kinetic mass.</description>

      <title>Single-Point Search for eV-scale Axion-like particles with Variable-Angle Three-Beam Stimulated Resonant Photon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a laboratory search for axion-like particles (ALPs) in the eV-mass range using a variable-angle three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider. The scheme independently focuses and collides three laser beams, providing a cosmology- and astrophysics-independent test. By varying the angles of incidence, the center-of-mass energy can be scanned continuously across the eV range. In this work, we operated the collider in a vacuum chamber at a large-angle configuration, verified the spacetime overlap of the three short pulses, and performed a first search centered at $m_a\simeq 2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. No excess was observed. We thus set a $95\%$ C.L.\ upper limit on the pseudoscalar two-photon coupling, with a minimum sensitivity of $g/M\simeq 4.0\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at $m_a=2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. This provides the first model-independent upper limit on the coupling that reaches the KSVZ benchmark in the eV regime and demonstrates the feasibility of eV-scale mass scans in the near future.</description>

      <title>Implication of multimessenger observations on the relativistic mean-field equation of state of dense nuclear matter and skin thickness of nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition and properties of infinite nuclear matter under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure remain incompletely understood. In this work, we constrain the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter - constructed within the framework of the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model - by combining results from chiral effective field theory and multimessenger observations of neutron stars. Using the saturation properties of nuclear matter, we generate a wide ensemble of EoS, which are subsequently constrained within a Bayesian framework. The resulting posterior distributions provide tight bounds on both the saturation parameters and the coupling constants of the RMF model. Our results indicate that the GW170817 event and the latest NICER observation favor a relatively soft EoS, leading to lower crust-core transition densities and thinner neutron star crusts. The radius of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star is tightly constrained to $12.508_{-0.241}^{+0.257}$ km, while the maximum mass reaches $2.174_{-0.123}^{+0.174}\,M_\odot$. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the $\omega$-$\rho$ coupling, which governs the density dependence of the symmetry energy, becomes increasingly significant under successive astrophysical constraints. Finally, the predicted neutron skin thickness of $^{48}$Ca agrees well with the CREX measurement, whereas that of $^{208}$Pb remains in tension with PREX-II. In contrast to earlier studies, we do not observe a clear correlation between the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb and the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$.</description>

      <title>High-order cumulants and correlation functions near the critical point from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of particle number fluctuations in the crossover region near the critical endpoint of a first-order phase transition using molecular dynamics simulations of the classical Lennard-Jones fluid. We extend our prior studies to third- and fourth-order cumulants in both coordinate- and momentum-space acceptances and integrated correlation functions (factorial cumulants). We find that, even near the critical point, non-Gaussian cumulants equilibrate on time scales comparable to those of the second-order cumulants, but show stronger finite-size effects. The presence of interactions and of the critical point leads to strong deviations of the cumulants from the ideal-gas baseline in coordinate space; these deviations are expected to persist in momentum space in the presence of collective expansion. In particular, the kurtosis becomes strongly negative, $\kappa \sigma^2 \ll -1$, on the crossover side of the critical point. However, this signal is significantly diluted once an efficiency cut used to distinguish protons from baryons is applied, leading to $|\kappa \sigma^2| \lesssim 1$ even in the presence of the critical point. We discuss our results in the context of ongoing measurements of proton number cumulants in heavy-ion collisions in RHIC-BES-II.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the suppression in the lensing power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) caused by massive neutrinos can be mimicked by dark matter-baryon interactions at the precision of next-generation CMB experiments. Thus, a determination of neutrino masses from the CMB lensing power spectrum may be compromised. We illustrate the degeneracy for a dark matter-proton cross section $\propto v^{-4}$, which arises in the $t$-channel exchange of an ultralight mediator in the nonrelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Can we identify primordial black holes? The role of subsolar gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of a subsolar object in a compact binary merger is regarded as one of the most compelling signatures of a population of primordial black holes (PBHs). We critically examine whether such systems can be distinguished from stellar binaries, such as those composed of neutron stars (NSs), which could also populate the subsolar mass range. Unlike PBHs, the gravitational-wave signal from stellar binaries is affected by tidal effects, which increase by several orders of magnitude as the mass decreases. We forecast the capability of current and future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors to constrain tidal effects in putative subsolar binaries. We also discuss the broader implications that the detection of a subsolar merger would have for both cosmology and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Black holes in a dense infinite medium: a toy-model regularizing the Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the dynamics of a black hole accreting energy from a surrounding homogeneous and infinite space. We argue for a simple heuristic modification of the Schwarzschild approximation when the density of the medium is not negligible anymore. The resulting behavior is drastically modified: the mass divergence at finite time is cured and the thermodynamical properties are deeply changed. Some potential consequences for quantum gravity and bouncing models are also pointed out. Those conclusions being mostly obtained from a Newtonian approach, they only aim at guiding toward a more rigorous treatment. Still, interestingly, the behavior is far more convincing that the one usually obtained.</description>

      <title>Systematics of the chemical freeze-out line in the high baryon density regime explored at SIS100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systematic uncertainties of chemical freeze-out fits at SIS100 energies (Au+Au reactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3-5$ GeV) are studied using UrQMD simulations. Although hadron production in UrQMD does not occur on a sharp chemical freeze-out hyper-surface, the extracted fit quality is shown to be very good. The extracted chemical parameters depend on the selected hadron species as well as the underlying equation of state (EoS) of the matter. Including light nuclei and anti-protons in the fit increases the expected freeze-out temperature, while a stiffer EoS increases the obtained chemical potential. Similarly, the baryon densities extracted by the thermal fits depend on the choice of hadrons as well as the underlying equation of state. These results are important for the upcoming CBM@FAIR physics program and highlight that a degree of caution is advised when one relates the chemical freeze-out curve to features on the QCD phase diagram like the critical endpoint or a possible phase transition</description>

      <title>Shadow of Extreme Compact Charged Objects in Consistent 4-Dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to better describe gravitational phenomena on both very small and cosmological scales, there have been constant attempts to generalize and expand the theory of General Relativity (GR) since its inception. The Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) theory is one such extension that adds spacetime corrections related to curvature. Since the standard Gauss Bonnet term is purely topological, it does not contribute to the field equations in four dimensions. To get around this restriction, however, an invariant four dimensional limit has been developed. In this work, we study Extreme Compact Charged Objects (ECCOs), which can resemble black holes, in a gravity framework that is compatible with Einstein Gauss Bonnet in four dimensions. Our main goal is to compare theoretical predictions with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data in order to constrain the Gauss Bonnet coupling constant {\alpha}. In order to achieve this, we investigate important optical characteristics like the shadow, light bending angle, and other associated observables, as well as the geodesic structure of ECCO spacetimes in EGB gravity. Finally, we apply these findings to constrain the Gauss Bonnet constant.</description>

      <title>Is $\Lambda$CDM on the run? Reconciling the CMB with the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on the scale dependence of the primordial power spectrum by combining Planck, ACT DR6, SPT-3G and eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, extending sensitivity to smaller comoving scales. While ACT results previously indicated a mild preference for positive running of the spectral index, our joint analysis constrains both the running $\alpha_s$ and its running $\beta_s$. Including eBOSS markedly tightens these constraints, yielding a $&gt;2\sigma$ indication of nonzero $\alpha_s$ and/or $\beta_s$, challenging predictions from vanilla slow-roll inflation potentials. Comparing reconstructed spectral parameters with theoretical models, we find that inflationary potentials with localised dips, bumps, or oscillations better reproduce the observed scale dependence. We release the public PIPE code to test arbitrary inflationary potentials against these datasets.</description>

      <title>Precision lattice calculation of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electroweak gauge couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an update of our lattice QCD determination of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling, $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(-Q^2)$, and of the electroweak mixing angle in the space-like momentum region up to $Q^2=12\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$. The calculation is based on CLS ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ flavours of $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions, covering five lattice spacings between $0.039$ and $0.085$ fm and a range of pion masses, including the physical point. A refined analysis employing a telescopic window strategy allows for a clean separation of systematic effects across Euclidean distance scales. Statistical precision is further enhanced through low-mode averaging, combined with a spectral reconstruction of the vector-vector correlator at long distances on the most chiral ensembles. We confirm significant tensions of up to $7\sigma$ at space-like virtualities around $Q^2= 1\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$ between our lattice results for $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(-Q^2)$ and the corresponding data-driven estimates based on $e^+e^-$ cross section data. Combining our lattice data with perturbative QCD via the Euclidean split technique, we obtain at the $Z$-pole $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(M_Z^2) = 0.027813(33)_{\mathrm{lat}}(35)_{\mathrm{pQCD}}$, which is more than two times more precise than recent data-driven estimates. Our result deviates slightly, by $1-2\sigma$, from the value produced by global electroweak fits. For the electroweak mixing angle, we present the hadronic contribution to its running and provide a precise determination of the octet-singlet mixing component $\bar\Pi^{(0,8)}$, in good agreement with phenomenological models but with significantly higher precision.</description>

      <title>Accretion Process as a Probe of Extra Dimensions in MOG Compact Object Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of extra spatial dimensions arises from attempts to unify gravity with other fundamental interactions, develop a consistent theory of quantum gravity, and address open problems in particle physics and cosmology. Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding how such dimensions modify gravitational theories. One way to probe their impact is through the analytical study of astrophysical processes such as black hole accretion. Since accretion efficiently converts gravitational energy into radiation, this makes it a powerful tool to test modified gravity (MOG) theories and higher-dimensional frameworks via the behavior of dark compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of neutral particles around a higher-dimensional, regular, spherically symmetric MOG compact object, focusing on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), energy flux, temperature, and differential luminosity. We further analyze the accretion of a perfect fluid onto the same object, deriving analytical expressions for the four-velocity and proper energy density of the inflowing matter. Our findings show that extra dimensions reduce the ISCO radius while enhancing the corresponding flux and temperature. Finally, by comparing the effective disk temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$ with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*, we argue that MOG and higher-dimensional corrections to the accretion disk properties could be close to the current threshold of detectability.</description>

Abstract: The diffuse emission of gamma-rays and neutrinos, produced by interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar matter in the Milky Way, provides valuable insights into cosmic ray propagation and Galactic processes. Emission models incorporating different assumptions about cosmic ray diffusion, source distribution, and target gas density are tested using data from neutrino telescopes. In this study, the final all-flavor neutrino dataset, collected over 15 years (2007--2022) by the ANTARES neutrino telescope, is analyzed. A maximum likelihood ratio method built to handle templates of Galactic emission models is employed to evaluate the compatibility of these models with the observed spatial and energy distributions of neutrino events. The results do not yield stringent constraints on the tested models and upper limits on the diffuse neutrino flux are derived, which are compatible with the results obtained by other experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as a probe of Long Lived Right-handed Neutrinos, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter: Gobal versus Local B-L Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scale of the seesaw mechanism is typically much larger than the electroweak scale. This hierarchy can be naturally explained by $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking, simultaneously generates Majorana masses for neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. Such strings generate a gravitational wave (GW) spectrum which is expected to be almost uniform in frequency unless there is a departure from the usual early radiation domination. We explore this possibility in Type I, II and III seesaw frameworks, finding that only for Type-I, long-lived right-handed neutrinos (RHN) may provide a period of early matter domination for parts of the parameter space, even if they are thermally produced. Such a period leaves distinctive imprints in the GW spectrum in the form of characteristic breaks and a knee feature, arising due to the end and start of the periods of RHN domination. These features, if detected, directly determine the mass $M$, and effective neutrino mass $\tilde m$ of the dominating RHN. We find that GW detectors like LISA and ET could probe RHN masses in the range $M\in[0.1,10^{9}]$ GeV and effective neutrino masses in the $\tilde m\in[10^{-10},10^{-8}]$ eV range. We investigate the phenomenological implications of long-lived right-handed neutrinos for both local and global $U(1)_{B-L}$ strings, focusing on dark matter production and leptogenesis. We map the viable and detectable parameter space for successful baryogenesis and asymmetric dark matter production from right-handed neutrino decays. We derive analytical and semi-analytical relations correlating the characteristic gravitational-wave frequencies to the neutrino parameters $\tilde m$ and $M$, as well as to the relic abundances of dark matter and baryons.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional sizes and shapes of pion emission in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of precision measurements in high-energy heavy-ion physics, there is an increasing expectation towards phenomenological and theoretical studies to provide a better description of data. In recent years, multiple experiments have confirmed through two-pion Bose-Einstein correlation measurements that the shape of the two-pion pair source can be well described by Levy-stable distributions. However, direct comparisons of new phenomenological results with the data are still needed to understand the underlying phenomena and learn more about the nature of pion emission. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional analysis of the two-pion source in Monte-Carlo simulations of Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV per nucleon collision energy, and discuss a detailed comparison with the most recent centrality-dependent measurements from the PHENIX Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Skewness-dependent Moments of Pion GPD from Nonlocal Quark-Bilinear Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Emulation of Proton-Deuteron Scattering via the Reduced Basis Method and Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce highly accurate and efficient emulators for proton-deuteron scattering below the deuteron breakup threshold. We explore two different reduced-basis method strategies: one based on the Kohn variational principle and another on Galerkin projections of the underlying system of linear equations. We use the adaptive greedy algorithm previously developed for two-body scattering for optimal selection of high-fidelity training points in the input parameter space. We demonstrate that these emulators reproduce ab initio hyperspherical harmonics calculations of $R$-matrix elements with remarkable precision, achieving relative errors as low as $10^{-7}$ with a small number of training points, even in regions of strong nonlinear parameter dependence. They also dramatically accelerate the exploration of the scattering predictions in the parameter space, a capability highly desired for calibrating (chiral) three-nucleon forces against scattering measurements. Our formalism can be further generalized to handle nucleon-deuteron scattering above the breakup threshold. These emulator developments will provide valuable tools to accelerate uncertainty quantification and rigorous parameter inference in the study of nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>Light(ly)-coupled Dark Matter in the keV Range: Freeze-In and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.03389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter produced from thermal freeze-out is typically restricted to have masses above roughly 1 MeV. However, if the couplings are small, the freeze-in mechanism allows for production of dark matter down to keV masses. We consider dark matter coupled to a dark photon that mixes with the photon and dark matter coupled to photons through an electric or magnetic dipole moment. We discuss contributions to the freeze-in production of such dark matter particles from standard model fermion-antifermion annihilation and plasmon decay. We also derive constraints on such dark matter from the cooling of red giant stars and horizontal branch stars, carefully evaluating the thermal processes as well as the bremsstrahlung process that dominates for masses above the plasma frequency. We find that the parameters needed to obtain the observed relic abundance from freeze-in are excluded below a few tens of keV, depending on the value of the dark gauge coupling constant for the dark photon portal model, and below a few keV, depending on the reheating temperature for dark matter with an electric or magnetic dipole moment. While laboratory probes are unlikely to probe these freeze-in scenarios in general, we show that for dark matter with an electric or magnetic dipole moment and for dark matter masses above the reheating temperature, the couplings needed for freeze-in to produce the observed relic abundance can be probed partially by upcoming direct-detection experiments.</description>

In this work we have performed a comparative study of charged hadron spectra in $pp$, $pPb$ and $PbPb$ collision using the $q$ parameter obtained from the $q$-Weibull distribution function. We observed a disparity in the trend of $q$ parameter in high $p_T$ range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The restoration of dynamical chiral symmetry for a higher number of light-quark flavors $N_f$ implies suppression of the dynamically generated quark mass. The study of various larger values of $N_f$ may have a greater impact on the internal structure of light hadrons. In this work, we study the properties of the $\pi$- (pion) and $K$-meson (kaon), such as the mass, condensate, and leptonic decay constant, for various $N_f$. We use the symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dependent contact interaction model of quark. The dynamical quark masses are calculated using the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE). The masses of pion ($m_{\pi}$) and kaon ($m_{K}$) for different values of $N_f$ and are determined using the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation. For fixed $N_c=3$ and $N_f$ is increased, the dynamically generated quark mass $M_{u/d}$ ( mass of up and down quarks), strange quark mass ($M_s$), meson in-condensate $\kappa^{1/3}_{(\pi,K)}$, and decay constant $f_{(\pi, K)}$. monotonically decrease as a function of $N_f$, except for the pion and kaon mass $m_{(\pi, K)}$, which increase above a critical value of $N_f$ around $8$. This is the region where chiral symmetry is restored and the pion and kaon behave as free particles, similar to thier behavior in the the presence of a heat bath. The results obtained for fixed $N_f=2$ and $N_c=3$ are fairly in decent agreement with experimentally calculated statistics and previous model calculations based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE).</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Elementary and Bound State Fields on Vacuum Stability in $t\bar{t}$ Production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04672v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent report by the CMS Collaboration on the excess of top and anti-top pair production is examined with regard to the improvement of vacuum stability under two simple scenarios: one with the existence of toponium $(\eta_t)$, and the other with an additional elementary field $(\Psi)$. In both cases, the values of each coupling constant are restricted by the Multicritical Point Principle (MPP).
  Two scenarios are considered. The first incorporates the effect of toponium $(\eta_t)$, inspired by the Bardeen-Hill-Lindner (BHL) framework, and the second embeds $\Psi$ into the Standard Model (SM) as a minimal model close to an inert doublet model. From these analyses, it is found that toponium cannot satisfy the MPP, whereas the additional elementary field can.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity corrections to the spontaneous excitation of an accelerated atom interacting with a quantum scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) extends the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) by suggesting a minimum observable scale that includes the effects of quantum gravity, which is supposed to potentially result in observable effects far below the Planck energy scale, providing us the opportunity to explore the theory of quantum gravity through physical processes at low energy scale. In present work, we study the corrections induced by the GUP to the spontaneous radiation properties of a two-level atom interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field based on the DDC formalism. The GUP alters the correlation function of the scalar field, consequently affecting the radiative properties of atoms. We calculate the rate of change in the mean atomic energy for an atom undergoing inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and uniform circular motion. We show that the GUP can modify the spontaneous emission rate of an excited-state atom in inertial motion; however, it does not alter the stability of the ground-state atom in vacuum. For an atom in uniformly accelerated and uniformly circular motions, the GUP can change both its spontaneous emission and excitation rates; moreover, the corrections caused by the GUP contains the terms proportional to $\beta a^2$ or $\beta a^3$, suggesting that the proper acceleration $a$ of an atom in non-inertial motions could significantly amplify the effect of the GUP on the spontaneous transition rates of the atom.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV with natural Yukawa couplings of $O(1)$, making the test of neutrino seesaw a great challenge. It is intriguing to note that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the upper range of the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a new framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. With the neutrino seesaw mechanism, we construct a new realization of the Higgs modulated reheating, in which the fluctuations of Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays and contribute to the primordial curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate, for the first time, that such signatures provide an important means to directly probe the high scale of natural neutrino seesaw. We further analyze the interplay of the non-Gaussianity signatures with the low-energy neutrino experiments, and their interplay with the Higgs self-coupling measurements at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. In this Letter, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. In our framework, after inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field that act as the source of curvature perturbations. This gives a new realization of Higgs modulated reheating, and it produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures that can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the valence quark model recently calculated for polarized proton to constrain the non-perturbative initial condition for the small-$x$ helicity evolution. The remaining free parameters are constrained by performing a global analysis to the available polarized small-$x$ deep inelastic scattering data. A good description of the world data is obtained with only 8 free parameters. The model parameters are tightly constrained by the data, allowing us to predict the proton polarized structure function $g_1^p$ to be negative at small $x$. Furthermore, we obtain the small-$x$ quark and gluon spins to give a contribution $\int_{10^{-5}}^{0.1} dx \left( \frac{1}{2}\Delta\Sigma + \Delta G \right) = 0.76 \pm 0.13$ or $1.70\pm 0.20$ to the proton spin, depending on the applied running coupling prescription.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation with Vector-Like Quark Stabilisation and the ACT spectral index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034$. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$, which is 2.74$\sigma$ below the ACT mean value. We show that when an otherwise metastable Standard Model Higgs Inflation potential is stabilised by the addition of vector-like quark pairs and the potential is renormalised in the Jordan frame, the value of $n_s$ is generally larger than 0.965 and can explain the ACT observation. As an example, assuming the 2022 PDG direct measurement central value for the t quark mass, $m_{t} = 172.69$ GeV, and central values for the SM inputs to the renormalisation group equations, we obtain $n_s = 0.9792 - 0.9844$ for the case of three isosinglet vector-like B quarks with mass $m_{Q}$ in the range 1-3 TeV, with the lowest value of the $n_s$ range being 1.44$\sigma$ above the ACT mean value. The model predicts primordial gravitational wave with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.87 \times 10^{-3} - 1.21 \times 10^{-2}$ for $m_{Q} =$ 1-3 TeV, which will be easily observable in forthcoming CMB experiments. Observation of vector-like quarks of mass close to 1 TeV mass combined with a large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \sim 0.01$ would support the model.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the existence of an axion-like particle (ALP), beams of relativistic particles emit fluxes of quasi-real ALPs, analogous to the photon fluxes described by Weizs\"acker-Williams-type approximations. Consequently, ALP-ALP and ALP-photon collisions can occur at the LHC. We initiate the study of the LHC as an ALP collider, and show that ALP collisions provide competitive probes of certain ALP couplings. We show that ALP fluxes from heavy ions are suppressed relative to those from protons, unlike their photon counterpart. As a result, the most likely processes are ALP-photon collisions occurring in the proton-ion ($p$A) ultraperipheral collisions. Using our implementation of ALP fluxes in simulation tools, we show that ALP-photon collisions in $p$Pb efficiently probe ALP couplings to third generation fermions. LHC data with realistic $p$Pb luminosity can constrain the product of ALP couplings to nucleons and top quarks at the level of $O(0.01$ TeV$^{-1})$. Notably, ALP-photon collisions naturally provide the leading probe of ALP flavor-violating couplings to the top quark. We suggest that the 2016 $p$Pb dataset collected at CMS, ATLAS, and LHCb should be explored for evidence of such collisions.</description>

      <title>Boosting Sensitivity to $HH\to b\bar{b} \gamma\gamma$ with Graph Neural Networks and XGBoost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance the sensitivity of double Higgs boson searches in the \( HH \to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma \) decay channel at $\sqrt{s} = $ 13.6 TeV. Two ML models are implemented and compared: a tree-based classifier using XGBoost, and a geometrical-based graph neural network classifier (GNN). We show that the geometrical model outperform the traditional XGBoost classifier improving the expected 95\% CL upper limit on the double Higgs boson production cross-section by 28\%. Our results are compared to the latest ATLAS experiment results, showing significant improvement of both upper limit and Higgs boson self-coupling ($\kappa_{\lambda}$) constraints.</description>

      <title>Production of $J/\psi p \bar p$ in electron-positron collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discoveries of the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquarks by the LHCb Collaboration have been not confirmed by other experiments yet. It is desirable to investigate the feasibility of observing them in other experiments. We present an order-of-magnitude estimate of the cross section of the $e^+e^-\to J/\psi p \bar p$ process, where the hidden-charm pentaquarks may be searched for, and find it to be of $\mathcal{O}(4~\text{fb})$ when the $e^+e^-$ c.m. energy is around 6 GeV. The cross section for $e^+e^-\to P_c \bar p$ is then estimated to be $\lesssim \mathcal{O}(0.1~\text{pb})$. Thus, it is promising to search for $P_c$ at the future high-luminosity super tau-charm facilities with annual integrated luminosity about $1~ab^{-1}$. We also predict the branching fraction of $\Upsilon\to J/\psi p\bar p$ to be of $\mathcal{O}(2\times 10^{-6})$, which can be tested at $B$ factories.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological description of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)\to D_s\pi^0$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For coupled channels $D^0K^+$, $D^+K^0$, $D_s^+\eta$, and $D_s^+\pi^0$, the $S$-wave scattering amplitudes are constructed taking into account the mixing of the isoscalar resonance $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+$ with nonresonance amplitudes with isospin $I=1$. The phenomenological approach we use allows us to quite simply clear up the general structure of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay amplitude violating isospin. We show that the phase of this amplitude coincides with the phase of the nonresonanct $D_s^+\pi^0 $ scattering amplitude in agreement with the Watson theorem. Its modulus squared, as it should be, determines the width of the resonance peak in the $D_s^+\pi^0$ channel. Taking into account the $\pi^0-\eta$ mixing in internal lines up to the second order inclusively ensures that the unitarity condition is fulfilled. The presented analysis complements the description of the $D^*_{s0}(2317 )^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay based on the coupled channel unitarized chiral perturbation theory. The numerical estimates obtained by us for the $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay width do not contradict those available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Transversity Generalized Parton Distributions of $\Delta$ with the Diquark Spectator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show quark transversity generalized parton pistributions (GPDs) of $\Delta^+$ isobar by using the diquark spectator model for the first time. First, this model is tested by electric charge, magnetic-dipole and axial charge form factors, and it is used for calculating the transversity GPDs $H^{qT}_{1,3,5,7}$ of $\Delta^+$. The quark transversity distribution $h_1$ is then obtained from the transversity GPDs in the forward limit. Then, helicity-flip amplitudes are shown numerically by using relations between the helicity amplitudes and the GPDs. Finally, by taking first moments of the GPDs, tensor form factors are obtained and we predict the tensor charge. Experimentally, $N$-$\Delta$ transition GPDs are investigated in deeply virtual Compton scattering and virtual meson-production processes, and generalized distribution amplitudes, which correspond to the $s$-channel GPDs, could be investigated by the two-photon processes $\gamma^* \gamma \to \Delta \bar\Delta$ at the electron-positron colliders. Therefore, the spin-3/2 $\Delta$ GPDs could become interesting quantities experimentally in future.</description>

Abstract: To resolve ambiguities from multiple solutions in experimental measurements, we construct a $\chi^2$ function incorporating constraints such as isospin conservation and amplitude relations. By minimizing the global $\chi^2$, we identify physical solutions for seven hidden-charm decay channels of $Y(4230)$. Crucially, the physical solution for $Y(4230) \to \pi^{+}\pi^{-} J/\psi$ corresponds to the largest among four experimental solutions, potentially modifying inputs for theoretical calculations. Additionally, we predict $\Gamma_{ee} B(Y(4230) \to \pi^{+}\pi^{-} \psi(2S))$ based on our results, acknowledging substantial uncertainties in current measurements.</description>

      <title>The kaon off-shell generalized parton distributions and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the off-shell generalized parton distributions (GPDs) {and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs)} of kaons within the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, employing proper time regularization. {Compared to the pion case, the off-shell effects in kaons are of similar magnitude, modifying the GPDs by about $10\%$--$25\%$, which is notable. The absence of crossing symmetry leads to odd powers in the $x$-moments of the off-shell GPDs, giving rise to new off-shell form factors.} We analyze the relations among these kaon off-shell form factors by analogy with electromagnetic form factors. Our results extend the off-shell GPDs from pions to kaons and simultaneously address the associated off-shell form factors. We also compare the off-shell and on-shell gravitational form factors of the kaon. In addition, the off-shell kaon TMD shows a stronger dependence on the momentum fraction $x$ than its on-shell counterpart.</description>

      <title>Probing a Light Scalar Boson with a few-MeV Proton Beam Deep Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to investigate the production of a light scalar boson $\phi$ in low-energy proton-nucleus interactions using the 3.5 MV accelerator of the Bellotti Ion Beam Facility, located in the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory. Nuclear reactions induced by a few-MeV proton beam on suitable target materials can act as a controlled source of $\phi$ particles. Owing to the deep-underground location, the facility benefits from substantial cosmic-ray shielding, enabling searches for rare processes with minimal background. The produced $\phi$ particles will be sought with large-volume, low-background detectors already operating or currently under construction at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory. This approach combines a tunable accelerator-based production mechanism with the exceptional sensitivity of underground rare-event searches, offering a novel avenue to probe light scalar bosons beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: The contribution of the electromagnetic interaction to the self-energy of pseudo-Goldstone bosons, as well as to the mixing angles and weak decay constants, is calculated in the first nonleading order in the simultaneous expansion in powers of $1/N_c$, momenta and quark masses. Particular attention is paid to the isospin symmetry breaking which is generated by means of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ admixtures to the pion. It is shown that the gluon anomaly enhances the electromagnetic contribution to the $\pi^0$-$\eta$ and $\pi^0$-$\eta'$ mixing angles, which facilitates the restoration of isospin symmetry in the spectrum of pseudo-Goldstone states at next-to-leading order. The contribution of the electromagnetic interaction to the $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing angle is shown to be only about 3\%.</description>

      <title>Strengthening the Bridge Between Chiral Lagrangians and QCD Sum-Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that mesonic fields in chiral Lagrangians can be systematically connected to quark-level operators in QCD sum rules through chiral-symmetry constrained and energy-independent scale factor matrices. This framework yields universal scale factors associated with each chiral nonet, whether composed of quark-antiquark ($q\bar{q}$) or four-quark ($qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$) operators. Building on the demonstrated scale-factor universality for the $K_0^*$ isodoublet and $a_0$ isotriplet scalar mesons, we develop a revised Gaussian QCD sum-rule methodology that extends the analysis to higher-dimensional isospin sectors. To access nonperturbative information about resonances arising from final-state interactions, we introduce a background-resonance interference approximation. This approximation successfully reproduces both $\pi K$ scattering amplitude data and $\pi\eta$ scattering predictions. It also motivates new resonance models that enhance the scale-factor analysis linking chiral Lagrangians to QCD sum rules. Within this refined framework, we explore the scale factors for the $K_0^*$ and $a_0$ mesons across a sequence of increasingly detailed resonance models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the maximum entropy prescription to determine a quantum state of a small collision system at the kinetic freeze-out. We derive expressions for multiplicity-selected particle momentum spectra and correlation functions by applying a fixed particle number constraint to this state. The results of our analysis can be useful for interpreting the multiplicity dependence of the particle momentum spectra and correlations in high-multiplicity $pp$ collision events at a fixed LHC energy.</description>

      <title>How large are hadronic contributions to $h \to \gamma \gamma$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of the Higgs boson into two photons, $h \to \gamma \gamma$, is a loop-induced process within the Standard Model, predominantly mediated by loops of $W$ bosons and top quarks. While these leading contributions are well understood, the role of hadronic effects, which arise from non-perturbative QCD dynamics, has received less attention, with recent studies reporting puzzling and contradictory results. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of the hadronic contributions to the $h \to \gamma \gamma$ decay width using dispersion relations. Our analysis shows that these contributions are exceedingly small, as expected, altering the decay width by about $0.004\%$ under conservative assumptions. Therefore, hadronic effects can be safely neglected even in the context of future high-precision Higgs measurements at current and next-generation colliders. As an aside, we also estimate the possible size of hadronic contributions to Higgs production in gluon-gluon fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent report by CMS Collaboration on the excess of top and anti-top pair production is studied, under the hypothesis of the coexistence of a toponium $(\eta_t)$ and an additional elementary field $(\Psi)$. We examine the scenario where toponium and an additional field are mixed, and consider the plausible scenarios in that case. Two scenarios are examined: one is the minimal model with $\Psi$ close to the inert Higgs doublet, and the other is embedded into the two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), where $\Psi$ is one of the two Higgs scalars after transforming the basis. The value of the each coupling constant is restricted by the Multicritical Point Principle (MPP). Consistency with the data gives constraints on a mixing angle $\theta\ (-45^\circ\le\theta\le45^\circ)$, with which the mass eigenstate $\Psi^\prime$ contributing to the excess is defined by $\Psi^\prime=\Psi\cos \theta + \eta_t\sin \theta$. The obtained results are $|\theta| \le 13^{\circ}$ for the minimum scenario, and $|\theta| \le 1^{\circ}$ for the second scenario of 2HDM(Type II and Y). We also briefly discuss the comparison with Type I and X.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Compton process with the initial states of photons and neutrons described by the density matrices of a general form is studied for low energies of photons. The coherent contribution to the inclusive probability to record a photon is investigated in detail. This contribution gives the hologram of the neutron one-particle density matrix. The evolution of the Stokes parameters of scattered photons is described. The susceptibility tensor of a neutron gas and a wave packet of a single neutron is obtained. The explicit expression for the photon polarization operator in the presence of free neutrons is derived. It turns out that this polarization operator possesses pole singularities in the short wavelength approximation. These singularities corresponding to the additional degrees of freedom are identified with plasmons and the respective plasmon-polaritons are described. There are eight independent plasmon-polariton modes in a neutron gas and on a single neutron wave packet. Some plasmon-polariton modes prove to be tachyonic and unstable manifesting a spontaneous generation of the magnetic field. The estimates of the parameters of the neutron gas when it becomes ferromagnetic are found. In the infrared limit, the neutron wave packet behaves in coherent Compton scattering as a point particle with dynamical magnetic moment, the additional degrees of freedom being reduced to the dynamical part of the magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Pentaquarks on the light front, and their mixture with baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous papers we developed the light front formulation for Hamiltonians and wave functions (WFs) for mesons and baryons, with both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. For baryons limited to the lowest Fock component with three quarks, the longitudinal WF is valued in an equilateral triangle with momentum fractions $x_i,i=1,2,3$. The WF was developed both numerically and using a basis function that diagonalizes the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper we extend this analysis to $n$ quark states, and specialize to pentaquarks ($n=5$). We determine their masses and WFs, and address the mixing between baryons and pentaquarks, the issue central to understanding the observed antiquark sea of baryons.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay $A\to ZH$ is a characteristic signal of two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs), where $A$ and $H$ lie primarily within the same $SU(2)_L$ multiplet, leading to a coupling of order $g_2$ to the $Z$ boson. The subsequent decay $H\to tt^{(*)}$ is particularly promising, as it gives rise to distinct final states involving multiple leptons and $b$-jets. The required splitting between $m_A$ and $m_H$ can naturally occur near the electroweak scale while being consistent with perturbative unitarity. Whereas dedicated ATLAS and CMS searches focused on the region with both top-quarks on-shell, we cover lower masses where one top quark is off-shell by recasting Standard Model $t\bar{t}Z$ measurements of ATLAS and CMS. The obtained limits on $\sigma(A\to ZH)\times {\rm Br} (H\to t\bar t)$ are between $0.12$ pb and $0.62$ pb. Interestingly, we observe these stringent limits despite a preference (up to $2.5\sigma$) for a non-zero new physics signal, most pronounced around for $m_A \approx 450-460$ GeV and $m_H\approx 290$ GeV, with a best-fit value of $\sigma(A \to ZH) \times {\rm Br}(H \to t\bar t) \approx 0.3$ pb. This cross section can be accommodated within a top-philic 2HDM for a top-Yukawa coupling of the second Higgs doublet of $\mu_t \gtrsim 0.16$.</description>

      <title>Probing the existence of a new charged vector boson decaying into heavy neutral leptons using ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions at ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the potential of Ultra-peripheral Collisions in the LHC to investigate new physics, focusing specifically on the production of new charged vector bosons ${V}^{\pm}$ that decay into heavy neutral leptons $N_{L}$ in the context of the Vector Scotogenic Model. We show that the ATLAS experiment searching for dilepton+met final states through UPCs of lead ions, can prove the existence of new charged vector bosons in the mass range 5-100 GeV, a region not explored by the LEP-II experiment. Our analysis identifies regions in the parameter space where the signal can be distinguished from the background with high statistical significance. Within the mass range 5 GeV $&lt;M_{V^{\pm}}, M_{N_L}&lt;$ 100 GeV, ATLAS can exclude scenarios with 95\% of C.L. for specific mass scenarios such as (30 GeV, 20 GeV), (30 GeV, 10 GeV) and (20 GeV, 10 GeV). In a discovery context, ATLAS could reach a significance of 5$\sigma$ only for (20 GeV, 10 GeV). Furthermore, we show that in the absence of new physics signals at ATLAS, the High Luminosity LHC with UPCs of protons could explore further into larger mass ranges, specifically 100 GeV $&lt; M_{V^{\pm}}&lt;$ 200 GeV and 5 GeV $&lt;M_{N_L}&lt;$ 200 GeV. We find that the HL-LHC can exclude this mass range with 95\% of C.L., and most scenarios can achieve a discovery significance of 5$\sigma$</description>

      <title>Cosmic magnification in beyond-Horndeski gravity</title>

Abstract: Cosmic magnification is able to probe the geometry of large-scale structure on cosmological scales, thereby providing another window for probing theories of the late-time cosmic acceleration. It holds the potential to reveal new information on the nature of dark energy and modified gravity. By using the angular power spectrum, we investigated cosmic magnification beyond weak lensing (incorporating all known relativistic corrections) in beyond-Horndeski gravity$-$with both constant phenomenology and dynamic phenomenology, respectively. For both phenomenologies our results show that the total relativistic signal surpasses cosmic variance (considering an SKA2-like sky coverage) in the magnification angular power spectrum at low redshifts ($z\lesssim 0.5$), hence cosmic-variance reduction methods like multi-tracer analysis will not be needed for surveys at the given $z$. For the individual relativistic signals, we found that the Doppler magnification signal also surpasses cosmic variance and remains the dominant signal, at low $z$, for both phenomenologies. However, the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational (potential) magnification signals, respectively, are subdominant to both the Doppler magnification signal and cosmic variance, at the same $z$; hence multi-tracer analysis will be needed to isolate these signals. At high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 3$), the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational magnification signals, respectively, appear to surpass cosmic variance and dominate over the Doppler magnification signal for constant phenomenology; whereas for dynamic phenomenology, all these signals diminish significantly and are well below cosmic variance, at all $z$ (consistent with recent quintessence analysis). Suggesting that including time-variation in the parameters will be crucial in identifying the true signature of the beyond-Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations to compute cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background quantities, like neutrino density, deflection angle, and velocity, with other quantities, like cold dark matter density and effective weak lensing convergence, by accounting for the space-time delay between signals on Earth. We provide this to theoretically illustrate how much can be learned from these cross-correlation signals, once the cosmic neutrino background is detected with instruments in multiple locations. Against a naive expectation of null cross-correlation, we show that the signal is non zero, specially at the largest scales. We also discuss the scenario of co-located cross-correlations between dark matter, weak lensing and a future neutrino-induced photon emission signal. As cross-correlations will be comparable to auto-correlations of the cosmic neutrino background itself and are less affected by cosmic variance and shotnoise, these might be the ones to be measured first. Our predictions thus provide the imprint of what cosmological massive neutrinos, with total mass $\sum{m_\nu} \sim 0.1$ eV, should look like from cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Robust semi-parametric signal detection in particle physics with classifiers decorrelated via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for signals of new physics in particle physics are usually done by training a supervised classifier to separate a signal model from the known Standard Model physics (also called the background model). However, even when the signal model is correct, systematic errors in the background model can influence supervised classifiers and might adversely affect the signal detection procedure. To tackle this problem, one approach is to use the (possibly misspecified) classifier only to perform a preliminary signal-enrichment step and then to carry out a signal detection test on the signal-rich sample. For this procedure to work, we need a classifier constrained to be decorrelated with one or more protected variables used for the signal-detection step. We do this by considering an optimal transport map of the classifier output that makes it independent of the protected variable(s) for the background. We then fit a semiparametric mixture model to the distribution of the protected variable after making cuts on the transformed classifier to detect the presence of a signal. We compare and contrast this decorrelation method with previous approaches, show that the decorrelation procedure is robust to moderate background misspecification, and analyze the power and validity of the signal detection test as a function of the cut on the classifier both with and without decorrelation. We conclude that decorrelation and signal enrichment help produce a stable, robust, valid, and more powerful test.</description>

      <title>The tidal evolution of anisotropic subhaloes: A new pathway to creating isotropic and cored satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.</description>

      <title>Clustering and Runaway Merging in a Primordial Black Hole Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBH) are present in the early universe, their contribution to the energy budget grows relative to that of radiation and generically becomes dominant unless the initial abundance is exponentially small. This black hole domination scenario is largely unconstrained for PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$, which evaporate prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, if the era of PBH domination is sufficiently long, the PBHs form clusters and can merge appreciably within these objects. We calculate the population statistics of these clusters within the Press-Schechter formalism and find that, for a wide range of PBH masses and Hubble rates at the onset of PBH domination, the mergers within PBH clusters can exhibit runaway behavior, where the majority of the cluster will eventually form a single black hole with a mass much greater than the original PBH mass. These mergers can dramatically alter the PBH mass distribution and leave behind merged relic black holes that evaporate after Big Bang nucleosynthesis and yield various observational signatures, excluding parameter choices previously thought to be viable</description>

      <title>Using Gravitational Wave Signals to Disentangle Early Matter Dominated Epochs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.</description>

      <title>FRB cosmology with the RM-PRS Luminosity Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relation. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM) of FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS). We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\mathrm{DM}-z$ method. Utilizing the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated FRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 = 86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray Production in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Having previously argued that binary neutron star mergers are the principle source of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays~\citep{fBNS-prl25}, we exploit here the highly constrained initial conditions to make quantitative predictions for the cutoff energy of various nuclei. UHECRs heavier than helium are accelerated in the magnetized turbulent outflow outside the jets to a rigidity $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} \equiv E_{\rm cut}/eZ \approx 6-9$ EV, consistent with the measured value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} = 6.3^{+6.3}_{-2.3}\,$EV from fitting data. This agreement strengthens the case that BNS mergers are the main site of UHECR production.
  The jets may accelerate protons and/or helium to cutoff energies $\approx 11.5$ and $\approx 35$ EeV, respectively. Such a jet component and its spallation products could explain the indication of a secondary light population at higher energy found in the analysis of~\citet{muf19}. The relative abundances of different elements and the total energy in UHECRs per merger event will become calculable, pending advances in our understanding of the mechanism of ion uptake into the acceleration process and input from nuclear physics experiments.
  This scenario implies that each neutrino above 1 PeV is co-directional with a gravitational wave arriving $\approx 1$ day earlier, and that the highest energy UHECRs have masses heavier than iron.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Baryon Junction: a lattice computation in 2 +1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in (2+1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within the Effective String Theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the corrections proportional to the mass of the baryon junction M, up to order $1/R^2$ (where $R$ is the length of the confining strings), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of this paper is, through high precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open string channel, we obtain the value $M/\sqrt{\sigma} = 0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used to describe hadrons, although our computation was done in (2+1) dimensions. In addition, studying the high temperature behavior of the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focusing on the high temperature regime, just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative predictions obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three-state Potts model in two dimensions and find excellent agreement.</description>

Abstract: We determine the average state and the uncorrelated modes that characterize the event-by-event fluctuations of the initial state in two typical centrality classes of Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. We find that modes in a narrow central bin are similar to those in events at fixed vanishing impact parameter, while those in a mid-peripheral centrality class are affected by the impact-parameter variation. We study how each fluctuation mode affects observables both in the initial state and in the final state of the collisions, at the end of a state-of-the-art boost-invariant hybrid evolution with KoMPoST + MUSIC + iSS + SMASH, and show that implementing a hadronic transport cascade in such a mode-by-mode analysis with reasonable statistical noise is costly but feasible.</description>

Abstract: A finite formulation of quantum field theory based on a system of differential equations reminiscent of the Callan-Symanzik equations is discussed. This system of equations was previously formulated in the bare language. We rederive it in a fully renormalized language. For the latter, within a simple $\phi^4$ toy model, it is shown that with a specific choice of renormalization conditions - namely, the on-shell scheme for the renormalized mass - this class of finite renormalization prescriptions is equivalent to the standard renormalization-group equation written in the Callan-Symanzik-Ovsyannikov form.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star mergers, proto-neutron stars and core-collapse supernovae involve finite temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Previous studies on the effect of magnetic fields on flavor-equilibration processes relied on the Fermi surface approximation, which is not a reliable approximation in the neutrino-transparent regime of matter in supernovae or neutron star mergers. In a recent study, we went beyond the Fermi surface approximation, performing the full phase space integral to obtain direct Urca rates in a background magnetic field. In this work, we extend these calculations to incorporate the collisional broadening (``modified Urca'') contribution. We use the recently developed Nucleon Width Approximation, which naturally includes the magnetic field dependence of all contributions. We demonstrate the impact of magnetic fields on the flavor-equilibrium condition for two finite-temperature equations of state with different direct Urca thresholds. We also study the impact of magnetic fields on the bulk viscous dissipation of density oscillations relevant in postmerger scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Swift Memory Burden Effect with GW250114-like Events</title>

Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole's information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 3$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes for Inferring Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extraction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from experimental or lattice QCD data is an ill-posed inverse problem, where regularization strongly impacts both systematic uncertainties and the reliability of the results. We study a framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct PDFs from lattice QCD matrix elements. Within a Bayesian framework, Gaussian processes serve as flexible priors that encode uncertainties, correlations, and constraints without imposing rigid functional forms. We investigate a wide range of kernel choices, mean functions, and hyperparameter treatments. We quantify information gained from the data using the Kullback Leibler divergence. Synthetic data tests demonstrate the consistency and robustness of the method. Our study establishes GPR as a systematic and non-parametric approach to PDF reconstruction, offering controlled uncertainty estimates and reduced model bias in lattice QCD analyses.</description>
