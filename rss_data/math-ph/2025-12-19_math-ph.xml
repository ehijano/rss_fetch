      <title>Rota-Baxter operators on braces, post-braces and the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining the notions of braces and relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups in connection with the Yang-Baxter equation and a factorization theorem of Lie groups from integrable systems, relative Rota-Baxter operators on braces and post-braces are introduced. A relative Rota-Baxter operator on a brace naturally induces a post-brace, and conversely, every post-brace determines a relative Rota-Baxter operator on its sub-adjacent brace. Furthermore, a post-brace yields two Drinfel'd-isomorphic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. As a special case, {\it enhanced} relative Rota-Baxter operators give rise to matched pairs of braces. Focusing on enhanced Rota-Baxter operators on two-sided braces, a corresponding factorization theorem is established. Examples are provided from the two-sided brace associated with the three-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry classification and exact solutions of a diffusive Lotka-Volterra system with convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model for description of the viscous fingering induced by a chemical reaction is under study. This complicated five-component model is reduced to a three-component diffusive Lotka-Volterra system with convection by introducing a stream function. The system obtained is examined by the classical Lie method. A complete Lie symmetry classification is derived via a rigorous algorithm. In particular, it is proved that the widest Lie algebras of invariance occur when the stream function generate a linear velocity field. The most interesting cases (from the symmetry and applicability point of view) are further studied in order to derive exact solutions. A wide range of exact solutions are constructed for radially-symmetric stream functions. These solutions include time-dependent and radially symmetric solutions as well as more complicated solutions expressed in terms of the Weierstrass function. It was shown that some of exact solutions can be used for demonstration of spatiotemporal evolution of concentrations corresponding to two reactants and their product.</description>

      <title>Rationally-extended radial harmonic oscillator in a position-dependent mass background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the radial harmonic oscillator problem in the position-dependent mass background of the type $m(\alpha;r) = (1+\alpha r^2)^{-2}$, $\alpha&gt;0$, can be solved by using a point canonical transformation mapping the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation onto that of the P\"oschl-Teller I potential with constant mass. The radial harmonic oscillator problem with position-dependent mass is shown to exhibit a deformed shape invariance property in a deformed supersymmetric framework. The inverse point canonical transformation then provides some exactly-solvable rational extensions of the radial harmonic oscillator with position-dependent mass associated with $X_m$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type I, II, or III. The extended potentials of type I and II are proved to display deformed shape invariance. The spectrum and wavefunctions of the radial harmonic oscillator potential and its extensions are shown to go over to well-known results when the deforming parameter $\alpha$ goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Ground states for the Hartree energy functional in the critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a minimizer $u$ in $ H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for the Hartree energy functional with convolution potential $w$ in $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)+L^{3/2,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ with $L^\infty$ part vanishing at infinity. This class includes sums of potentials of the kind $-\frac{1}{|x|^\alpha}$, $0&lt;\alpha\le2$, together with the case $w$ in $L^{3/2}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. We prove the existence of such groundstates for a wide range of $L^2$ masses. We also establish basic properties of the groundstates, i.e.~positivity and regularity. Lastly, we exploit the estimates we derived for the stationary problem to prove global well-posedness of the associated evolution problem and orbital stability of the set of ground states.</description>

      <title>An equivalence in random matrix and tensor models via a dually weighted intermediate field representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel equivalences in random matrix and tensor models between complex and self-adjoint theories with nontrivial quadratic terms in the action, established through an intermediate field representation. More precisely, we show that the partition functions of certain self-adjoint models and their complex counterparts are different integral representations of the exact same function. A special case of these equivalences takes a form of newly found dually weighted intermediate field representations, which generalize the standard intermediate field representation. We also find indications of an equivalence between real tensor models and self-transpose tensor models.</description>

      <title>Granger Causality Maps for Langevin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wahl et al. (2016, 2017) introduced the idea of Granger causality (GC) maps for Langevin systems: dynamics are localised linearly at each point in phase space as vector Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (VOU) processes, for which GCs may in principle be calculated, thus constructing a GC map on phase space. Their implementation, however, suffered a significant drawback: GCs were approximated from models based on discrete-time stroboscopic sampling of local VOU processes, which is not only computationally inefficient, but more seriously, unfeasible on regions of phase space where local dynamics are unstable, leaving "holes" in the GC maps. We solve these problems by deriving an analytical expression for GC rates associated with a VOU process which, under quite general conditions, yields a meaningful solution even in the unstable case. Applied to GC maps, this not only "fills in the holes", but also furnishes a computationally efficient method of calculation devolving to solution of continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations which, in the case of a univariate source, become simple quadratic equations. We show, furthermore, that the GC rate for VOU processes is invariant under rescaling of the overall fluctuations intensity, so that GC maps may effectively be calculated for deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems, with a residual "ghost of noise" represented by a variance-covariance map.</description>

Abstract: We study the supermoduli space $\mathfrak {M}_{g,n,2r}$ of Super Riemann Surfaces (SRS) of genus $g$, with $n$ Neveu-Schwarz punctures and $2r$ Ramond punctures. We improve the result of Donagi, Witten, and Ott by showing that the supermoduli space $\mathfrak M_{g,n,2r}$ is not projected if $g\geq n+5r+3$.</description>

      <title>Fokas-type closed-form solution formulae for Sobolev-type equations with time-dependent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically derive novel explicit integral representations for the solution of nonhomogeneous initial-boundary-value problems for a large category of evolution partial differential equations of Sobolev-Galpern type with generic temporally variable coefficients, satisfying suitable mild conditions, and with arbitrary data in classical function spaces. This work is based on the careful implementation of the pioneering Fokas unified transform methodology alongside its recently-proposed extension for solving a class of linear evolution equations with dispersion relation of specific polynomial type and time-dependent coefficients. We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case. The new formulas are of utility in subsequent investigation of qualitative properties and analysis of nonlinear counterparts too. Further extensions, generalizations, rigorous aspects and implementations to other types of problems as well will soon be reported in forthcoming publications.</description>

      <title>Disks, Surfaces, and Entanglement Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability that a loop is null-homotopic -- that is, bounded by the continuous image of a disk -- in plaquette percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^3.$ Locally, the event that there is a ``horizontal disk crossing'' of a rectangular prism is dual to the event that there is a vertical crossing in entanglement percolation (with wired boundary conditions). However, the analysis of analogous events on the full lattice is complicated by the long-range nature of entanglement percolation. We show that the probability that a rectangular loop is contractible exhibits a phase transition from area law to perimeter law dual to the entanglement percolation threshold, conditional on a conjecture concerning the continuity of entanglement percolation thresholds with respect to truncation. We also show the continuity of a truncated entanglement percolation threshold in slabs and apply that to identify a regime where large plaquette surfaces exist but typically have many handles.</description>

      <title>The Use of Torsion in Supergravity Uplifts and Covariant Fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this Thesis is twofold. On the one hand, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 3D to be a solution of 11D supergravity (but the result is general and also holds for 10D supergravities), with 8 dimensions compactified into a coset space. The used method is based on the formalism of generalised geometry, useful for the study of dualities in string theory and supergravity. The analysis extends the known results to the case in which the duality group of the reduced theory is $E_{8(8)}$, whose generalised geometry is still little understood. On the other hand, we study properties of the so-called covariant fracton gauge theory, computing the BRST cohomology and consistent anomalies, and showing that its solutions describe a specific subsector of an extension of General Relativity, called Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. Covariant fracton theory is the gauge theory of a symmetric rank-2 tensor, invariant under gauge transformations depending on the second derivative of a scalar parameter, and is the Lorentz-covariant extension of the continuous limit of spin-chain theories admitting excitations with reduced mobility (called fractons), due to the conservation of the dipole moment. In both cases, the Weitzenb\"ock torsion plays a crucial r\^ole. The Thesis includes a self-contained review of the main notions needed to understand the original results, comprising, in addition to the already mentioned topics, duality in supergravity theories, the generalised Lie derivative, formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity suitable to reductions with duality groups given by exceptional Lie groups, salient aspects of three-dimensional gravity, and the BRST formalism for computing anomalies in field theories.</description>

      <title>Maximum Cluster Diameter in Non-Critical Bond Percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study independent (Bernoulli) bond percolation in dimensions $d \ge 2$, focusing on the maximum diameter of finite clusters in the non-critical regime ($p\neq p_c$). We prove that the maximum diameter $R_n$ satisfies $R_n / \log n \to \varkappa(p)$ almost surely, where $\varkappa(p)$ is determined by the exponential decay rate $\xi(p)$ of $P_p(0 \leftrightarrow \partial B_n, |\mathcal C_0|&lt;\infty)$. Furthermore, we establish a large deviation principle for the event $\{R_n &gt; \rho\log n\}$ for $\rho &gt; \varkappa (p)$. Finally, we consider the asymptotics of the number of vertices in clusters with large diameters.</description>

      <title>Emergence of higher-order interactions in systems of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms that govern collective synchronization is a paramount task in nonlinear dynamics. While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics.</description>

      <title>New methods to improve the decontamination of slitless spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes four new methods to decontaminate spectra of stars and galaxies resulting from slitless spectroscopy used in many space missions such as Euclid. These methods are based on two distinct approaches and simultaneously take into account multiple dispersion directions of light. The first approach, called the local instantaneous approach, is based on an approximate linear instantaneous model. The second approach, called the local convolutive approach, is based on a more realistic convolutive model that allows simultaneous decontamination and deconvolution of spectra. For each approach, a mixing model was developed that links the observed data to the source spectra. This was done either in the spatial domain for the local instantaneous approach or in the Fourier domain for the local convolutive approach. Four methods were then developed to decontaminate these spectra from the mixtures, exploiting the direct images provided by photometers. Test results obtained using realistic, noisy, Euclid-like data confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A new bound for the critical point of the FK model for $q&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the random cluster model with parameter $q&lt;1$, for which the FKG inequalities are not valid. On the square lattice, stochastic comparison with Bernoulli percolation implies that the model is subcritical (respectively supercritical) when $p \leq q/(1+q)$ (resp. $p \geq 1/2$); in this paper, we extend these two regions, by improving the classical stochastic comparisons. Assuming the existence of the critical point, this reduces its possible range.
  The proof relies on a modification of the usual Glauber dynamics of the model, which enables stochastic bounds of FK measures between two inhomegenous percolations. We also prove uniqueness of the infinite-volume measure in our extended ranges. Most of our results are valid in any dimension $d \geq 2$ and beyond hypercubic lattices.</description>

Abstract: The multidimensional Cauchy-Riemann operator provides a framework for studying higher order partial differential equations in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$, whose solutions include polymonogenic and polyharmonic functions, among others. In this work, we aim to explicitly construct solutions to such systems, generated from families of complex valued functions which are closed under conjugation and under the action of the complex Cauchy-Riemann operator. Moreover, we prove that precisely some of these solutions also satisfy homogeneous linear differential equations involving the so-called hypercomplex derivative.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a wave maps type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-time blowup for a nonlinear wave equation for maps from the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ into the 1-sphere $\mathbb{S}^1$, whose nonlinearity exhibits a null-form structure. We construct, for every dimension $d \geq 1$, a countable family of discretely self-similar blowup solutions, which are even for $d=1$ and radial for $d \geq 2$. The main contribution of the paper is a detailed nonlinear stability analysis of this family of solutions. For $d \geq 2$, we consider radial data, while in $d=1$ we allow for general perturbations. After linearizing around the self-similar profiles in similarity variables, we construct resolvents of the resulting highly non-self-adjoint operators through Liouville-Green transformations and precise Volterra-type asymptotics. The construction itself, which occupies most of the paper, is technically challenging, as it is performed in arbitrary dimensions and for a countable family of operators in each. Combined with a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operators, this yields sharp semigroup bounds and allows us to establish nonlinear stability of all discretely self-similar profiles in all dimensions, with precise co-dimension determined by the unstable spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a geometric wave equation.</description>

      <title>A Universal Geometric Framework for Black Hole Phase Transitions: From Multivaluedness to Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed synchronized multivalued behavior in thermodynamic, dynamical, and geometric quantities during the black hole first-order phase transition, which enables a diagnosis from different perspectives, yet its fundamental origin has remained poorly understood. By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Darboux transformations of the singular harmonic oscillator are considered. Analytical expressions for the propagators are obtained, using the image method applied to formal singular propagators. Two-well and three-well families of potentials and the corresponding propagators are presented. Axially symmetric magnetic field configurations corresponding to these potentials have been identified.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics a la Souriau on K\"ahler Non Compact Symmetric Spaces for Cartan Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify several issues concerning the abstract geometrical formulation of thermodynamics on non compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$ that are the mathematical model of hidden layers in the new paradigm of Cartan Neural Networks. We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {\`a} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the K\"ahler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\subset\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\mathbb{H}\subset\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincar\'e and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\mathrm{H}\subset \mathrm{U}$.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Quantum Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the traditional ways of introducing bosons and fermions is through creation and annihilation algebras. Historically, these have been associated with emission and absorption processes at the quantum level and are characteristic of the language of second quantization. In this work, we formulate the transition from first to second quantization by taking quotients of the state spaces of distinguishable particles, so that the resulting equivalence classes identify states that contain no information capable of distinguishing between particles, thereby generalising the usual symmetrisation procedure. Assuming that the resulting indistinguishable-particle space (i) admits an ordered basis compatible with how an observer may label the accessible modes, (ii) is invariant under unitary transformations of those modes, and (iii) supports particle counting as a mode-wise local operation, we derive a new class of creation-annihilation algebras. These algebras reproduce the partition functions of transtatistics-maximal generalisations of bosons and fermions consistent with these operational principles.</description>

      <title>Signatures of real-space geometry, topology, and metric tensor in quantum transport in periodically corrugated spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle constrained to a two-dimensional non-compact Riemannian manifold with non-trivial metric can be described by a flat-space Schroedinger-type equation at the cost of introducing local mass and metric and geometry-induced effective potential with no classical counterpart. For a metric tensor periodically modulated along one dimension, the formation of bands is demonstrated and transport-related quantities are derived. Using S-matrix approach, the quantum conductance along the manifold is calculated and contrasted with conventional quantum transport methods in flat spaces. The topology, e.g. whether the manifold is simply connected, compact or non-compact shows up in global, non-local properties such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The results vividly demonstrate emergent phenomena due to the interplay of reduced-dimensionality, particles quantum nature, geometry, and topology.</description>

      <title>Random purification channel for passive Gaussian bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random purification channel, which, given $n$ copies of an unknown mixed state $\rho$, prepares $n$ copies of an associated random purification, has proved to be an extremely valuable tool in quantum information theory. In this work, we construct a Gaussian version of this channel that, given $n$ copies of a bosonic passive Gaussian state, prepares $n$ copies of one of its randomly chosen Gaussian purifications. The construction has the additional advantage that each purification has a mean photon number which is exactly twice that of the initial state. Our construction relies on the characterisation of the commutant of passive Gaussian unitaries via the representation theory of dual reductive pairs of unitary groups.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled 2D Hubbard model at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U&gt;0$ and $t&gt;0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate harmonic analysis of random matrices of large size with their Dyson indices going simultaneous to zero, that is in the high temperature limit. In this regime, we show that the multivariate Bessel function/Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function of the empirical spectral distribution converges to the Fourier/Mellin transform of a measure, which and the limiting empirical distribution are intimately related by the Markov-Krein correspondence. The uniqueness, existence and other properties of the Markov-Krein correspondence can be studied using the theory of the Dirichlet process.</description>

      <title>Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a&lt;0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a&gt;0$. In this paper, we prove the conjecture under the additional condition that $3a&gt;\lambda$, which corresponds physically to the regime where vacancies, as opposed to misaligned dimers, are the dominant mechanism for decorrelation, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Characterising the sets of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H\subseteq L^2(\mathbb R)$ we consider the convex sets $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ of Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e.~density matrices over $\mathcal H$ with non-negative Wigner function. We investigate the topological structure of these sets, namely concerning closure, compactness, interior and boundary (in a relative topology induced by the trace norm). We also study their geometric structure and construct minimal sets of states that generate $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ through convex combinations. If $\mathcal H$ is finite-dimensional, the existence of such sets follows from a central result in convex analysis, namely the Krein-Milman theorem. In the infinite-dimensional case $\mathcal H=L^2(\mathbb R)$ this is not so, due to lack of compactness of the set $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$. Nevertheless, we prove that a Krein-Milman theorem holds in this case, which allows us to extend most of the results concerning the sets of generators to the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we study the relation between the finite and infinite-dimensional sets of WPS, and prove that the former provide a hierarchy of closed subsets, which are also proper faces of the latter. These results provide a basis for an operational characterisation of the extreme points of the sets of WPS, which we undertake in a companion paper. Our work offers a unified perspective on the topological and geometric properties of the sets of WPS in finite and infinite dimensions, along with explicit constructions of minimal sets of generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct C*-dynamical systems for the dynamics of classical infinite particle systems describing harmonic oscillators interacting with arbitrarily many neighbors on lattices, as well on more general structures. Our approach allows particles with varying masses, varying frequencies, irregularly placed lattice sites and varying interactions subject to a simple summability constraint. A key role is played by the commutative resolvent algebra, which is a C*-algebra of bounded continuous functions on an infinite dimensional vector space, and in a strong sense the classical limit of the Buchholz--Grundling resolvent algebra, which suggests that quantum analogs of our results are likely to exist. For a general class of Hamiltonians, we show that the commutative resolvent algebra is time-stable, and admits a time-stable sub-algebra on which the dynamics is strongly continuous, therefore obtaining a C*-dynamical system.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the derived equivalence between Calabi--Yau mixed branches using the B-brane hemisphere partition function in anomalous gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs). For a family of anomalous $U(2)$ GLSMs, we study the infrared behavior of B-branes under RG flow and the variation of FI parameters in the quantum K\"ahler moduli space. As characterized by the big and small window categories of the GLSM, the RG flow effect is analyzed according to the properties of their B-brane central charges as hemisphere partition functions. The result generalizes the band restriction rules in anomalous abelian GLSMs (Clingempeel--Floch--Romo) to some $U(2)$ models. As an application, we study a family of $U(1)\times U(k)$ models for $k=1,2$, which realize a Fano UV sigma model and two IR phases as mixed branches accompanied by local Calabi--Yau Higgs components. By applying the restriction rules, we establish new derived equivalences between Calabi--Yau varieties from these anomalous models.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry entails the Jordan algebra structure of finite-dimensional quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various approaches to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles. Discrete and continuous symmetries are under consideration. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices and a generalized version of Gleason's theorem for Jordan matrix algebras, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with three further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. The further requirements are: spectrality, a strong state space and a condition called gbit property.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of operators and wave propagation in high-contrast media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper aims to study the spectral properties of elliptic operators with highly inhomogeneous coefficients and related issues concerning wave propagation in high-contrast media. A unified approach to solving problems in bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, as well as in infinite periodic media, is proposed. For a small parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ characterizing the contrast of the components of the medium, the analyticity of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions is established in a neighborhood of $\varepsilon = 0$. Effective operators corresponding to $\varepsilon = 0$ are described.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Quantaloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to add a symmetric monoidal structure to quantaloids in a compatible way. In particular, dagger compact quantaloids turn out to have properties that are similar to the category Rel of sets and binary relations. Examples of such quantaloids are the category qRel of quantum sets and binary relations, and the category V-Rel of sets and binary relations with values in a commutative quantale V. For both examples, the process of internalization structures is of interest. Discrete quantization, a process of generalization of mathematical structures to the noncommutative setting can be regarded as the process of internalizing these structures in qRel, whereas fuzzification, the process of introducing degrees of truth or membership to concepts that are traditionally considered either true or false, can be regarded as the process of internalizing structures in V-Rel. Hence, we investigate how to internalize power sets and preordered structures in dagger compact quantaloids.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical-circuit data, in which the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method can recover the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as STLSQ, fail to do so with the available data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</description>

      <title>On a Generalized System with Applications to Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-time blowup of solutions $(u(x,t),b(x,t))$ to a generalized system of equations with applications to ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and one-dimensional fluid convection and stretching, among other areas, is investigated. The system is parameter-dependent, our spatial domain is the unit interval or the circle, and the initial data $(u_0(x),b_0(x))$ is assumed to be smooth. Among other results, we derive precise blowup criteria for specific values of the parameters by tracking the evolution of $u_x$ along Lagrangian trajectories that originate at a point $x_0$ at which $b_0(x)$ and $b_0'(x)$ vanish. We employ concavity arguments, energy estimates, and ODE comparison methods. We also show that for some values of the parameters, a non-vanishing $b_0'(x_0)$ suppresses finite-time blowup.</description>

      <title>Entanglement across scales: Quantics tensor trains as a natural framework for renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Non-Mean-Field Random Matrices in Dimensions $d\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $N \times N$ random band matrices $H = (H_{xy})$ with mean-zero complex Gaussian entries, where $x,y$ lie on the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. The variance profile satisfies $\mathbb{E}|H_{xy}|^2 = S_{xy}$, with $S_{xy} = 0$ whenever the distance between $x$ and $y$ exceeds a bandwidth parameter $W$. We prove that if $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$ for some constant $\mathfrak{c} &gt; 0$, then in the large-$N$ limit, bulk eigenvectors are delocalized, quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) holds, and the local bulk eigenvalue statistics are universal. Our proof is based on the tree approximation of the loop hierarchy (arXiv:2501.01718) and diagrammatic techniques developed in earlier works (arXiv:1807.02447, arXiv:2104.12048, arXiv:2107.05795, arXiv:2412.15207, arXiv:2503.07606).
  Besides random band matrices, we also study two classical non-mean-field random matrix models: the Wegner orbital and the block Anderson models. Specifically, we consider Hermitian matrices $H = V + g \Psi$ on the same discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$, where $V$ is a random block potential consisting of i.i.d. complex Gaussian diagonal blocks of size $W^d \times W^d$, and $\Psi$ encodes the interactions between neighboring blocks--random in the Wegner orbital model and deterministic in the block Anderson model. The parameter $g &gt; 0$ represents the coupling strength between blocks. Assuming again that $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$, we establish delocalization of bulk eigenvectors, QUE, and bulk universality under the condition $W^{-d/2+\varepsilon}\le g \le \varepsilon^{-1}$ for any small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Combined with the localization results of arXiv:1608.02922 for $g \ll W^{-d/2}$, this identifies a localization--delocalization transition at the scale $g=W^{-d/2}$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Boundary Actions and Loop Groups: A Geometric Picture of Gauge Symmetries at Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work arXiv:2407.13556, we proposed an extended phase space structure at null infinity accommodating large gauge symmetries for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems in Yang-Mills, via dressing fields arising in the Stueckelberg procedure. Here, we give an explicit boundary action controlling the dynamics of these fields. This allows for a derivation from first principles of the associated charges, together with an explicit renormalization procedure when taking the limit to null and spatial infinity, matching with charges proposed in previous work. Using the language of fibre bundles, we relate the existence of Stueckelberg fields to the notion of extension/reduction of the structure group of a principal bundle, thereby deriving their transformation rules in a natural way, thus realising them as Goldstone-like objects. Finally, this allows us to give a geometric picture of the gauge transformation structure at the boundary, via a loop group coming from formal expansions in the coordinate transversal to the boundary.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics Relative to a Quantum Reference System: a Relative State Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an intrinsic or background-independent quantum framework based on entangled state rather than absolute quantum state, it describes a quantum relative state between the under-study quantum system and the quantum measuring apparatus as a quantum reference system, without relying on any external absolute parameter. The paper focuses on a simple example, in which a quantum object's one-dimensional position as an under-study quantum system, and a quantum clock as a quantum reference system or quantum measuring apparatus. The evolution equation of the state of the quantum object's position with respect to the state of the quantum clock is given coming from the Ricci-flat Kaehler-Einstein equation. In a linear and non-relativistic approximation, the framework recovers the equation of the standard quantum mechanics, in which an intrinsic potential related to some "inertial force" is automatically incorporated in the covariant derivative. A physical relative probability interpretation and a geometric non-trivial fiber bundle interpretation of the entangled state in this intrinsic quantum framework are given. Furthermore, some non-inertial effects, such as the "inertial force", coming from the general covariance of the intrinsic quantum framework are also discussed. Compared with the functional integral approach which is more easily to generalize the quantum clock to the quantum spacetime reference frame and study quantum gravity, the relative state approach as a canonical description is more suitable for conceptually demonstrating the connections to the standard formalism and interpretation of the quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Folded optimal transport and its application to separable quantum optimal transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole convex, related to convex extension. This construction broadens the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case of the convex being a simplex. Relying on Choquet theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovich cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Franca [4], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. We also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [16] cost writes as a folded Kantorovich cost. Folded optimal transport therefore provides a unified framework for classical, semiclassical and separable quantum optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass in Interacting Elko and Scalar Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study \emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this letter is to compute the evolution of some expected values, such as the field operators $a^{\pm}$, quadratures and atomic inversion, under SUSY partner Hamiltonians associated to the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum optics. This kind of SUSY partners are characterized by having spectra which differ in a finite number of energy levels. We wish to elucidate if the partner connection has any influence on these expected values. In particular, we want also to know in which way the classical and revival times are affected by such SUSY partners.</description>
