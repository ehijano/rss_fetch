      <title>Quantum magnetic oscillations in the absence of closed electron trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnetic oscillations in crystals are typically understood in terms of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantisation, the frequency of oscillation is given by the area of a closed electron trajectory. However, since the 1970s, oscillations have been observed with frequencies that do not correspond to closed electron trajectories and this effect has remained not fully understood. Previous theory has focused on explaining the effect using various kinetic mechanisms, however, frequencies without a closed electron orbit have been observed in equilibrium and so a kinetic mechanism cannot be the entire story. In this work we develop a theory which explains these frequencies in equilibrium and can thus be used to understand measurements of both Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations. We show, analytically, that these frequencies arise due to multi-electron correlations. We then extend our theory to explain a recent experiment on artificial crystals in GaAs two-dimensional electron gases, which revealed for the first time magnetic oscillations having frequencies that are half of those previously observed. We show that the half-frequencies arise in equilibrium from single-particle dynamics with account of impurities. Our analytic results are reinforced by exact numerics, which we also use clarify prior works on the kinetic regime.</description>

      <title>Theory of local $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers for finite and periodic two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological phases of two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric insulators are classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological invariant. Usually, the invariant is introduced and calculated by exploiting the way time-reversal symmetry acts in reciprocal space, hence implicitly assuming periodicity and homogeneity. Here, we introduce two space-resolved $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers that are able to probe the local topology of the ground-state electronic structure also in the case of inhomogeneous and finite systems. The first approach leads to a generalized local spin-Chern marker, that usually remains well-defined also when the perpendicular component of the spin, $S_{z}$, is not conserved. The second marker is solely based on time-reversal symmetry, hence being more general. We validate our markers on the Kane-Mele model both in periodic and open boundary conditions, also in presence of disorder and including topological/trivial heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Quantized perfect transmission in graphene nanoribbons with random hollow adsorbates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurities exist inevitably in two-dimensional materials as they spontaneously adsorb onto the surface during fabrication, usually exerting detrimental effects on electronic transport. Here, we focus on a special type of impurities that preferentially adsorb onto the hollow regions of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), and study how they affect the quantum transport in GNRs. Contrary to previous knowledge that random adatoms should localize electrons, the so-called Anderson localization, noteworthy quantized conductance peaks (QCPs) are observed at specific electron energies. These QCPs are remarkably robust against variations in system size, GNR edge, and adatom properties, and they can reappear at identical energies following an arithmetic sequence of device width. Further investigation of wavefunction reveals a unique transport mode at each QCP energy which transmits through disordered GNRs reflectionlessly, while all the others become fully Anderson localized, indicating the survival of quantum ballistic transport in the localized regime. Our findings highlight the potential utility of hollow adatoms as a powerful tool to manipulate the conductivity of GNRs, and deepen the understanding of the interplay between impurities and graphene.</description>

      <title>Hidden order in dielectrics: string condensation, solitons, and the charge-vortex duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Description of electrons as solitons of the polarization field implies that an ordinary dielectric has a hidden order, associated with the invariance with respect to adding loops of quantized electric flux. We describe the mechanism by which the finite polarizability of the medium renders the interaction between the solitons short-ranged (prior to their coupling to electromagnetism) and argue that the structure of the solitons allows them to be quantized as either fermions or bosons. At the quantum level, the theory has, in addition to the solitonic electric, elementary magnetic excitations, suggesting that small dielectrics may host quantized magnetic vortices carrying circular polarization currents.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Nonlinear Responses in the Nonequilibrium States: Moving Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity. Our work demonstrates not only nonreciprocal nonlinear responses in nonequilibrium states but also the application of Galilean transformation in simplifying time-dependent problems.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Induced Topological Phase Transition in Inverted InAs/GaSb Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a magneto-induced topological phase transition in inverted InAs/GaSb bilayers from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a normal insulator. We utilize a dual-gated Corbino device in which the degree of band inversion, or equivalently the electron and hole densities, can be continuously tuned. We observe a topological phase transition around the magnetic field where a band crossing occurs, that is accompanied by a bulk-gap closure characterized by a bulk conductance peak (BCP). In another set of experiments, we study the transition under a tilted magnetic field (tilt angle $\theta$). We observe the characteristic magneto-conductance around BCP as a function of $\theta$, which dramatically depends on the density of the bilayers. In a relatively deep-inversion (hence a higher density) regime, where the electron-hole hybridization dominates the excitonic interaction, the BCP grows with $\theta$. On the contrary, in a shallowly-inverted (a lower density) regime, where the excitonic interaction dominates the hybridization, the BCP is suppressed indicating a smooth crossover without a gap closure. This suggests the existence of a low-density, correlated insulator with spontaneous symmetry breaking near the critical point. Our highly controllable electron-hole system offers an ideal platform to study interacting topological states as proposed by recent theories.</description>

      <title>QArray: a GPU-accelerated constant capacitance model simulator for large quantum dot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot arrays are a leading architecture for the development of quantum technologies. Over the years, the constant capacitance model has served as a fundamental framework for simulating, understanding, and navigating the charge stability diagrams of small quantum dot arrays. However, while the size of the arrays keeps growing, solving the constant capacitance model becomes computationally prohibitive. This paper presents an open-source software package able to compute a $100 \times 100$ pixels charge stability diagram of a 16-dot array in less than a second. Smaller arrays can be simulated in milliseconds - faster than they could be measured experimentally, enabling the creation of diverse datasets for training machine learning models and the creation of digital twins that can interface with quantum dot devices in real-time. Our software package implements its core functionalities in the systems programming language Rust and the high-performance numerical computing library JAX. The Rust implementation benefits from advanced optimisations and parallelisation, enabling the users to take full advantage of multi-core processors. The JAX implementation allows for GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>Cryogen-free modular scanning tunneling microscope operating at 4-K in high magnetic field on a compact ultra-high vacuum platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the daunting challenges in modern low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is the difficulty of combining atomic resolution with cryogen free cooling. Further functionality needs, such as ultra-high vacuum (UHV), high magnetic field, and compatibility with {\mu}m-sized samples, pose additional challenges to an already ambitious build. We present the design, construction, and performance of a cryogen free, UHV, low temperature, and high magnetic field system for modular STM operation. An internal vibration isolator reduces vibrations in this system allowing atomic resolution STM imaging while maintaining a low base temperature of ~4K and magnetic fields up to 9T. Samples and tips can be conditioned in-situ utilizing a heating stage, an ion sputtering gun, an e-beam evaporator, a tip treater, and sample exfoliation. In-situ sample and tip exchange and alignment are performed in a connected UHV room temperature stage with optical access. Multisite operation without breaking vacuum is enabled by a unique quick-connect STM head design. A novel low-profile vertical transfer mechanism permits transferring the STM between room temperature and the low temperature cryostat.</description>

      <title>Effect of nonlocal interlayer hopping on wave function in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional low-energy theory employed to describe twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) relies on a local interlayer Hamiltonian. According to this theory, TBG has the same linear-in-momentum dispersion and spinor wave function at the Dirac point as single-layer graphene (SLG), albeit with a renormalized velocity that decreases as the rotation angle between the layers decreases, eventually reaching zero at the magic angle. In this work, I expand upon this low-energy theory by including nonlocal terms in the interlayer part of the Hamiltonian, and explore the consequences at the Dirac point. It is found that the nonlocality predominantly influences the wave function rather than the energy spectrum: despite the persistence of the linear-in-momentum dispersion with a renormalized velocity, the wave functions no longer mirror those of SLG. Instead, an additional contribution to the phase difference between the sublattice components of the spinor emerges. This gives rise to interesting effects in scattering which are demonstrated with a simple example.</description>

      <title>Probing the Anisotropic Fermi Surface in Tetralayer Graphene via Transverse Magnetic Focusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bernal-stacked tetralayer graphene (4LG) exhibits intriguing low-energy properties, featuring two massive subbands and showcasing diverse features of topologically distinct, anisotropic Fermi surfaces, including Lifshitz transitions and trigonal warping. Here, we study the influence of the band structure on electron dynamics within 4LG using transverse magnetic focusing. Our analysis reveals two distinct focusing peaks corresponding to the two subbands. Furthermore, we uncover a pronounced dependence of the focusing spectra on crystal orientations, indicative of an anisotropic Fermi surface. Utilizing the semiclassical model, we attribute this orientation-dependent behavior to the trigonal warping of the band structure. This phenomenon leads to variations in electron trajectories based on crystal orientation. Our findings not only enhance our understanding of the dynamics of electrons in 4LG, but also offer a promising method for probing anisotropic Fermi surfaces in other materials.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e superlattices of antimonene on a Bi(111) substrate with van Hove singularity and Rashba-type spin polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices consisting of two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted immense attention because of emergent phenomena such as flat band-induced Mott insulating states and unconventional superconductivity. However, the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on them have not been fully explored yet. Here we show that single- and double-bilayer (BL) Sb honeycomb lattices, referred to as antimonene, forms moir\'e superlattices on a Bi(111) substrate due to a lattice mismatch. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal the presence of spectral peaks near the Fermi level, which are spatially modulated with the moir\'e period. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarifies the surface band structure with saddle points near the Fermi level, which allows us to attribute the observed STM spectral peaks to the van Hove singularity. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements also shows that the observed surface states are Rashba-type spin-polarized. The present work has significant implications that Fermi surface instability and symmetry breaking may emerge at low temperatures, where spin degree of freedom and electron correlation will also play important roles.</description>

      <title>Probing Plexciton Emission from 2D Materials on Gold Nanotrenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing strongly coupled quasiparticle excitations at their intrinsic length scales offers unique insights into their properties and facilitates the design of devices with novel functionalities. In this work, we investigate the formation and emission characteristics of plexcitons, arising from the interaction between surface plasmons in narrow gold nanotrenches and excitons in monolayer WSe2. We study this strong plasmon-exciton coupling in both the far-field and the near-field. Specifically, we observe a Rabi splitting in the far-field reflection spectra of about 80 meV under ambient conditions, consistent with our theoretical modeling. Using a custom-designed near-field probe, we find that plexciton emission originates predominantly from the lower-frequency branch, which we can directly probe and map the local field distribution. We precisely determine the plexciton extension, similar to the trench width, with nanometric precision via collecting spectra at controlled probe locations. Our work opens exciting prospects for nanoscale mapping and engineering of plexcitons in complex nanostructures with potential applications in nanophotonic devices, optoelectronics, and quantum electrodynamics in nanoscale cavities.</description>

      <title>Proximity-Induced Exchange Interaction: a New Pathway for Quantum Sensing using Spin Centers in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional van der Waals material, have raised wide range interest for its potential in various quantum applications. Due to hBN's 2D nature, spin center in hBN can be engineered in close proximity to target material, providing advantages over their 3D counterparts, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Here we propose a novel quantum sensing protocol driven by exchange interaction between spin center in hBN and the underlying magnetic substrate induced by magnetic proximity effect. By first-principle calculation, we demonstrate the induced exchange interaction dominates over dipole-dipole interaction by orders of magnitude when in proximity. The interaction remains antiferromagnetic across all stacking configuration between the spin center in hBN and the target van der Waals magnets. Additionally, we explored the scaling behavior of the exchange field as a function of the spatial separation between the spin center and the targets.</description>

      <title>Hidden charge density wave induced shadow bands and ultrafast dynamics of CuTe investigated using time-resolved ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the fine electronic structure is critical for understanding the underlying physics of low-dimensional materials. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful experimental technique for mapping out the experimental electronic structure. By reducing the photon energy (e.g. to 6 eV) using laser sources, a greatly improved momentum resolution can be achieved, thereby providing opportunities for ``zooming in'' the fine electronic structure and even revealing the previously unresolvable bands near the Brillouin zone center. Here, by using quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe as an example, we demonstrate the unique capability of laser-based ARPES in revealing the fine electronic structures of ``hidden'' charge density wave induced shadow bands near the Brillouin zone center, which are previously unresolvable using synchrotron sources. The observation of the shadow bands reveals the CDW phase from the aspect of band folding, and the unpredicted CDW band hybridization strongly modifies the electronic structure and Fermi surface, which suggests that such hybridization must be taken into account for studying the CDW transition. Moreover, the ultrafast non-equilibrium carrier dynamics are captured by time-resolved ARPES, revealing the relaxation dynamics through electron-phonon scattering. Our work demonstrates the advantages of laser-based ARPES in zooming in the fine electronic structures, as well as capturing the ultrafast dynamics of low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Optical spin orientation of localized electrons and holes interacting with nuclei in an FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical orientation of carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the basic concept and tool of spin physics in semiconductors. We study the optical orientation of electrons and holes in a crystal of the FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ lead halide perovskite by means of polarized photoluminescence, time-resolved differential reflectivity, and time-resolved Kerr rotation. At the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K the optical orientation degree measured for continuous-wave excitaton reaches 6\% for localized electrons and 2\% for localized holes. Their contributions are distinguished from each other and from exciton optical orientation through the pronounced Hanle effect in transverse magnetic fields and the polarization recovery effect in longitudinal magnetic fields. The optical orientation degree is highly stable against detuning of the laser photon energy from the band gap by up to 0.25 eV, showing then a gradual decrease for detunings up to 0.9 eV. This evidences the inefficiency of spin relaxation mechanisms for free carriers during their energy relaxation. Spin relaxation for localized electrons and holes is provided by the hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins. Dynamic polarization of nuclear spins is demonstrated by the Overhauser field reaching 4 mT acting on the electrons and $-76$ mT acting on the holes. This confirms the specifics of lead halide perovskite semiconductors, where the hole hyperfine interaction with the nuclei considerably exceeds that of the electron.</description>

      <title>Valley edge states as bound states in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized states with energy embedded in the continuum spectrum of extended states. The combination of BICs physics and nontrivial band topology theory giving rise to topological BICs, which are robust against disorders and meanwhile of the merit of conventional BICs, is attracting wide attention recently. Here, we report valley edge states as topological BICs, which appear at domain wall between two distinct valley topological phases. The robustness of such BICs is demonstrated. The simulations and experiments show great agreement. Our findings of valley related topological BICs shed light on both BICs and valley physics, and may foster innovative applications of topological acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Raman scattering by carbon nanotubes coupled to quantum dots via dipolar excitonic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dipole-dipole interactions between excitons are of paramount importance in the nanoscale structures. When two excitons are placed together they can exchange the energy can manifest in the resonant Raman cross sections. We provide theoretical framework for such effects by combining the coupled oscillator model and perturbation theory. We apply this theory to a hybrid film comprising semiconducting quantum dots and metallic carbon nanotubes. The quantum dots exciton has a fixed energy, while the nanotube resonances span across a larger range from 1.7 to \SI{1.93}{eV}. We acquire the resonant Raman profiles of the pristine nanotubes and hybrids and find a relative shift between them. The shift direction depends on the relative energies between the CNT and QD exciton energies, as predicted by our theory.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum dynamics of spin-orbit coupled Andreev states in a Zeeman field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the quantum many-body dynamics of Andreev states in Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic Zeeman field. In such cases, employing a doubled Nambu spinor description is technically advantageous but one then has to be careful to avoid double-counting problems. By deriving the Lindblad master equation in the socalled excitation picture, we show that a physically consistent many-body theory free from doublecounting problems follows. We apply our formalism to a study of dynamical parity stabilization of the Andreev sector at intermediate times after an initial microwave pulse, in particular addressing the combined effects of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field.</description>

      <title>Observation of dichotomic field-tunable electronic structure in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) provides a fascinating platform for engineering flat bands and inducing correlated phenomena. By designing the stacking architecture of graphene layers, twisted multilayer graphene can exhibit different symmetries with rich tunability. For example, in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) which breaks the C2z symmetry, transport measurements reveal an asymmetric phase diagram under an out-of-plane electric field, exhibiting correlated insulating state and ferromagnetic state respectively when reversing the field direction. Revealing how the electronic structure evolves with electric field is critical for providing a better understanding of such asymmetric field-tunable properties. Here we report the experimental observation of field-tunable dichotomic electronic structure of tMBG by nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES) with operando gating. Interestingly, selective enhancement of the relative spectral weight contributions from monolayer and bilayer graphene is observed when switching the polarity of the bias voltage. Combining experimental results with theoretical calculations, the origin of such field-tunable electronic structure, resembling either tBLG or twisted double-bilayer graphene (tDBG), is attributed to the selectively enhanced contribution from different stacking graphene layers with a strong electron-hole asymmetry. Our work provides electronic structure insights for understanding the rich field-tunable physics of tMBG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the celebrated Stern-Gerlach experiment an inhomogeneous static magnetic field separates a beam of charge-neutral atoms with opposite spins, thereby driving a ``spin current" normal to the propagation direction. Here we generalize it to the dynamic scenario by demonstrating a spin transfer between an AC inhomogeneous magnetic field and intraband electrons or charge-neutral excitons and phonons. We predict that parametric pumping can efficiently radiate their DC spin currents from local AC magnetic sources with van der Waals semiconductors as prototypes. This mechanism brings a unified and efficient paradigm in the spin transport of distinct mobile carriers.</description>

      <title>Spin conductances and magnetization production in chiral molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental reports on chirality induced spin selectivity, we investigate a minimal model that allows us to calculate the charge and spin conductances through helical molecules analytically. The spin-orbit interaction is assumed to be non-vanishing on the molecule and negligible in the reservoirs (leads). The band-structure of the molecule features four helical modes with spin-momentum locking that are analogous of edge-currents in the quantum spin Hall effect. While charge is conserved and therefore the charge current is independent of where it is measured, - reservoirs or molecule, - our detailed calculations reveal that the spin currents in the left and right lead are equal in magnitudes but with opposite signs (in linear response).
  We predict that transport currents flowing through helical molecules are accompanied by a spin accumulation in the contact region with the same magnetization direction for source and drain. Further, we predict that the spin-conductance can be extracted directly from measuring the (quasi-static) spin accumulation - rather than the spin current itself, which is very challenging to obtain experimentally.</description>

      <title>Infrared Spectroscopy for Diagnosing Superlattice Minibands in Magic-angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) represents a highly tunable, strongly correlated electron system owed to its unique flat electronic bands. However, understanding the single-particle band structure alone has been challenging due to complex lattice reconstruction effects and a lack of spectroscopic measurements over a broad energy range. Here, we probe the band structure of TBG around the magic angle using infrared spectroscopy. Our measurements reveal spectral features originating from interband transitions whose energies are uniquely defined by the twist angle. By combining with quantum transport, we connect spectral features over a broad energy range (10 to 700 meV) spanning several superlattice minibands and track their evolution with twist angle. We compare our data with calculations of the band structures obtained via the continuum model and find good agreement only when considering a variation of interlayer/intralayer tunnelling parameters with the twist angle. Our analysis suggests that the magic angle also shifts due to lattice relaxation, and is better defined for a wide angular range from 0.9{\deg} to 1.1{\deg}. Our work provides spectroscopic insights into TBG's band structure and offers an optical fingerprint of the magic angle for screening heterostructures before nanofabrication.</description>

      <title>The inverse Faraday effect at Mie resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, dielectric nanophotonics enables almost lossless resonant interaction between light and matter at the nanoscale. We show both theoretically and by electromagnetic simulations, that the peculiar nature of Mie-resonance induced effective magnetic fields contrasts sharply with the optomagnetism of smooth bulk materials. Mie resonances produce strongly nonuniform effective magnetic fields generated by the inverse Faraday effect. Different orders of optical resonances are characterized by different types of the effective magnetic field patterns. The number of point-like inverse Faraday effect sources can be controlled by adjusting the pump wavelength, allowing for the selective launch of spin waves with submicron wavelengths. A distinguish feature of the Mie-resonance-induced effective magnetic fields is the vortex structure that can be used for the magnetic skyrmion generation. The proposed approach considerably broadens the scope of nanoscale optomagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic systems leverage gain and loss to open new directions for nanophotonic technologies. However, the quantum and thermal noise intrinsically associated with gain/loss affects the eigenvalue/eigenvector structure of NH systems, as well as its practical noise performance. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the impact of different gain and loss mechanisms on the noise generated in gain-loss compensated NH waveguide systems. Our results highlight important differences in the eigenvalue/eigenvector structure, noise power, photon statistics and squeezing. At the same time, we identify some universal properties such as gain-loss compensation, broken to unbroken phase transitions, coalesce of pairs of eigenvectors, and linear scaling of the noise with the length of the waveguide. We believe that these results provide a more global understanding on the impact of the gain/loss mechanism on the noise generated in NH systems.</description>

      <title>Inducing a Metal-Insulator Transition through Systematic Alterations of Local Rewriting Rules in a Quantum Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson localization transition in quantum graphs has garnered significant recent attention due to its relevance to many-body localization studies. Typically, graphs are constructed using top-down methods. Here, we explore a bottom-up approach, employing a simple local rewriting rule to construct the graph. Through the use of ratio statistics for the energy spectrum and Kullback-Leibler divergence correlations for the eigenstates, numerical analysis demonstrates that slight adjustments to the rewriting rule can induce a transition from a localized to an extended quantum phase. This extended state exhibits non-ergodic behavior, akin to the non-ergodic extended phase observed in the Porter-Rosenzweig model and suggested for many-body localization. Thus, by adapting straightforward local rewriting rules, it becomes feasible to assemble complex graphs from which desired global quantum phases emerge. This approach holds promise for numerical investigations and could be implemented in building optical realizations of complex networks using optical fibers and beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Two-photon Interference of Single Photons with Ultralong Coherence Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon interference (TPI) is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum optics and plays a crucial role in quantum information science and technology. TPI is commonly considered as quantum interference with an upper bound of $100\%$ for both the TPI visibility and the beat visibility in contrast to its classical counterpart with a maximum visibility of $50\%$. However, this is not always the case. Here we report a simultaneous observation of quantum and classical TPI of single photons with ultralong coherence time which is longer than the photon correlation time by five orders of magnitude. We observe a TPI visibility of $94.3\%\pm 0.2\%$ but a beat visibility of $50\%$. Besides an anti-bunching central dip due to single-photon statistics, we observe two bunching side peaks in cross-correlation curves for indistinguishable photons. Using either classical wave superposition theory or quantum field approach, we derive the same expressions for the cross-correlation functions which reproduce and explain the experiments well. We conclude that quantum TPI with a stream of single photons is equivalent to classical TPI, both of which are the fourth-order interference arising from the second-order interference occurring on the time scale of photon coherence time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of superconducting electronics requires careful characterization of the components that make up electronic circuits. Superconducting weak links are the building blocks of most superconducting electronics components and are characterized by highly nonlinear current-to-phase relations (CPR), which are often not perfectly known. Recent research has found that the Josephson diode effect (JDE) can be related to the high harmonic content of the current-to-phase relation of the weak links embedded in superconducting interferometers. This makes the JDE a natural tool for exploring the harmonic content of weak links beyond single-harmonic CPR. In this study, we present the theoretical model and experimental characterization of a double-loop superconducting quantum interference device (DL-SQUID) that embeds all-metallic superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junctions. The proposed device exhibits the JDE due to the interference of the supercurrents of three weak links in parallel, and this feature can be adjusted through two magnetic fluxes, which act as experimental knobs. We carry out a theoretical study of the device in terms of the relative weight of the interferometer arms and the experimental characterization concerning flux tunability and temperature.</description>

      <title>Higher Landau-Level Analogues and Signatures of Non-Abelian States in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in moir\'e superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$), recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C = 1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our Wannier-based approach in modelling moir\'e superlattices is faithful to DFT wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of nonlinear phase space filling in polaritonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a full microscopic theory for a nonlinear phase space filling (NPSF) in strongly coupled two-dimensional polaritonic lattices. Ubiquitous in polaritonic experiments, the theoretical description of NPSF, remains limited to perturbative treatment and homogeneous samples. In this study, we go beyond the existing theoretical description and discover the broad scope of regimes where NPSF crucially modifies the optical response. Studying the quantum effects of non-bosonicity, cooperative light-matter coupling, and Coulomb blockade, we reveal several regimes for observing the nonlinear Rabi splitting quench due to the phase space filling. Unlike prior studies, we derive nonlinear Rabi frequency scaling all the way to the saturation limit and show that the presence of a lattice potential leads to qualitatively distinct nonlinearity. We concentrate on three regimes of NPSF: 1) planar; 2) fractured; and 3) ultralocalized. In planar saturation, the Rabi frequency decreases exponentially as a function of exciton density. For the fractured case, where excitons form a lattice with sites exceeding the exciton size, we discover fast NPSF at low occupation in the lattice. This is followed by slower NPSF as the medium becomes fully saturated. This behavior is particularly pronounced in the presence of Coulomb (or Rydberg) blockade, where regions of fast and slow NPSF depend on the strength of repulsion. For the ultralocalized NPSF, we observe the square-root saturation typical to the collection of two-level systems. Our findings can help describing recent observations of strong nonlinearity in heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides where Moir{\'e} lattices emerge naturally [Nature \textbf{591}, 61 (2021)]. The theory also opens the prospects for engineering strongly nonlinear responses of polaritonic lattices with patterned samples, driving polaritonics into the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect Sign Change in Epitaxial Al-InAs Josepshon Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has recently been a surge of interest in studying the superconducting diode effect (SDE) partly due to the possibility of uncovering the intrinsic properties of a material system. A change of sign of the SDE at finite magnetic field has previously been attributed to different mechanisms. Here, we observe the SDE in epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We show that this effect strongly depends on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, we observe a change of sign in the SDE. Simulation and measurement of supercurrent suggest that depending on the superconducting widths, $W_\text{S}$, this sign change may not necessarily be related to 0--$\pi$ or topological transitions. We find that the strongest sign change in junctions with narrow $W_\text{S}$ is consistent with SOC-induced asymmetry of the critical current under magnetic-field inversion, while in wider $W_\text{S}$, the sign reversal could be related to 0--$\pi$ transitions and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>CVD Graphene Contacts for Lateral Heterostructure MoS${_2}$ Field Effect Transistors</title>

Abstract: Intensive research is carried out on two-dimensional materials, in particular molybdenum disulfide, towards high-performance transistors for integrated circuits. Fabricating transistors with ohmic contacts is challenging due to the high Schottky barrier that severely limits the transistors' performance. Graphene-based heterostructures can be used in addition or as a substitute for unsuitable metals. We present lateral heterostructure transistors made of scalable chemical vapor-deposited molybdenum disulfide and chemical vapor-deposited graphene with low contact resistances of about 9 k${\Omega}$${\mu}$m and high on/off current ratios of 10${^8}$. We also present a theoretical model calibrated on our experiments showing further potential for scaling transistors and contact areas into the few nanometers range and the possibility of a strong performance enhancement by means of layer optimizations that would make transistors promising for use in future logic circuits.</description>

      <title>Chirality probe of twisted bilayer graphene in the linear transport regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose minimal transport experiments in the coherent regime that can probe the chirality of twisted moir\'e structures. We show that only with a third contact and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field (or other time-reversal symmetry breaking effect), a chiral system may display non-reciprocal transport in the linear regime. We then propose to use the third lead as a voltage probe and show that opposite enantiomers give rise to different voltage drops on the third lead. Additionally, in the scenario of layer-discriminating contacts, the third lead can serve as a current probe, capable of detecting different handedness even in the absence of a magnetic field. In a complementary configuration, applying opposite voltages on the two layers of the third leads gives rise to a chiral (super)current in the absence of a source-drain voltage whose direction is determined by its chirality.</description>

      <title>A spin-rotation mechanism of Einstein-de Haas effect based on a ferromagnetic disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-rotation coupling (SRC) is a fundamental phenomenon that connects electronic spins with the rotational motion of a medium. We elucidate the Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect and its inverse with SRC as the microscopic mechanism using the dynamic spin-lattice equations derived by elasticity theory and Lagrangian formalism. By applying the coupling equations to an iron disk in a magnetic field, we exhibit the transfer of angular momentum and energy between spins and lattice, with or without damping. The timescale of the angular momentum transfer from spins to the entire lattice is estimated by our theory to be on the order of 0.01 ns, for the disk with a radius of 100 nm. Moreover, we discover a linear relationship between the magnetic field strength and the rotation frequency, which is also enhanced by a higher ratio of Young's modulus to Poisson's coefficient. In the presence of damping, we notice that the spin-lattice relaxation time is nearly inversely proportional to the magnetic field. Our explorations will contribute to a better understanding of the EdH effect and provide valuable insights for magneto-mechanical manufacturing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced tensor network numerical methods are used to explore the fidelity of repeated SWAP operations on a system comprising 20-100 quantum dot spin qubits in the presence of valley leakage and electrostatic crosstalk. The fidelity of SWAP gates is largely unaffected by Zeeman splitting and valley splitting, except when these parameters come into resonance. The fidelity remains independent of the overall valley phase for valley eigenstates, while for generic valley states, some minor corrections arise. We analyze the fidelity scaling for long qubit chains without valley effects, where crosstalk represents the only error source.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical diode effect in a magnetic Weyl semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diode effects are of great interest for both fundamental physics and modern technologies. Electrical diode effects (nonreciprocal transport) have been observed in Weyl systems. Optical diode effects arising from the Weyl fermions have been theoretically considered but not probed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of a nonlinear optical diode effect (NODE) in the magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi, where the magnetization introduces a pronounced directionality in the nonlinear optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). We show demonstrate a six-fold change of the measured SHG intensity between opposite propagation directions over a bandwidth exceeding 250 meV. Supported by density-functional theory, we establish the linearly dispersive bands emerging from Weyl nodes as the origin of this broadband effect. We further demonstrate current-induced magnetization switching and thus electrical control of the NODE. Our results advance ongoing research to identify novel nonlinear optical/transport phenomena in magnetic topological materials and further opens new pathways for the unidirectional manipulation of light.</description>

Abstract: Controlling interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures holds promise for exploring Bose-Einstein condensates and developing novel optoelectronic applications, such as excitonic integrated circuits. Despite intensive studies, several key fundamental properties of interlayer excitons, such as their binding energies and interactions with charges, remain not well understood. Here we report the formation of momentum-direct interlayer excitons in a high-quality MoSe2/hBN/MoSe2 heterostructure under an electric field, characterized by bright photoluminescence (PL) emission with high quantum yield and a narrow linewidth of less than 4 meV. These interlayer excitons show electrically tunable emission energy spanning ~180 meV through the Stark effect, and exhibit a sizable binding energy of ~81 meV in the intrinsic regime, along with trion binding energies of a few millielectronvolts. Remarkably, we demonstrate the long-range transport of interlayer excitons with a characteristic diffusion length exceeding ten micrometers, which can be attributed, in part, to their dipolar repulsive interactions. Spatially and polarization-resolved spectroscopic studies reveal rich exciton physics in the system, such as valley polarization, local trapping, and the possible existence of dark interlayer excitons. The formation and transport of tightly bound interlayer excitons with narrow linewidth, coupled with the ability to electrically manipulate their properties, open exciting new avenues for exploring quantum many-body physics, including excitonic condensate and superfluidity, and for developing novel optoelectronic devices, such as exciton and photon routers.</description>

Abstract: Chirality as internal degree of freedom of a mesoscopic domain wall inside a quasi-one-dimensional fixture can be controlled by spin-polarized current for ferro- as well as anti-ferro-magnetic domain walls. We show that the current density required for the chirality manipulation can be significantly reduced in the low-temperature regime where the chirality dynamics exhibits quantum effects. In this quantum regime, weak currents can excite Bloch oscillations of the domain wall angular rotation velocity, with the oscillation frequency proportional to the current, modulated by a much higher magnon-range frequency. In addition to that, the Wannier-Stark localization effects enable controlled switching between different chiral states, suppressing inertial effects characteristic for the classical regime. We also show that for recently discovered novel class of magnetic materials -- altermagnets -- chirality switching can be driven by the usual charge current (not spin-polarized).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) is a powerful technique for investigating quantum phases appearing in two-dimensional electron systems. The electrons respond to the piezoelectric field of SAWthrough screening, attenuating its amplitude and shifting its velocity, which is described by the relaxation model. In this work, we systematically study this interaction using orders of magnitude lower SAW amplitude than that in previous studies. At high magnetic fields when electrons form highly correlated states such as the quantum Hall effect, we observe an anomalously large attenuation of SAW while the acoustic speed remains considerably high, inconsistent with the conventional relaxation model. This anomaly exists only when the SAW power is sufficiently low.</description>

Abstract: Fu and Kane have taught us that a Majorana zero-mode appears on the quantum spin Hall edge at the interface with a superconductor. If a magnetic scatterer is placed on the edge, the zero-point energy of massless edge excitations exerts a force on the scatterer. This is the fermionic analogue of the electromagnetic Casimir effect. We show that the Majorana zero-mode produces a repulsive Casimir force, pushing the scatterer away from the superconductor. Unlike some other signatures of Majorana zero-modes, the repulsive Casimir force is directly tied to the topological invariant of the system (the sign of the determinant of the reflection matrix from the superconductor).</description>

Abstract: Decades ago, Gurzhi proposed that if momentum-conserving collisions prevail among heat-carrying phonons in insulators and charge-carrying electrons in metals, hydrodynamic features will become detectable. In this paper, we will review the experimental evidence emerging in the last few years supporting this viewpoint and raising new questions. The focus of the paper will be bulk crystals without (or with a very dilute concentration) of mobile electrons and steady-state thermal transport. We will also discuss the possible link between this field of investigation and other phenomena, such as the hybridization of phonon modes and the phonon thermal Hall effect.</description>

Abstract: We address the precise determination of the phase diagram of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene under hydrostatic pressure within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock method in real space, including all the remote bands of the system. We further present a novel algorithm that maps the full real-space density matrix to a reduced density matrix based on a $SU(4)$ symmetry of sublattice and valley degrees of freedom. We find a quantum critical point between a nematic and a Kekul\'e phase, and show also that our microscopic approach displays a strong particle-hole asymmetry in the weak coupling regime. We arrive then at the prediction that the superconductivity should be Ising-like in the hole-doped nematic regime, with spin-valley locking, and spin-triplet in the electron-doped regime.</description>

      <title>Experimental testing of the Prandtl-Tomlinson model: Molecular origin of rotational friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural superlubricity, one of the most important concepts in modern tribology, has attracted lots of interest in both fundamental research and practical applications. However, the underlying model, known as the Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model, is oversimplified and not for real processes, despite its prevalence in frictional and structural lubricant studies. Here, with a realistic system, cholesteric liquid crystals, confined between two atomically smooth surfaces, we measure both the surface torque during rotational friction and the molecular rotation from the commensurate to incommensurate configuration at the onset of structural lubricity. Furthermore, by changing the surface potential or the strain, the Aubry transition is confirmed. The results agree well with the description by a quasi-one-dimensional version of the PT model and provide molecular evidence for rupture nucleation during static friction. Our study bridges the gap between theories and experiments and reinforces the connection between friction and fracture.</description>

      <title>Quantum-well resonances caused by partial confinement in MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-well resonance is achieved through partial confinement in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which provides an additional operable degree of freedom to regulate quantum-well levels. Using Al/Fe/MgO/Fe/Al and Ag/Al/Fe/MgO/Fe/Al/Ag MTJs as examples, via first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the partial confinement of $\Delta_1$ electron at Al/Fe interface and the full confinement at Fe/MgO interface combine to produce quantum-well resonances in Fe. The quantum-well levels of Fe can be periodically adjusted by two degrees of freedom: Fe and Al thickness. The oscillation period obtained from conductance $G_{\uparrow\uparrow}$ is 2.13 ML Fe (9 ML Al), close to 2.25 ML Fe (8.33 ML Al) calculated by bcc-Fe (fcc-Al) band. The combination of long and short periods enables quantum-well levels to be finely adjusted. An ultrahigh optimistic TMR effect of $3.05\times10$$^5$\% is achieved. Our results provides a new path for designing and applying quantum-well resonances in spintronics devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a systemic theory to entangle excitons with microcavity photons. This is realized by adopting an exciton-optomechanics system and introducing a nonlinear dispersive interaction with a mechanical oscillator. We show that when either the exciton and cavity modes in the weak-coupling regime, or the two exciton-polariton modes in the strong-coupling regime, are respectively resonant with the optomechanical Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands, entanglement between excitons and cavity photons, or between two exciton polaritons, can be established. The entanglement is in the steady state and can potentially be achievable at room temperature. In both cases, genuine tripartite entanglement is shown to be present.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Chemical Strains on the Electrocaloric Response, Polarization Morphology, Tetragonality and Negative Capacitance Effect of Ferroelectric Core-Shell Nanorods and Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) approach we proposed the analytical description of the chemical strains influence on the spontaneous polarization and electrocaloric response in ferroelectric core-shell nanorods. We postulate that the nanorod core presents a defect-free single-crystalline ferroelectric material, and the elastic defects are accumulated in the ultra-thin shell, where they can induce tensile or compressive chemical strains. The finite element modeling (FEM) based on the LGD approach reveals transitions of domain structure morphology induced by the chemical strains in the BaTiO3 nanorods. Namely, tensile chemical strains induce and support the single-domain state in the central part of the nanorod, while the curled domain structures appear near the unscreened or partially screened ends of the rod. The vortex-like domains propagate toward the central part of the rod and fill it entirely, when the rod is covered by a shell with compressive chemical strains above some critical value. The critical value depends on the nanorod sizes, aspect ratio, and screening conditions at its ends. Both analytical theory and FEM predict that the tensile chemical strains in the shell increase the nanorod polarization, lattice tetragonality, and electrocaloric response well-above the values corresponding to the bulk material. The physical reason of the increase is the strong electrostriction coupling between the mismatch-type elastic strains induced in the core by the chemical strains in the shell. Comparison with the earlier XRD data confirmed an increase of tetragonality ratio in tensiled BaTiO3 nanorods compared to the bulk material.</description>
