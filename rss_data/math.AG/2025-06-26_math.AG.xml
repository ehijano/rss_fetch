      <title>Projection Cascades of models of log del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of type-I projection cascade for a biregular model (infinite series) of log del Pezzo surfaces. We study the existence of type-I projection cascades for known classes of models of log del Pezzo surfaces, such that their images under their anti-canonical embeddings in some weighted projective space, can be described as codimension 4 and codimension 3 varieties. We obtain two cascades of length three and four cascades of length two, where each projection gives rise to a well-formed and quasismooth biregular model in lower codimension.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the tangent bundle of a projective hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a nonsingular hypersurface $X \subset \mathbb{P}^n, n \geq 4,$ of degree $d \geq 2$, we show that the space $H^1(X, \End(T_X))$ of infinitesimal deformations of the tangent bundle $T_X$ has dimension ${n+d-1 \choose d} (d-1)$ and all infinitesimal deformations are unobstructed even though $H^2(X, \End(T_X))$ can be nonzero. Furthermore, we prove that the irreducible component of the moduli space of stable bundles containing the tangent bundle is a rational variety, by constructing an explicit birational model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a holomorphic version of Weinstein's symplectic category, in which objects are holomorphic symplectic manifolds, and morphisms are holomorphic lagrangian correspondences. We then extend this category to log schemes, and prove that Gromov-Witten invariants of log Calabi-Yau 3-folds are naturally encoded as holomorphic lagrangian correspondences. Gromov-Witten invariants and Donaldson-Thomas invariants are then conjecturally related by a natural unitary lagrangian correspondence.</description>

      <title>Boundedness in general type MMP and fivefold effective termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in any sequence of a general type MMP, the minimal log discrepancy of singularities takes at most finitely many values, and the fibers of all the extremal contractions and flips belong to a bounded family. As an application, we prove the effective termination of general type MMPs in dimension at most $5$. A key ingredient in the proof is an analysis of the behavior of local volumes in the MMP.</description>

      <title>Non-isomorphic subfields of the BM and GGS maximal function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016 Tafazolian et al. introduced new families of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$-maximal function fields $\mathcal{Y}_{n,s}$ and $\mathcal{X}_{n,s,a,b}$ arising as subfields of the first generalized GK function field (GGS). In this way the authors found new examples of maximal function fields that are not isomorphic to subfields of the Hermitian function field. In this paper we construct analogous function fields $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_{n,s}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{n,s,a,b}$ as subfields of the second generalized GK function field (BM) and determine their automorphism groups. Using that the automorphism group is an invariant under isomorphism, we show that the function fields $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_{n,s}$ and ${\mathcal{Y}}_{n,s}$, as well as $\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{n,s,a,b}$ and $\mathcal{X}_{n,s,a,b}$, are not isomorphic unless $m/s$ divides $q^2-q+1$ and $3$ divides $n$. In other words, the difference between the BM and GGS function fields can be found again at the level of the subfields that we consider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an isolated complete intersection singularity (ICIS), we define and study its Gauss-Manin system and its associated Hodge filtration. We show the relation between the Hodge filtration and a generalized Brieskorn lattice and study conditions for the existence of a microlocal structure. Using these ideas, we relate the residue on the saturated Brieskorn lattice with a $b$-function introduced by Torrelli.</description>

      <title>The Chern character of the Laughlin vector bundle in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin by explaining how a physical problem of studying the quantum Hall effect on a closed surface $C$ leads, via Laughlin's approach, to a mathematical question of describing the rank and the first Chern class of a particular vector bundle on the Picard group ${\rm Pic}^g(C)$. Then we formulate and solve the problem mathematically, proving several important conjectures made by physicists, in particular the Wen-Niu topological degeneracy conjecture and the Wen-Zee shift formula.
  Let $C$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus~$g$ and $S^NC$ its $N$th symmetric power. The product $C \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$ carries a universal line bundle. On the product $C^N \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$ we consider the product of $N$ pull-backs of this universal line bundle and twist it by a power of the diagonal on $C^N$. The resulting line bundle descends onto $S^NC \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$. Its push-forward (as a sheaf) to ${\rm Pic}^d(C)$ is a vector bundle that we call Laughlin's vector bundle. We determine all the Chern characters of the Laughlin vector bundle via a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch calculation.</description>

      <title>On flexibility of trinomial varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trinomial varieties are affine varieties given by a system of equations consisting of polynomials with three terms. Such varieties are total coordinate spaces of normal varieties with torus action of complexity one. For an affine variety $X$ we consider the subgroup $\mathrm{SAut}(X)$ of the automorphism group generated by all algebraic subgroups isomorphic to the additive group of the ground field. By definition, an affine variety is flexible if $\mathrm{SAut}(X)$ acts transitively on its regular locus. Gaifullin proved a sufficient condition for a trinomial hypersurface to be flexible. We give a generalization of his results, proving a sufficient condition to be flexible for an arbitrary trinomial variety.</description>

      <title>The Fano of lines, the Kuznetsov component, and a flop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuznetsov component of the derived category of a cubic fourfold is a `non-commutative K3 surface'. Its symmetric square is hence a `non-commutative hyperkaehler fourfold'. We prove that this category is equivalent to the derived category of an actual hyperkaehler fourfold: the Fano of lines in the cubic. This verifies a conjecture of Galkin.
  One of the key steps in our proof is a new derived equivalence for a specific 12-dimensional flop.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of critical points on real algebraic sets and applications to optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F \in \R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ and the zero set $V=\zero(\mathcal{P},\R^n)$, where $\mathcal{P}:=\{P_1,\ldots,P_s\} \subset \R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ is a finite set of polynomials. We investigate existence of critical points of $F$ on an infinitesimal perturbation $V_{\xi} = \zero(\{P_1-\xi_1.\ldots,P_s-\xi_s\},\R^n)$. Our motivation is to understand the limiting behavior of central paths in polynomial optimization, which is an important problem in the theory of interior point methods for polynomial optimization. We establish different sets of conditions that ensure existence, finiteness, boundedness, and non-degeneracy of critical points of $F$ on $V_{\xi}$, respectively. These lead to new conditions for the existence, convergence, and smoothness of central paths of polynomial optimization and its extension to non-linear optimization problems involving definable sets and functions in an o-minimal structure. In particular, for nonlinear programs defined by real globally analytic functions, our extension provides a stronger form of the convergence result obtained by Drummond and Peterzil.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous logic of globally valued fields -- A globally valued field is a field endowed with a family of absolute values that satisfy a product formula. Number fields and function fields in one variable give classical and fundamental examples; Nevanlinna theory also gives rise to such structures on the field of meromorphic functions on $\mathbf C$. These globally valued fields can be studied in the context of continuous logic (for which the predicates are real valued), and such a study has been undertaken some 10 years ago by Ben Yaacov and Hrushovski, thus providing a model-theoretic framework for the diophantine theory of heights. One of the first fundamental results in the tehory states the the field of algebraic numbers, with its essentially unique structure of a globally valued field, is existentially closed: every system involving polynomial equalities and inequalities, as well as strict inequalities in heights, possesses a solution in algebraic numbers as soon as it possesses some solution in a globally valued extension. The proof, due to Szachniewicz, is inspired by the proof proposed by Ben Yaacov and Hrushovski in the case of function fields: the latter used in a crucial way the description by Boucksom, Demailly, P\u aun and Peternell of the cone of mobile curves in a complex projective variety, the case of number fields relies on recent results in Arakelov geometry.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a pencil of plane curves defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with no $\mathbb{F}_q$-points in its base locus. We investigate the number of curves in $\mathcal{L}$ whose $\mathbb{F}_q$-points form a blocking set. When the degree of the pencil is allowed to grow with respect to $q$, we show that the geometric problem can be translated into a purely combinatorial problem about disjoint blocking sets. We also study the same problem when the degree of the pencil is fixed.</description>

This extends the previous work of Kumar from $G/B$ to $G/P$. When $G$ is of finite type, i.e., it is a semisimple group, then it was proved by Anderson-Griffeth-Miller.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two types of wellformed and quasismooth biregular models (infinite series) of rigid orbifold del Pezzo surfaces having their (sub) anti-canonical embeddings in $\mathbb P^6(w_i) $. One type of model contains a family of rigid del Pezzo surfaces with a fixed Fano index and weights of ambient $\mathbb P^6(w_i)$ are parameterized by positive integers. In the other type of models, weights of $\mathbb P^6(w_i)$ and Fano index, both are parameterized by the positive integers. The equations describing their images under (sub) anti-canonical embeddings are given in terms of the equations of the Segre embedding of $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$, which has codimension 4 in $\mathbb P^7$. We also give a formula for the Hilbert series of a generic weighted $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$ variety, a key tool in these constructions.</description>

      <title>Constructions and deformations of Calabi--Yau 3-folds in codimension 4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct polarized Calabi--Yau 3-folds with at worst isolated canonical orbifold points in codimension 4 that can be described in terms of the equations of the Segre embedding of $\mathbb P^2 \times \mathbb P^2$ in $\mathbb P^8$. We investigate the existence of other deformation families in their Hilbert scheme by either studying Tom and Jerry degenerations or by comparing their Hilbert series with those of existing low codimension Calabi--Yau 3-folds. Among other interesting results, we find a family of Calabi--Yau 3-fold with five distinct Tom and Jerry deformation families, a phenomenon not seen for $\mathbb Q$-Fano 3-folds. We compute the Hodge numbers of $\mathbb P^2 \times \mathbb P^2 $ Calabi--Yau 3-folds and corresponding manifolds obtained by performing crepant resolutions. We obtain a manifold with a pair of Hodge numbers that does not appear in the famously known list of 30108 distinct Hodge pairs of Kruzer--Skarke, in the list of 7890 distinct Hodge pairs corresponding to complete intersections in the product of projective spaces and in Hodge paris obtained from Calabi--Yau 3-folds having low codimension embeddings in weighted projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Abhyankar-Moh Semigroups for arbitrary hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arbitrary hypersurface singularity, we construct a family of semigroups associated with algebraically closed fields that arise as an infinite union of rings of series. These semigroups extend the value semigroup of a plane curve studied by Abhyankar and Moh. The algebraically closed fields under consideration possess a natural valuation that induces a corresponding value semigroup. We establish the necessary conditions under which these semigroups are independent of the choice of the root. Moreover, the extensions proposed by P. Gonz\'alez and Kiyek-Micus, where Gonz\'alez specifically addresses the case of quasi-ordinary singularities, and the extension introduced by Abbas-Assi, can be understood as particular instances within our constructed family.</description>

      <title>Pairing Anderson motives via formal residues in the Frobenius endomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson modules form a generalization of Drinfeld modules and are commonly understood as the counterpart of abelian varieties but with function field coefficients. In an attempt to study their ``motivic theory'', two objects of semilinear algebra are attached to an Anderson module: its motive and its dual motive. While the former is better suited to follow the analogy with Grothendieck motives, the latter has proven much useful in the study of transcendence questions in positive characteristic. Despite sharing similar definitions, the relationship between motives and dual motives has remained nebulous. Over perfect fields, it was only proved recently by the second author that the finite generation of the motive is equivalent to the finite generation of the dual motive, answering a long-standing open question in function field arithmetic (the ``abelian equals $A$-finite'' theorem). This work constructs a perfect pairing among the motive and the dual motive of an Anderson module, with values in a module of differentials, thus answering a question raised by Hartl and Juschka. Our construction involves taking the residue of certain formal power series in the Frobenius endomorphism. Although it may seem peculiar, this pairing is natural and compatible with base change. It also comes with several new consequences in function field arithmetic; for example, we generalize the ``abelian equals A-finite'' theorem to a large class of algebras, including fields, perfect algebras and noetherian regular domains.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds via Exceptional Group Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete proof of the (1,1)-type Hodge conjecture for a special class of 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds ($h^{1,1}=56$), while establishing and implementing a novel methodology based on exceptional group constraints. The core idea of this methodology is to replace the "geometric construction" that traditional methods rely on -- which becomes infeasible in high-dimensional cases -- with the "algebraic rigidity" of Lie algebra representation theory. We prove that by introducing the symmetry of the $E_7$ group, we can generate a "dimension tension" in the Spencer cohomology framework we developed, which forcibly makes the dimension of the Spencer kernel precisely match the Hodge numbers of the manifold, thereby bypassing concrete algebraic geometric calculations. This dimension matching result is a key step in satisfying the "Spencer-Hodge verification criterion" we previously established. Its completion not only solves a non-trivial special case of the Hodge conjecture, but more importantly, provides the first strong evidence for this new paradigm of connecting representation theory with Hodge theory to solve core problems in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Perfectly generated $t$-structures for algebraic stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies $t$-structures for the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact quasi-separated algebraic stack. Specifically, using Thomason filtrations, we classify those $t$-structures which are generated by perfect complexes and satisfy a tensor compatibility. Interestingly, the only input required is the classification \`{a} la Hrbek for the affine scheme case.</description>

      <title>The CompGIT package: a computational tool for Geometric Invariant Theory quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe CompGIT, a SageMath package to describe Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) quotients of projective space by simple groups. The implementation is based on algorithms described by Gallardo--Martinez-Garcia--Moon--Swinarski. In principle the package is sufficient to describe any GIT quotient of a projective variety by a simple group -- in practice it requires that the user can construct an equivariant embedding of the polarised variety into projective space. The package describes the non-stable and unstable loci up to conjugation by the group, as well as describing the strictly polystable loci. We discuss potential applications of the outputs of CompGIT to algebraic geometry problems, a well as suggesting directions for future developments.</description>

      <title>Derived analytic geometry: Derived K\"ahler space and Hodge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce higher analytic geometry, a novel framework extending Lurie's derived complex analytic spaces. This theory generalizes classical complex analytic geometry, enabling the study of derived K\"ahler spaces with non-trivial higher homotopy groups. We develop derived de Rham and Dolbeault cohomologies, yielding a Hodge decomposition for compact derived K\"ahler spaces, and establish a derived Stokes' theorem, unifying classical results with homotopical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the number of singularities - counted whit multiplicities - of generic distributions of dimension and codimension one on smooth complete intersections in compact toric orbifolds with isolated singularities. We also present some applications of this results. First, we analyze the case of regular distributions. As a second application, we establish a Poincar\'e-type inequality that relates the multidegree of a foliation to the multidegrees of an invariant smooth complete intersection curve.</description>

      <title>Space spanned by characteristic exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several rigidity results on multiplier spectrum and length spectrum. For example, we show that for every non-exceptional rational map $f:\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})\to\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ of degree $d\geq2$, the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space generated by all the (finite) characteristic exponents of periodic points of $f$ has infinite dimension. This answers a stronger version of a question of Levy and Tucker. Our result can also be seen as a generalization of recent results of Ji-Xie and of Huguin which proved Milnor's conjecture about rational maps having integer multipliers. We also get a characterization of postcritically finite maps by using its length spectrum. Finally as an application of our result, we get a new proof of the Zariski-dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms on $(\mathbb{P}^1)^N, N\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Continuity of HYM connections with respect to metric variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the set of (real Dolbeault classes of) balanced metrics $\Theta$ on a balanced manifold $X$ with respect to which a torsion-free coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ is slope stable. We prove that the set of all such $[\Theta] \in H^{n - 1,n - 1}(X,\mathbb{R})$ is an open convex cone locally defined by a finite number of linear inequalities.
  When $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle, the Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence provides associated Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, which we show depend continuously on the metric, even around classes with respect to which $\mathcal{E}$ is only semi-stable. In this case, the holomorphic structure induced by the connection is the holomorphic structure of the associated graded object. The method relies on semi-stable perturbation techniques for geometric PDEs with a moment map interpretation and is quite versatile, and we hope that it can be used in other similar problems.</description>

      <title>Nil modules and the envelope of a submodule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring and $N$ be a submodule of an $R$-module $M$. The submodule $\langle E_M(N)\rangle$ generated by the envelope $E_M(N)$ of $N$ is instrumental in studying rings and modules that satisfy the radical formula. We show that: 1) the semiprime radical is an invariant on all the submodules which are respectively generated by envelopes in the ascending chain of envelopes of a given submodule; 2) for rings that satisfy the radical formula, $\langle E_M(0)\rangle$ is an idempotent radical and it induces a torsion theory whose torsion class consists of all nil $R$-modules and the torsionfree class consists of all reduced $R$-modules; and 3) Noetherian uniserial modules satisfy the semiprime radical formula and their semiprime radical is a nil module.</description>
