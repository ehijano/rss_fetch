      <title>Explaining the (Not So) Obvious: Simple and Fast Explanation of STAN, a Next Point of Interest Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lot of effort in recent years have been expended to explain machine learning systems. However, some machine learning methods are inherently explainable, and thus are not completely black box. This enables the developers to make sense of the output without a developing a complex and expensive explainability technique. Besides that, explainability should be tailored to suit the context of the problem. In a recommendation system which relies on collaborative filtering, the recommendation is based on the behaviors of similar users, therefore the explanation should tell which other users are similar to the current user. Similarly, if the recommendation system is based on sequence prediction, the explanation should also tell which input timesteps are the most influential. We demonstrate this philosophy/paradigm in STAN (Spatio-Temporal Attention Network for Next Location Recommendation), a next Point of Interest recommendation system based on collaborative filtering and sequence prediction. We also show that the explanation helps to "debug" the output.</description>

      <title>LLMTemporalComparator: A Tool for Analysing Differences in Temporal Adaptations of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of analyzing temporal discrepancies in large language models (LLMs) trained on data from different time periods. To facilitate the automatic exploration of these differences, we propose a novel system that compares in a systematic way the outputs of two LLM versions based on user-defined queries. The system first generates a hierarchical topic structure rooted in a user-specified keyword, allowing for an organized comparison of topical categories. Subsequently, it evaluates the generated text by both LLMs to identify differences in vocabulary, information presentation, and underlying themes. This fully automated approach not only streamlines the identification of shifts in public opinion and cultural norms but also enhances our understanding of the adaptability and robustness of machine learning applications in response to temporal changes. By fostering research in continual model adaptation and comparative summarization, this work contributes to the development of more transparent machine learning models capable of capturing the nuances of evolving societal contexts.</description>

      <title>Metadata-based Data Exploration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing the capacity to effectively search for requisite datasets is an urgent requirement to assist data users in identifying relevant datasets considering the very limited available metadata. For this challenge, the utilization of third-party data is emerging as a valuable source for improvement. Our research introduces a new architecture for data exploration which employs a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance metadata-based data discovery. The system integrates large language models (LLMs) with external vector databases to identify semantic relationships among diverse types of datasets. The proposed framework offers a new method for evaluating semantic similarity among heterogeneous data sources and for improving data exploration. Our study includes experimental results on four critical tasks: 1) recommending similar datasets, 2) suggesting combinable datasets, 3) estimating tags, and 4) predicting variables. Our results demonstrate that RAG can enhance the selection of relevant datasets, particularly from different categories, when compared to conventional metadata approaches. However, performance varied across tasks and models, which confirms the significance of selecting appropriate techniques based on specific use cases. The findings suggest that this approach holds promise for addressing challenges in data exploration and discovery, although further refinement is necessary for estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Social Choice for Heterogeneous Fairness in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness in recommender systems requires close attention to the needs of a diverse set of stakeholders that may have competing interests. Previous work in this area has often been limited by fixed, single-objective definitions of fairness, built into algorithms or optimization criteria that are applied to a single fairness dimension or, at most, applied identically across dimensions. These narrow conceptualizations limit the ability to adapt fairness-aware solutions to the wide range of stakeholder needs and fairness definitions that arise in practice. Our work approaches recommendation fairness from the standpoint of computational social choice, using a multi-agent framework. In this paper, we explore the properties of different social choice mechanisms and demonstrate the successful integration of multiple, heterogeneous fairness definitions across multiple data sets.</description>

      <title>Ranking Policy Learning via Marketplace Expected Value Estimation From Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a decision making framework to cast the problem of learning a ranking policy for search or recommendation engines in a two-sided e-commerce marketplace as an expected reward optimization problem using observational data. As a value allocation mechanism, the ranking policy allocates retrieved items to the designated slots so as to maximize the user utility from the slotted items, at any given stage of the shopping journey. The objective of this allocation can in turn be defined with respect to the underlying probabilistic user browsing model as the expected number of interaction events on presented items matching the user intent, given the ranking context. Through recognizing the effect of ranking as an intervention action to inform users' interactions with slotted items and the corresponding economic value of the interaction events for the marketplace, we formulate the expected reward of the marketplace as the collective value from all presented ranking actions. The key element in this formulation is a notion of context value distribution, which signifies not only the attribution of value to ranking interventions within a session but also the distribution of marketplace reward across user sessions. We build empirical estimates for the expected reward of the marketplace from observational data that account for the heterogeneity of economic value across session contexts as well as the distribution shifts in learning from observational user activity data. The ranking policy can then be trained by optimizing the empirical expected reward estimates via standard Bayesian inference techniques. We report empirical results for a product search ranking task in a major e-commerce platform demonstrating the fundamental trade-offs governed by ranking polices trained on empirical reward estimates with respect to extreme choices of the context value distribution.</description>

      <title>Decoding MIE: A Novel Dataset Approach Using Topic Extraction and Affiliation Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of medical informatics literature presents significant challenges in synthesizing and analyzing research trends. This study introduces a novel dataset derived from the Medical Informatics Europe (MIE) Conference proceedings, addressing the need for sophisticated analytical tools in the field. Utilizing the Triple-A software, we extracted and processed metadata and abstract from 4,606 articles published in the "Studies in Health Technology and Informatics" journal series, focusing on MIE conferences from 1996 onwards. Our methodology incorporated advanced techniques such as affiliation parsing using the TextRank algorithm. The resulting dataset, available in JSON format, offers a comprehensive view of bibliometric details, extracted topics, and standardized affiliation information. Analysis of this data revealed interesting patterns in Digital Object Identifier usage, citation trends, and authorship attribution across the years. Notably, we observed inconsistencies in author data and a brief period of linguistic diversity in publications. This dataset represents a significant contribution to the medical informatics community, enabling longitudinal studies of research trends, collaboration network analyses, and in-depth bibliometric investigations. By providing this enriched, structured resource spanning nearly three decades of conference proceedings, we aim to facilitate novel insights and advancements in the rapidly evolving field of medical informatics.</description>

      <title>Item Cluster-aware Prompt Learning for Session-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to capture dynamic user preferences by analyzing item sequences within individual sessions. However, most existing approaches focus mainly on intra-session item relationships, neglecting the connections between items across different sessions (inter-session relationships), which limits their ability to fully capture complex item interactions. While some methods incorporate inter-session information, they often suffer from high computational costs, leading to longer training times and reduced efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose the CLIP-SBR (Cluster-aware Item Prompt learning for Session-Based Recommendation) framework. CLIP-SBR is composed of two modules: 1) an item relationship mining module that builds a global graph to effectively model both intra- and inter-session relationships, and 2) an item cluster-aware prompt learning module that uses soft prompts to integrate these relationships into SBR models efficiently. We evaluate CLIP-SBR across eight SBR models and three benchmark datasets, consistently demonstrating improved recommendation performance and establishing CLIP-SBR as a robust solution for session-based recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>Correcting for Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems via Item Loss Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) often suffer from popularity bias, where a small set of popular items dominate the recommendation results due to their high interaction rates, leaving many less popular items overlooked. This phenomenon disproportionately benefits users with mainstream tastes while neglecting those with niche interests, leading to unfairness among users and exacerbating disparities in recommendation quality across different user groups. In this paper, we propose an in-processing approach to address this issue by intervening in the training process of recommendation models. Drawing inspiration from fair empirical risk minimization in machine learning, we augment the objective function of the recommendation model with an additional term aimed at minimizing the disparity in loss values across different item groups during the training process. Our approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and compared against state-of-the-art baselines. The results demonstrate the superior efficacy of our method in mitigating the unfairness of popularity bias while incurring only negligible loss in recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>FELLAS: Enhancing Federated Sequential Recommendation with LLM as External Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated sequential recommendation (FedSeqRec) has gained growing attention due to its ability to protect user privacy. Unfortunately, the performance of FedSeqRec is still unsatisfactory because the models used in FedSeqRec have to be lightweight to accommodate communication bandwidth and clients' on-device computational resource constraints. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong transferable and generalized language understanding abilities and therefore, in the NLP area, many downstream tasks now utilize LLMs as a service to achieve superior performance without constructing complex models. Inspired by this successful practice, we propose a generic FedSeqRec framework, FELLAS, which aims to enhance FedSeqRec by utilizing LLMs as an external service. Specifically, FELLAS employs an LLM server to provide both item-level and sequence-level representation assistance. The item-level representation service is queried by the central server to enrich the original ID-based item embedding with textual information, while the sequence-level representation service is accessed by each client. However, invoking the sequence-level representation service requires clients to send sequences to the external LLM server. To safeguard privacy, we implement dx-privacy satisfied sequence perturbation, which protects clients' sensitive data with guarantees. Additionally, a contrastive learning-based method is designed to transfer knowledge from the noisy sequence representation to clients' sequential recommendation models. Furthermore, to empirically validate the privacy protection capability of FELLAS, we propose two interacted item inference attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets with two widely used sequential recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and privacy-preserving capability of FELLAS.</description>

      <title>Leverage Knowledge Graph and Large Language Model for Law Article Recommendation: A Case Study of Chinese Criminal Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Court efficiency is vital for social stability. However, in most countries around the world, the grassroots courts face case backlogs, with decisions relying heavily on judicial personnel's cognitive labor, lacking intelligent tools to improve efficiency. To address this issue, we propose an efficient law article recommendation approach utilizing a Knowledge Graph (KG) and a Large Language Model (LLM). Firstly, we propose a Case-Enhanced Law Article Knowledge Graph (CLAKG) as a database to store current law statutes, historical case information, and correspondence between law articles and historical cases. Additionally, we introduce an automated CLAKG construction method based on LLM. On this basis, we propose a closed-loop law article recommendation method. Finally, through a series of experiments using judgment documents from the website "China Judgements Online", we have improved the accuracy of law article recommendation in cases from 0.549 to 0.694, demonstrating that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>On the Biased Assessment of Expert Finding Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large organisations, identifying experts on a given topic is crucial in leveraging the internal knowledge spread across teams and departments. So-called enterprise expert retrieval systems automatically discover and structure employees' expertise based on the vast amount of heterogeneous data available about them and the work they perform. Evaluating these systems requires comprehensive ground truth expert annotations, which are hard to obtain. Therefore, the annotation process typically relies on automated recommendations of knowledge areas to validate. This case study provides an analysis of how these recommendations can impact the evaluation of expert finding systems. We demonstrate on a popular benchmark that system-validated annotations lead to overestimated performance of traditional term-based retrieval models and even invalidate comparisons with more recent neural methods. We also augment knowledge areas with synonyms to uncover a strong bias towards literal mentions of their constituent words. Finally, we propose constraints to the annotation process to prevent these biased evaluations, and show that this still allows annotation suggestions of high utility. These findings should inform benchmark creation or selection for expert finding, to guarantee meaningful comparison of methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference for Large Language Model-based Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding. For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls. Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification. Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed sampling verification. The codes and datasets will be released in the near future.</description>

      <title>Combining Open-box Simulation and Importance Sampling for Tuning Large-Scale Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing scale of recommender systems require extensive tuning to respond to market dynamics and system changes. We address the challenge of tuning a large-scale ads recommendation platform with multiple continuous parameters influencing key performance indicators (KPIs). Traditional methods like open-box Monte Carlo simulators, while accurate, are computationally expensive due to the high cost of evaluating numerous parameter settings. To mitigate this, we propose a hybrid approach Simulator-Guided Importance Sampling (SGIS) that combines open-box simulation with importance sampling (IS). SGIS leverages the strengths of both techniques: it performs a coarse enumeration over the parameter space to identify promising initial settings and then uses IS to iteratively refine these settings. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in KPI estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SGIS through simulations as well as real-world experiments, showing that it achieves substantial improvements in KPIs with lower computational overhead compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>C3PA: An Open Dataset of Expert-Annotated and Regulation-Aware Privacy Policies to Enable Scalable Regulatory Compliance Audits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of tools and techniques to analyze and extract organizations data habits from privacy policies are critical for scalable regulatory compliance audits. Unfortunately, these tools are becoming increasingly limited in their ability to identify compliance issues and fixes. After all, most were developed using regulation-agnostic datasets of annotated privacy policies obtained from a time before the introduction of landmark privacy regulations such as EUs GDPR and Californias CCPA. In this paper, we describe the first open regulation-aware dataset of expert-annotated privacy policies, C3PA (CCPA Privacy Policy Provision Annotations), aimed to address this challenge. C3PA contains over 48K expert-labeled privacy policy text segments associated with responses to CCPA-specific disclosure mandates from 411 unique organizations. We demonstrate that the C3PA dataset is uniquely suited for aiding automated audits of compliance with CCPA-related disclosure mandates.</description>

Abstract: Links are a fundamental part of information networks, turning isolated pieces of knowledge into a network of information that is much richer than the sum of its parts. However, adding a new link to the network is not trivial: it requires not only the identification of a suitable pair of source and target entities but also the understanding of the content of the source to locate a suitable position for the link in the text. The latter problem has not been addressed effectively, particularly in the absence of text spans in the source that could serve as anchors to insert a link to the target entity. To bridge this gap, we introduce and operationalize the task of entity insertion in information networks. Focusing on the case of Wikipedia, we empirically show that this problem is, both, relevant and challenging for editors. We compile a benchmark dataset in 105 languages and develop a framework for entity insertion called LocEI (Localized Entity Insertion) and its multilingual variant XLocEI. We show that XLocEI outperforms all baseline models (including state-of-the-art prompt-based ranking with LLMs such as GPT-4) and that it can be applied in a zero-shot manner on languages not seen during training with minimal performance drop. These findings are important for applying entity insertion models in practice, e.g., to support editors in adding links across the more than 300 language versions of Wikipedia.</description>

      <title>Modeling Social Media Recommendation Impacts Using Academic Networks: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media has highlighted potential negative impacts on society and individuals, largely driven by recommendation algorithms that shape user behavior and social dynamics. Understanding these algorithms is essential but challenging due to the complex, distributed nature of social media networks as well as limited access to real-world data. This study proposes to use academic social networks as a proxy for investigating recommendation systems in social media. By employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we develop a model that separates the prediction of academic infosphere from behavior prediction, allowing us to simulate recommender-generated infospheres and assess the model's performance in predicting future co-authorships. Our approach aims to improve our understanding of recommendation systems' roles and social networks modeling. To support the reproducibility of our work we publicly make available our implementations: https://github.com/DimNeuroLab/academic_network_project</description>

      <title>TableRAG: Million-Token Table Understanding with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have notably enhanced their ability to reason with tabular data, primarily through program-aided mechanisms that manipulate and analyze tables. However, these methods often require the entire table as input, leading to scalability challenges due to the positional bias or context length constraints. In response to these challenges, we introduce TableRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for LM-based table understanding. TableRAG leverages query expansion combined with schema and cell retrieval to pinpoint crucial information before providing it to the LMs. This enables more efficient data encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and mitigating information loss. We have developed two new million-token benchmarks from the Arcade and BIRD-SQL datasets to thoroughly evaluate TableRAG's effectiveness at scale. Our results demonstrate that TableRAG's retrieval design achieves the highest retrieval quality, leading to the new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale table understanding.</description>

      <title>Causal Micro-Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to classify causal micro-narratives from text. These narratives are sentence-level explanations of the cause(s) and/or effect(s) of a target subject. The approach requires only a subject-specific ontology of causes and effects, and we demonstrate it with an application to inflation narratives. Using a human-annotated dataset spanning historical and contemporary US news articles for training, we evaluate several large language models (LLMs) on this multi-label classification task. The best-performing model--a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B--achieves F1 scores of 0.87 on narrative detection and 0.71 on narrative classification. Comprehensive error analysis reveals challenges arising from linguistic ambiguity and highlights how model errors often mirror human annotator disagreements. This research establishes a framework for extracting causal micro-narratives from real-world data, with wide-ranging applications to social science research.</description>

Abstract: Query-based text summarization is an important real world problem that requires to condense the prolix text data into a summary under the guidance of the query information provided by users. The topic has been studied for a long time and there are many existing interesting research related to query-based text summarization. Yet much of the work is not systematically surveyed. This survey aims at summarizing some interesting work in query-based text summarization methods as well as related generic text summarization methods. Not all taxonomies in this paper exist the related work to the best of our knowledge and some analysis will be presented.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Practicality of Generative Retrieval on Dynamic Corpora</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18952v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmarking the performance of information retrieval (IR) is mostly conducted with a fixed set of documents (static corpora). However, in realistic scenarios, this is rarely the case and the documents to be retrieved are constantly updated and added. In this paper, we focus on Generative Retrievals (GR), which apply autoregressive language models to IR problems, and explore their adaptability and robustness in dynamic scenarios. We also conduct an extensive evaluation of computational and memory efficiency, crucial factors for real-world deployment of IR systems handling vast and ever-changing document collections. Our results on the StreamingQA benchmark demonstrate that GR is more adaptable to evolving knowledge (4-11%), robust in learning knowledge with temporal information, and efficient in terms of inference FLOPs (x2), indexing time (x6), and storage footprint (x4) compared to Dual Encoders (DE), which are commonly used in retrieval systems. Our paper highlights the potential of GR for future use in practical IR systems within dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>A Pre-trained Sequential Recommendation Framework: Popularity Dynamics for Zero-shot Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommenders are crucial to the success of online applications, \eg e-commerce, video streaming, and social media. While model architectures continue to improve, for every new application domain, we still have to train a new model from scratch for high quality recommendations. On the other hand, pre-trained language and vision models have shown great success in zero-shot or few-shot adaptation to new application domains. Inspired by the success of pre-trained models in peer AI fields, we propose a novel pre-trained sequential recommendation framework: PrepRec. We learn universal item representations by modeling item popularity dynamics. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information, can not only zero-shot transfer to a new domain, but achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models with only a fraction of the model size. In addition, with a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec can improve the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 13.8\% in Recall@10 and 29.5% in NDCG@10. We provide an anonymized implementation of PrepRec at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PrepRec--2F60/</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Training ID-Agnostic Multi-modal Sequential Recommenders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17372v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) aims to predict future user-item interactions based on historical interactions. While many SR approaches concentrate on user IDs and item IDs, the human perception of the world through multi-modal signals, like text and images, has inspired researchers to delve into constructing SR from multi-modal information without using IDs. However, the complexity of multi-modal learning manifests in diverse feature extractors, fusion methods, and pre-trained models. Consequently, designing a simple and universal \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{S}equential \textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{MMSR}) framework remains a formidable challenge. We systematically summarize the existing multi-modal related SR methods and distill the essence into four core components: visual encoder, text encoder, multimodal fusion module, and sequential architecture. Along these dimensions, we dissect the model designs, and answer the following sub-questions: First, we explore how to construct MMSR from scratch, ensuring its performance either on par with or exceeds existing SR methods without complex techniques. Second, we examine if MMSR can benefit from existing multi-modal pre-training paradigms. Third, we assess MMSR's capability in tackling common challenges like cold start and domain transferring. Our experiment results across four real-world recommendation scenarios demonstrate the great potential ID-agnostic multi-modal sequential recommendation. Our framework can be found at: https://github.com/MMSR23/MMSR.</description>

      <title>ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Documents are visually rich structures that convey information through text, as well as tables, figures, page layouts, or fonts. While modern document retrieval systems exhibit strong performance on query-to-text matching, they struggle to exploit visual cues efficiently, hindering their performance on practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation. To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieving tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and settings. The inherent shortcomings of modern systems motivate the introduction of a new retrieval model architecture, ColPali, which leverages the document understanding capabilities of recent Vision Language Models to produce high-quality contextualized embeddings solely from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically faster and end-to-end trainable.</description>

      <title>Mindful-RAG: A Study of Points of Failure in Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are proficient at generating coherent and contextually relevant text but face challenges when addressing knowledge-intensive queries in domain-specific and factual question-answering tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems mitigate this by incorporating external knowledge sources, such as structured knowledge graphs (KGs). However, LLMs often struggle to produce accurate answers despite access to KG-extracted information containing necessary facts. Our study investigates this dilemma by analyzing error patterns in existing KG-based RAG methods and identifying eight critical failure points. We observed that these errors predominantly occur due to insufficient focus on discerning the question's intent and adequately gathering relevant context from the knowledge graph facts. Drawing on this analysis, we propose the Mindful-RAG approach, a framework designed for intent-based and contextually aligned knowledge retrieval. This method explicitly targets the identified failures and offers improvements in the correctness and relevance of responses provided by LLMs, representing a significant step forward from existing methods.</description>

      <title>Customizing Language Models with Instance-wise LoRA for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems predict a user's next item of interest by analyzing past interactions, aligning recommendations with individual preferences. Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches have applied LLMs to sequential recommendation through language generation paradigms. These methods convert user behavior sequences into prompts for LLM fine-tuning, utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to refine recommendations. However, the uniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors sometimes fails to capture individual variability, leading to suboptimal performance and negative transfer between disparate sequences. To address these challenges, we propose Instance-wise LoRA (iLoRA), integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. iLoRA creates a diverse array of experts, each capturing specific aspects of user preferences, and introduces a sequence representation guided gate function. This gate function processes historical interaction sequences to generate enriched representations, guiding the gating network to output customized expert participation weights. This tailored approach mitigates negative transfer and dynamically adjusts to diverse behavior patterns. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods in capturing user-specific preferences and improving recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Prompting for Pairwise Ranking: An Effective Non-Parametric Retrieval Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A supervised ranking model, despite its advantage of being effective, usually involves complex processing - typically multiple stages of task-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. This has motivated researchers to explore simpler pipelines leveraging large language models (LLMs) that are capable of working in a zero-shot manner. However, since zero-shot inference does not make use of a training set of pairs of queries and their relevant documents, its performance is mostly worse than that of supervised models, which are trained on such example pairs. Motivated by the existing findings that training examples generally improve zero-shot performance, in our work, we explore if this also applies to ranking models. More specifically, given a query and a pair of documents, the preference prediction task is improved by augmenting examples of preferences for similar queries from a training set. Our proposed pairwise few-shot ranker demonstrates consistent improvements over the zero-shot baseline on both in-domain (TREC DL) and out-domain (BEIR subset) retrieval benchmarks. Our method also achieves a close performance to that of a supervised model without requiring any complex training pipeline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models are applied to recommendation tasks such as items to buy and news articles to read. Point of Interest is quite a new area to sequential recommendation based on language representations of multimodal datasets. As a first step to prove our concepts, we focused on restaurant recommendation based on each user's past visit history. When choosing a next restaurant to visit, a user would consider genre and location of the venue and, if available, pictures of dishes served there. We created a pseudo restaurant check-in history dataset from the Foursquare dataset and the FoodX-251 dataset by converting pictures into text descriptions with a multimodal model called LLaVA, and used a language-based sequential recommendation framework named Recformer proposed in 2023. A model trained on this semi-multimodal dataset has outperformed another model trained on the same dataset without picture descriptions. This suggests that this semi-multimodal model reflects actual human behaviours and that our path to a multimodal recommendation model is in the right direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies has led to the widespread availability and effectiveness of text generation tools such as ChatGPT and Claude. While highly useful, these technologies also pose significant risks to the credibility of various media forms if they are employed for paraphrased plagiarism -- one of the most subtle forms of content misuse in scientific literature and general text media. Although automated methods for paraphrase identification have been developed, detecting this type of plagiarism remains challenging due to the inconsistent nature of the datasets used to train these methods. In this article, we examine traditional and contemporary approaches to paraphrase identification, investigating how the under-representation of certain paraphrase types in popular datasets, including those used to train Large Language Models (LLMs), affects the ability to detect plagiarism. We introduce and validate a new refined typology for paraphrases (ReParaphrased, REfined PARAPHRASE typology definitions) to better understand the disparities in paraphrase type representation. Lastly, we propose new directions for future research and dataset development to enhance AI-based paraphrase detection.</description>

      <title>Editing Conceptual Knowledge for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in knowledge editing for Large Language Models (LLMs). Current approaches and evaluations merely explore the instance-level editing, while whether LLMs possess the capability to modify concepts remains unclear. This paper pioneers the investigation of editing conceptual knowledge for LLMs, by constructing a novel benchmark dataset ConceptEdit and establishing a suite of new metrics for evaluation. The experimental results reveal that, although existing editing methods can efficiently modify concept-level definition to some extent, they also have the potential to distort the related instantial knowledge in LLMs, leading to poor performance. We anticipate this can inspire further progress in better understanding LLMs. Our project homepage is available at https://zjunlp.github.io/project/ConceptEdit.</description>

      <title>WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

      <title>Error Bounds of Supervised Classification from Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore bounds on the expected risk when using deep neural networks for supervised classification from an information theoretic perspective. Firstly, we introduce model risk and fitting error, which are derived from further decomposing the empirical risk. Model risk represents the expected value of the loss under the model's predicted probabilities and is exclusively dependent on the model. Fitting error measures the disparity between the empirical risk and model risk. Then, we derive the upper bound on fitting error, which links the back-propagated gradient and the model's parameter count with the fitting error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalization errors are bounded by the classification uncertainty, which is characterized by both the smoothness of the distribution and the sample size. Based on the bounds on fitting error and generalization, by utilizing the triangle inequality, we establish an upper bound on the expected risk. This bound is applied to provide theoretical explanations for overparameterization, non-convex optimization and flat minima in deep learning. Finally, empirical verification confirms a significant positive correlation between the derived theoretical bounds and the practical expected risk, thereby affirming the practical relevance of the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>DALL-M: Context-Aware Clinical Data Augmentation with LLMs</title>

Abstract: X-ray images are vital in medical diagnostics, but their effectiveness is limited without clinical context. Radiologists often find chest X-rays insufficient for diagnosing underlying diseases, necessitating comprehensive clinical features and data integration. We present a novel framework to enhance the clinical context through augmentation techniques with clinical tabular data, thereby improving its applicability and reliability in AI medical diagnostics. We introduce a pioneering approach to clinical data augmentation that employs large language models to generate patient contextual synthetic data. This methodology is crucial for training more robust deep learning models in healthcare. It preserves the integrity of real patient data while enriching the dataset with contextually relevant synthetic features, significantly enhancing model performance. Our methodology, termed DALL-M, uses a three-phase feature generation process: (i)clinical context storage, (ii)expert query generation, and (iii)context-aware feature augmentation. DALL-M generates new, clinically relevant features by synthesizing chest X-ray images and reports. Applied to 799 cases using nine features from the MIMIC-IV dataset, it created an augmented set of 91 features. This is the first work to generate contextual values for patients' X-ray reports. Specifically, we provide (i)the capacity of LLMs to generate contextual synthetic values for existing clinical features and (ii)their ability to create entirely new clinically relevant features. Empirical validation with machine learning models showed significant performance improvements. Incorporating augmented features increased the F1 score by 16.5% and Precision and Recall by approximately 25%. DALL-M addresses a critical gap in clinical data augmentation, offering a robust framework for generating contextually enriched datasets.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Estimation of Temporal Motifs using Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08975</link>

Abstract: Counting the number of small subgraphs, called motifs, is a fundamental problem in social network analysis and graph mining. Many real-world networks are directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in directed, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a plethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much richer information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif counting.
  A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal motif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs and the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a combinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four vertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms.
  We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel technique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with carefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient approximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased estimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the estimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges, TEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes more than a day. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy of TEACUPS on large datasets, showing an average of 30$\times$ speedup (up to 2000$\times$ speedup) compared to existing GPU-based exact counting methods while preserving high count estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Neural Collaborative Filtering to Detect Anomalies in Human Semantic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</description>
