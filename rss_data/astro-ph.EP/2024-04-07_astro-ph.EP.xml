      <title>Four-of-a-kind? Comprehensive atmospheric characterisation of the HR 8799 planets with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With four companions at separations from 16 to 71 au, HR 8799 is a unique target for direct imaging, presenting an opportunity for the comparative study of exoplanets with a shared formation history. Combining new VLTI/GRAVITY observations obtained within the ExoGRAVITY program with archival data, we perform a systematic atmospheric characterisation of all four planets. We explore different levels of model flexibility to understand the temperature structure, chemistry and clouds of each planet using both petitRADTRANS atmospheric retrievals and fits to self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models. Using Bayesian Model Averaging to combine multiple retrievals, we find that the HR 8799 planets are highly enriched in metals, with [M/H] $\gtrsim$1, and have stellar to super-stellar C/O ratios. The C/O ratio increases with increasing separation from $0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ for d to $0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ for b, with the exception of the innermost planet which has a C/O ratio of $0.87\pm0.03$. By retrieving a quench pressure and using a disequilibrium chemistry model we derive vertical mixing strengths compatible with predictions for high-metallicity, self-luminous atmospheres. Bayesian evidence comparisons strongly favour the presence of HCN in HR 8799 c and e, as well as CH$_{4}$ in HR 8799 c, with detections at $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence. All of the planets are cloudy, with no evidence for patchiness. The clouds of c, d and e are best fit by silicate clouds lying above a deep iron cloud layer, while the clouds of the cooler HR 8799 b are more likely composed of Na$_{2}$S. With well defined atmospheric properties, future exploration of this system is well positioned to unveil further detail in these planets, extending our understanding of the composition, structure, and formation history of these siblings.</description>

      <title>Accretion and Uneven Depletion of the Main Asteroid Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main asteroid belt (MAB) is known to be primarily composed of objects from two distinct taxonomic classes, generically defined here as S- and C-complex. The former probably originated from the inner solar system (interior to Jupiter's orbit), while the latter probably from the outer solar system. Following this definition, (4) Vesta, a V-type residing in the inner MAB (a &lt; 2.5 au), is the sole D &gt; 500 km object akin to S-complex that potentially formed in-situ. This provides a useful constraint on the number of D &gt; 500 km bodies that could have formed, or grown, within the primordial MAB. In this work we numerically simulate the accretion of objects in the MAB region during the time when gas in the protoplanetary disk still existed, while assuming different MAB primordial masses. We then accounted for the depletion of that population happening after gas disk dispersal. In our analysis, we subdivided the MAB into five sub-regions and showed that the depletion factor varies throughout the MAB. This results in uneven radial- and size-dependent depletion of the MAB. We show that the MAB primordial mass has to be $\lesssim$ 2.14$\times$10$^{-3}$ Earth masses. Larger primordial masses would lead to the accretion of tens-to-thousands of S-complex objects with D &gt; 500 km in the MAB. Such large objects would survive depletion even in the outer sub-regions (a &gt; 2.5 au), thus being inconsistent with observations. Our results also indicate that S-complex objects with D &gt; 200-300 km, including (4) Vesta, are likely to be terrestrial planetesimals implanted into the MAB rather than formed in-situ.</description>

      <title>Frequencies of warm debris disks based on point source catalogs of Spitzer, WISE, and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than a thousand warm debris disks have been detected as infrared excess at mid-infrared wavelengths, and their frequencies have been obtained for various spectral types of stars. However, the dependence of the frequencies on spectral type is still debated because the number of stars with significant and detectable infrared excess is limited. Herein, we present the largest systematic search for infrared excess using data from Gaia, WISE, and Spitzer. We identified 373, 485, and 255-reliable infrared excesses in the mid-infrared archival data at wavelengths of 12, 22, and 24 $\mu$m for WISE/$W3$, $W4$, and Spitzer/MIPS ch1, respectively. Although we confirmed that more massive stars tend to show higher frequencies of debris disks, these disk frequencies are relatively flat for both low- and intermediate-mass stars, with a jump at 7000 K for all three wavelengths. Assuming that bright, warm debris disks have lifetimes of a few to several hundred million years, the disk frequency can be understood as the ratio between the timescale and the upper limits of the sample ages. We also found that intermediate-mass stars with infrared excess tend to be bluer and fainter along the evolutionary track than those without, implying that massive stars hosting debris disks are relatively young, with an isochronal age of approximately 500 Myr. These tendencies are reasonably explained by a standard scenario in which debris disks are likely to be produced by collisions of planetesimals in early stages of stellar evolution, such as the Late Heavy Bombardment.</description>

      <title>Habitability constraints by nutrient availability in atmospheres of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life as we know it requires the presence of liquid water and the availability of nutrients, which are mainly based on the elements C, H, N, O, P, and S (CHNOPS) and trace metal micronutrients. We aim to understand the presence of these nutrients within atmospheres that show the presence of water cloud condensates, potentially allowing the existence of aerial biospheres. In this paper we introduce a framework of nutrient availability levels based on the presence of water condensates and the chemical state of the CHNOPS elements. These nutrient availability levels are applied to a set of atmospheric models based on different planetary surface compositions resulting in a range of atmospheric compositions. The atmospheric model is a bottom-to-top equilibrium chemistry atmospheric model which includes the atmosphere-crust interaction and the element depletion due to the formation of clouds. While the reduced forms of CNS are present at the water cloud base for most atmospheric compositions, P and metals are lacking. This indicates the potential bio-availability of CNS, while P and metals are limiting factors for aerial biospheres.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetospheric conditions on the morphology of Jupiter's UV main auroral emission, as observed by Juno-UVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auroral emissions are a reflection of magnetospheric processes, and, at Jupiter, it is not entirely certain how the morphology of the UV main emission (ME) varies with magnetospheric compression or the strength of the central current sheet. This work leverages the observations from Juno-UVS to link ME variability with magnetospheric states. Novel arc-detection techniques are used to determine new reference ovals for the ME from perijoves 1 through 54, in both hemispheres, and analyse how the size and shape of the ME vary compared to this reference oval. The morphology and brightness of the ME vary in local time: the dawn-side ME is typically expanded and the dusk-side ME typically contracted compared to the reference oval, and the dusk-side ME being typically twice as bright as the dawn-side ME. Both the northern and southern ME, and the day-side and night-side ME, expand and contract from their reference ovals synchronously, which indicates that the variable size of the ME is caused by a process occurring throughout the jovian magnetosphere. The poleward latitudinal shift of the auroral footprint of Ganymede correlates with the poleward motion of the ME, whereas a similar relation is not present for the footprint of Io. Additionally, the expansion of the ME correlates well with an increase in magnetodisc current. These two results suggest that a changing current-sheet magnetic field is partially responsible for the variable size of the ME. Finally, magnetospheric compression is linked to a global ME contraction and brightening, though this brightening occurs predominantly in the day-side ME. This observation, and the observation that the dusk-side ME is typically brighter than the dawn-side ME, stands in contrast to the modelled and observed behaviour of field-aligned currents and thus weakens the theoretical link between field-aligned currents and the generation of the auroral ME.</description>

      <title>Aperture photometry on asteroid trails: detection of the fastest rotating near-Earth object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Near-Earth objects (NEOs) on an impact course with Earth can move at high angular speed. Understanding their properties, including rotation state, is crucial for assessing impact risks and mitigation strategies. Traditional photometric methods face challenges in collecting data on fast-moving NEOs accurately. Aims. This study introduces an innovative approach to aperture photometry tailored to analyzing trailed images of fast-moving NEOs. Our primary aim is to extract rotation state information from these observations, particularly focusing on the efficacy of this technique for fast rotators. Methods. We applied our approach to analyze the trailed images of three asteroids: 2023 CX1, 2024 BX1, and 2024 EF, which were either on a collision courses or performing a close fly-by with Earth. By adjusting aperture sizes, we controlled the effective exposure times to increase the sampling rates of the photometric variations. This enabled us to detect short rotation periods that would be challenging with conventional methods. Results. Our analysis revealed that trailed photometry significantly reduces overhead time associated with CCD read-out, enhancing the sampling rate of the photometric variations. We demonstrated that this technique is particularly effective for fast-moving objects, providing reliable photometric data when the object is at its brightest and closest to Earth. For asteroid 2024 BX1, we detected a rotation period as short as 2.5888 +- 0.0002 seconds, the fastest ever recorded. Our findings underscore the efficacy of trailed observations coupled with aperture photometry for studying the rotation characteristics of small NEOs, offering crucial insights for impact risk assessment and mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Into the thick of it: ALMA 0.45 mm observations of HL Tau at 2 au resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. To comprehend the efficiency of dust evolution within protoplanetary disks, it is crucial to conduct studies of these disks using high-resolution observations at multiple wavelengths with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Methods. In this work, we present high-frequency ALMA observations of the HL Tau disk using its Band 9 centered at a wavelength of 0.45 mm. These observations achieve the highest angular resolution in a protoplanetary disk to date, 12 milliarcseconds (mas), allowing the study of the dust emission at scales of 2 au. We use these data to extend the previously published multi-wavelength analysis of the HL Tau disk. Results. Our new 0.45 mm data traces mainly optically thick emission, providing a tight constraint to the dust temperature profile. We derive maximum particle sizes of $\sim$1 cm from the inner disk to $\sim$60 au. Beyond this radius, we find particles between 300 $\mu$m and 1 mm. Moreover, an intriguing asymmetry is observed at 32 au in the northeast inner part of the HL Tau disk at 0.45 mm. We propose that this asymmetry is the outcome of a combination of factors including the optically thick nature of the emission, the orientation of the disk, and a relatively large dust scale height of the grains. To validate this, we conducted a series of radiative transfer models using the RADMC-3D software. If this scenario is correct, our measured dust mass within 32 au would suggest a dust scale height H/R&gt; 0.08 for the inner disk. Finally, the unprecedented resolution allowed us to probe for the first time the dust emission down to a few au scales. We observed an increase in brightness temperature inside the estimated water snowline and speculate whether it could indicate the presence of a traffic jam effect in the inner disk.

      <title>Constraining stellar tidal quality factors from planet-induced stellar spin-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of tight star-planet systems is influenced by tidal interactions between the star and the planet, as was shown recently. The rate at which spins and orbits in such a system evolve depends on the stellar and planetary tidal dissipation efficiency. Here, we present a method to constrain the modified tidal quality factor $Q'_*$ of a planet-hosting star whose rotational evolution has been altered by its planet through angular momentum transfer from the planetary orbital motion to the rotation of the stellar convective zone. The altered rotation is estimated from an observed discrepancy of magnetic activity of the planet-hosting star and a coeval companion star, i.e. this method is applicable to star-planet systems with wide stellar companions. We give an example of the planet-hosting wide binary system HD189733 and find that the planet host's modified tidal quality factor is constrained to be $Q'_* \leq 2.33 \times 10^7$.</description>

Abstract: The Pampilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO) is located in the center of the continental Portuguese territory, in the heart of a certified Dark Sky destination by the Starlight Foundation (Aldeias do Xisto) and has been an instrumental asset to advance science, education and astrotourism certifications. PASO hosts astronomy and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities including a node of the Portuguese Space Surveillance \&amp; Tracking (SST) infrastructure network, such as a space radar currently in test phase using GEM radiotelescope, a double Wide Field of View Telescope system, a EUSST optical sensor telescope. These instruments allow surveillance of satellite and space debris in LEO, MEO and GEO orbits. The WFOV telescope offers spectroscopy capabilities enabling light curve analysis and cosmic sources monitoring. Instruments for Space Weather are being considered for installation to monitor solar activities and expand the range of SSA services.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Rapid Exploration in Close-Proximity of an Asteroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing number of space missions may overwhelm ground support infrastructure, prompting the need for autonomous deep-space guidance, navigation, and control (GN\&amp;C) systems. These systems offer sustainable and cost-effective solutions, particularly for asteroid missions that deal with uncertain environments. This study proposes a paradigm shift from the proposals currently found in the literature for autonomous asteroid exploration, which inherit the conservative architecture from the ground-in-the-loop approach that relies heavily on reducing uncertainties before close-proximity operations. Instead, it advocates for robust guidance and control to handle uncertainties directly, without extensive navigation campaigns. From a series of conservative assumptions, we demonstrate the feasibility of this autonomous GN\&amp;C for robotic spacecraft by using existing technology. It is shown that a bolder operational approach enables autonomous spacecraft to significantly reduce exploration time by weeks or months. This paradigm shift holds great potential for reducing costs and saving time in autonomous missions of the future.</description>

      <title>Shallow Encounters' Impact on Asteroid Deflection Prediction and Implications on Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical approximations are commonly employed in the initial trajectory design phase of a mission to rapidly explore a broad design space. In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</description>
