      <title>Wellposedness and averaging principle for conditional distribution dependent SDEs driven by standard Brownian motions and fractional Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a conditional distribution dependent stochastic differential equations driven by standard Brownian motion and fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent $H&gt;\frac{1}{2}$ simultaneously. First, the existence and uniqueness of the equation is established by the fixed point theorem. Then, we show that the solutions of conditional distribution dependent stochastic differential equations can be approximated by the solutions of the associated averaged distribution dependent stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volterra integral equations driven by $ G $-Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic Volterra integral equation driven by $G$-Brownian motion ($G$-SVIE). The existence, uniqueness and two types of continuity of the solution to $G$-SVIE are obtained. Moreover, combining a new quasilinearization technique with the two-step approximation method, we establish the corresponding comparison theorem for a class of $G$-SVIEs. In particular, by means of this method, the classical assumptions on partial derivatives of the coefficients are unnecessary.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for the fractional Magneto-Hydrodynamic equations driven by a degenerate pure jump noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the ergodicity for stochastic 2D fractional magneto-hydrodynamic equations on the two-dimensional torus driven by a highly degenerate pure jump L\'{e}vy noise. We focus on the challenging case where the noise acts in as few as four directions, establishing new results for such high degeneracy. We first employ Malliavin calculus and anticipative stochastic calculus to demonstrate the equi-continuity of the semigroup (or so-called the e-property), and then verify the weak irreducibility of the solution process. Therefore, the uniqueness of invariant measure is proven.</description>

      <title>The polynomial growth of effective resistances in one-dimensional critical long-range percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$, where an edge connects $i$ and $j$ independently with probability $1-\exp\{-\beta\int_i^{i+1}\int_j^{j+1}|u-v|^{-2}{\rm d} u{\rm d} v\}$ for $|i-j|&gt;1$ for some fixed $\beta&gt;0$ and with probability 1 for $|i-j|=1$. Viewing this as a random electric network where each edge has a unit conductance, we show that the effective resistances from 0 to $[-n,n]^c$ and from the interval $[-n,n]$ to $[-2n,2n]^c$ (conditioned on no edge joining $[-n,n]$ and $[-2n,2n]^c$) both grow like $n^{\delta(\beta)}$ for some $\delta(\beta)\in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-existence of the CLT for a family of SDEs driven by stable process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) without global Lipschitz drift often demonstrate unusual phenomena. In this paper, we consider the following SDE on $\mathbb R^d$:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d} \mathbf{X}_t=\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{X}_t) \mathrm{d} t+ \mathrm{d}\mathbf{Z}_t, \quad \mathbf{X}_0=\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d, \end{align*} where $\mathbf{Z}_t$ is the rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable process with $\alpha \in(1,2)$ and $\mathbf{b}:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is a differentiable function satisfying the following condition: there exist some $\theta \ge 0$, and $K_1 , K_2 , L&gt;0$, so that $$\langle \mathbf{b}(\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{y}), \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\rangle \leqslant K_1 |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|^2, \ \ \forall \ \ |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}| \leqslant L, $$ $$\langle \mathbf{b}(\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{y}), \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\rangle \leqslant -K_2 |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|^{2+\theta}, \ \ \forall \ \ |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}| &gt; L.$$ Under this assumption, the SDE admits a unique invariant measure $\mu$.
  We investigate the normal central limit theorem (CLT) of the empirical measures $$ \mathcal{E}_t^\mathbf{x}(\cdot)=\frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \delta_{\mathbf{X}_s }(\cdot) \mathrm{d} s, \ \ \ \ \mathbf{X}_0=\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ \ t&gt;0, $$ where $\delta_{\mathbf{x}}(\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta measure.
  Our results reveal that, for the bounded measurable function $h$, $$\sqrt t \left(\mathcal{E}_t^\mathbf{x}(h)-\mu(h)\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt t} \int_0^t \left(h\left(\mathbf{X}_s^\mathbf{x}\right)-\mu(h)\right) \mathrm{d} s$$ admits a normal CLT for $\theta \geqslant 0$. For the Lipschitz continuous function $h$, the normal CLT does not necessarily hold when $\theta=0$, but it is satisfied for $\theta&gt;1-\frac{\alpha}{2}$.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Proof for Stable Fluctuations in the Extremal Process of Branching Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a probabilistic proof for the emergence of the Stable-$1$ Law for the random fluctuations of the mass of the extremal process of branching Brownian Motion away from its tip. This result was already shown by Mytnik et al. albeit using PDE techniques. As a consequence, we demystify the origin of these fluctuations and the meaning of the deterministic centering function required.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of densities of SDEs using the Fourier analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show regularity properties of local densities of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with the Fourier analytic approach. With this simple method, statements that were previously derived with approaches using Malliavin calculus or difference operators can be recovered and extended to include regularity properties with respect to the time variable. For example, we derive the H\"older continuity and joint continuity of local densities in the case of drift coefficients that are locally piecewise H\"older continuous. To this end, we derive fairly general bounds for the Fourier transform of the local density of a solution of the SDE when the drift is locally bounded and the diffusion is locally sufficiently regular.</description>

      <title>The Principles of Probability: From Formal Logic to Measure Theory to the Principle of Indifference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a formal system of inductive logic. It uses an infinitary language that allows for countable conjunctions and disjunctions. It is based on a set of nine syntactic rules of inductive inference, and contains classical first-order logic as a special case. We also provide natural, probabilistic semantics, and prove both $\sigma$-compactness and completeness.
  We show that the whole of measure-theoretic probability theory is embedded in this system of inductive logic. The semantic models of inductive logic are probability measures on sets of structures. (Structures are the semantic models of finitary, deductive logic.) Moreover, any probability space, together with a set of its random variables, can be mapped to such a model in a way that gives each outcome, event, and random variable a logical interpretation. This embedding, however, is proper. There are scenarios that are expressible in this system of logic which cannot be formulated in a measure-theoretic probability model.
  The principle of indifference is an idea originating with Laplace. It says, roughly, that if we are "equally ignorant" about two possibilities, then we should assign them the same probability. The principle of indifference has no rigorous formulation in probability. It exists only as a heuristic. Moreover, its use has a problematic history and is prone to apparent paradoxes. Within inductive logic, however, we formulate it rigorously and illustrate its use through a number of examples.
  Many of the ideas in inductive logic have counterparts in measure theory. The principle of indifference, however, does not. Its formulation requires the structure of inductive logic, both its syntactic structure and the semantic structures embedded in its models. As such, it exemplifies the fact that inductive logic is a strictly broader theory of probability than any that is based on measure theory alone.</description>

      <title>A Numerical scheme to approximate the solution of the planar Skorokhod embedding problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework to approximate the $\mu$-domain in the planar Skorokhod embedding problem (PSEP), recently appeared in \cite{gross2019}. Our approach investigates the continuity and convergence properties of the solutions with respect to the underlying distribution $\mu$. We establish that, under weak convergence of a sequence of probability measures $(\mu_n)$ with bounded support, the corresponding sequence of $\mu_n$-domains converges to the domain associated with $\mu$, limit of $(\mu_n)$. We derive explicit convergence results in the $L^1$ norm, supported by a generalization using the concept of $\alpha_p$-convergence. Furthermore, we provide practical implementation techniques, convergence rate estimates, and numerical simulations using various distributions. The method proves robust and adaptable, offering a concrete computational pathway for approximating $\mu$-domains in the PSEP.</description>

      <title>An Aldous-Hoover type representation for row exchangeable arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an array of random variables, each row can be regarded as a single, sequence-valued random variable. In this way, the array is seen as a sequence of sequences. Such an array is said to be row exchangeable if each row is an exchangeable sequence, and the entire array, viewed as a sequence of sequences, is exchangeable. We give a representation theorem, analogous to those of Aldous and Hoover, which characterizes row exchangeable arrays. We then use this representation theorem to address the problem of performing Bayesian inference on row exchangeable arrays.</description>

      <title>Moment estimates for solutions of SPDEs with L\'evy colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we continue the investigations initiated by the first author in Balan (2015) related to the study of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with L\'evy colored noise on $\mathbb{R}_{+} \times \mathbb{R}^d$. This noise is constructed from a L\'evy white noise (which is in turn built from a Poisson random measure with intensity $dtdx \nu(dz)$), using the convolution with a suitable spatial kernel $\kappa$. We assume that the L\'evy measure $\nu$ has finite variance. Therefore, the stochastic integral with respect to this noise is constructed similarly to the integral with respect to the spatially-homogeneous Gaussian case considered in Dalang (1999). Using Rosenthal's inequality, we provide an upper bound for the $p$-th moment of the stochastic integral with respect to the L\'evy colored noise, which allows us to identify sufficient conditions for the solution of an SPDE driven by this noise to have higher order moments. We first analyze this question for the linear SPDE, considering as examples the stochastic heat and wave equations in any dimension $d$, for three examples of kernels $\kappa$: the heat kernel, the Riesz kernel, and the Bessel kernel. Then, we present a general theory for a non-linear SPDE with Lipschitz coefficients, and perform a detailed analysis in the case of the heat equation (in dimension $d\geq 1$), and wave equation (in dimension $d\leq 3$), for the same kernels $\kappa$. We show that the solution of each of these equations has a finite upper Lyapounov exponent of order $p\geq 2$, and in some cases, is weakly intermittent (in the sense of Foondun and Khoshnevisan, 2013). In the case of the parabolic/hyperbolic Anderson model with L\'evy colored noise, we provide the Poisson chaos expansion of the solution and the explicit form of the second-order Lyapounov exponent.</description>

      <title>On the small mass limit of stochastic wave equation driven by cylindrical stable process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the small mass limit of a stochastic wave equation (SWE) driven by cylindrical $\alpha$-stable noise, where $\alpha\in (1,2)$, and prove that it converges to a stochastic heat equation. We establish its well-posedness, and in particular, the c\`adl\`ag property, which is not trivial in the infinite dimensional case. Using a splitting technique, we decompose the velocity component into three parts, which gives convenience to the moment estimate. We show the tightness of solution of SWE by verifying the infinite dimensional version of Aldous condition. After these preparation, we pass the limit and derive the approximation equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-term behaviour of critical multitype branching processes conditioned on non-extinction, both with respect to the forward and the ancestral processes. Forward in time, we prove a functional limit theorem in the space of trajectories of the linearly-scaled $h$-transformed process; the change of measure allows us to work on the same probability space for all times. Backward in time, we trace the lines of descent of individuals sampled from a (stationary) population and analyse the ancestral type distribution, that is, the type distribution of the ancestors in the distant past, as well as the type process along the ancestral line.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic diameter of preferential attachment model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic diameter of the preferential attachment model $\operatorname{PA}\!_n^{(m,\delta)}$ with parameters $m \ge 2$ and $\delta &gt; 0$. Building on the recent work \cite{VZ25}, we prove that the diameter of $G_n \sim \operatorname{PA}\!_n^{(m,\delta)}$ is $(1+o(1))\log_\nu n$ with high probability, where $\nu$ is the exponential growth rate of the local weak limit of $G_n$. Our result confirms the conjecture in \cite{VZ25} and closes the remaining gap in understanding the asymptotic diameter of preferential attachment graphs with general parameters $m \ge 1$ and $\delta &gt;-m$. Our proof follows a general recipe that relates the diameter of a random graph to its typical distance, which we expect to have applicability in a broader range of models.</description>

      <title>Martingale problem of the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the martingale formulation of the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation (SHE) at criticality. The main theorem proves an exact recursive-type equation that expresses the covariation measures of the SHE in terms of the solutions via an integro-multiplication operator. As an application, the quadratic variations of the martingale parts in the mild form are proven explicitly expressible in the solutions of the SHE and the two-dimensional two-body delta-Bose gas semigroups. The proofs are based on the standard approximations of the two-dimensional SHE at criticality, and now we analyze asymptotic expansions of the covariation measures of the approximate solutions in the limit. Also, new bounds for certain mixed moments of the fourth order of the approximate solutions are among the main tools for a priori estimates.</description>

      <title>On point interactions in two dimensions via additive functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By taking the viewpoint of Brownian additive functionals, we extend an existing approximation theorem of the two-dimensional Laplacian singularly perturbed at the origin. The approximate operators are defined by adding a rescaled function to the two-dimensional Laplacian such that the support of the perturbation thus produced converges to a point in the limit of the rescaling, and we also impose suitable renormalizations of the coupling constants. The first main theorem assumes the zero total mass of the function for rescaling and proves limits of the approximate resolvents up to an extended criticality defined by two levels of phase transitions. The second main theorem handles the case of positive total mass of the function for rescaling and proves an asymptotic expansion of a multivariate density induced by the approximate resolvent. Moreover, this expansion is valid beyond criticality.</description>

      <title>The Metric Dimension of Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2013, Bollob\'as, Mitsche, and Pralat at gave upper and lower bounds for the likely metric dimension of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $G(n,p)$ for a large range of expected degrees $d=pn$. However, their results only apply when $d \ge \log^5 n$, leaving open sparser random graphs with $d &lt; \log^5 n$. Here we provide upper and lower bounds on the likely metric dimension of $G(n,p)$ from just above the connectivity transition, i.e., where $d=pn=c \log n$ for some $c &gt; 1$, up to $d=\log^5 n$. Our lower bound technique is based on an entropic argument which is more general than the use of Suen's inequality by Bollob\'as, Mitsche, and Pralat, whereas our upper bound is similar to theirs.</description>

      <title>Ultra-discretization of Yang-Baxter maps, probability distributions and independence preserving property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied in arXiv:0911.2895 . Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the Sibuya discrete probability distribution, which serves as the basis and the main instrument for numerical simulations of Grunwald--Letnikov fractional derivatives by the Monte Carlo method. We provide three methods for simulating the Sibuya distribution. We also introduce the Sibuya-like sieved probability distributions, and apply them to numerical fractional-order differentiation. Additionally, we use the Monte Carlo method for evaluating fractional-order integrals, and suggest the notion of the continuous Sibuya probability distribution. The developed methods and tools are illustrated by examples of computation. We provide the MATLAB toolboxes for simulation of the Sibuya probability distribution, and for the numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Concentration of mean exit times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean exit time function defined on the $\delta$-tube around any equator $\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \subseteq \mathbb{S}^{n}$ of the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n}$, ($0&lt;\delta&lt;\pi/2$), goes to infinity with the dimension, so that when we consider a Brownian particle that begins its motion at one equator of the sphere, this particle will remain near this equator for an almost infinite amount of time when the dimension of the sphere goes to infinity. On the other hand, if the Brownian particle begins its motion at the North pole, then this particle will leave quickly, when the dimension of the sphere goes to infinity, any geodesic ball with radius $\delta &lt;\pi/2$, centered at this point. Namely, the mean exit time function defined on the equatorial tubes presents a kind of {\em concentration} phenomenon or {\em fat equator} effect, as it has been described in the book \cite{MS}.
  Moreover, the same concentration phenomenon occurs when we consider this mean exit time function defined on tubes around closed and minimal hypersurfaces of a compact Riemannian $n$-manifold $M$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below, ${\rm Ric}_{M}\geq (n-1)$. Namely, a Brownian particle that begins its random movement around a closed embedded minimal hypersurface of a compact $n$-manifold $M$ with ${\rm Ric}_{M}\geq (n-1)$ will wanders arbitrarily close to the hypersurface for a time that approaches infinity as the dimension of the ambient manifold does so as well.</description>

      <title>Approximation and regularity results for the Heston model and related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis explores approximations and regularity for the Heston stochastic volatility model through three interconnected works.
  The first work focuses on developing high-order weak approximations for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process, essential for financial modelling but challenging due to the square root diffusion term preventing standard methods. By employing the random grid technique (Alfonsi &amp; Bally, 2021) built upon Alfonsi's (2010) second-order scheme, the work proves that weak approximations of any order can be achieved for smooth test functions. This holds under a condition that is less restrictive than the famous Feller's one. Numerical results confirm convergence for both CIR and Heston models and show significant computational time improvements.
  The second work extends the random grid technique to the log-Heston process. Two second-order schemes are introduced (one using exact volatility simulation, another using Ninomiya-Victoir splitting under a the same restriction used above). Convergence to any desired order is rigorously proven. Numerical experiments validate the schemes' effectiveness for pricing European and Asian options and suggest potential applicability to multifactor/rough Heston models.
  The third work investigates the partial differential equation (PDE) associated with the log-Heston model. It extends classical solution results and establishes the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions without relying on the Feller condition. Uniqueness is proven even for certain discontinuous initial data, relevant for pricing instruments like digital options. Furthermore, the convergence of a hybrid numerical scheme to the viscosity solution is shown under relaxed regularity (continuity) for the initial data.
  An appendix includes supplementary results for the CIR process.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Weighted Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several resource allocation settings involve agents with unequal entitlements represented by weights. We analyze weighted fair division from an asymptotic perspective: if $m$ items are divided among $n$ agents whose utilities are independently sampled from a probability distribution, when is it likely that a fair allocation exist? We show that if the ratio between the weights is bounded, a weighted envy-free allocation exists with high probability provided that $m = \Omega(n\log n/\log\log n)$, generalizing a prior unweighted result. For weighted proportionality, we establish a sharp threshold of $m = n/(1-\mu)$ for the transition from non-existence to existence, where $\mu\in (0,1)$ denotes the mean of the distribution. In addition, we prove that for two agents, a weighted envy-free (and weighted proportional) allocation is likely to exist if $m = \omega(\sqrt{r})$, where $r$ denotes the ratio between the two weights.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Anderson operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the continuous Anderson operator $H=\Delta+\xi$ on a two dimensional closed Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{S}$. We provide a short self-contained functional analysis construction of the operator as an unbounded operator on $L^2(\mathcal{S})$ and give almost sure spectral gap estimates under mild geometric assumptions on the Riemannian manifold. We prove a sharp Gaussian small time asymptotic for the heat kernel of $H$ that leads amongst others to strong norm estimates for quasimodes. We introduce a new random field, called Anderson Gaussian free field, and prove that the law of its random partition function characterizes the law of the spectrum of $H$. We also give a simple and short construction of the polymer measure on path space and relate the Wick square of the Anderson Gaussian free field to the occupation measure of a Poisson process of loops of polymer paths. We further prove large deviation results for the polymer measure and its bridges.</description>

Abstract: Let $d \geq 2$, $\alpha \in (0,2)$, and $X$ be the rectilinear $\alpha$-stable process on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We first present a geometric characterization of an open subset $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ so that the part process $X^D$ of $X$ in $D$ is irreducible. We then study the properties of the transition density functions of $X^D$, including the strict positivity property as well as their sharp two-sided bounds in $C^{1,1}$ domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our bounds are shown to be sharp for a class of $C^{1,1}$ domains.</description>

      <title>Triviality of the scaling limits of critical Ising and $\varphi^4$ models with effective dimension at least four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any scaling limit of a critical reflection positive Ising or $\varphi^4$ model of effective dimension $d_{\text{eff}}$ at least four is Gaussian. This extends the recent breakthrough work of Aizenman and Duminil-Copin -- which demonstrates the corresponding result in the setup of nearest-neighbour interactions in dimension four -- to the case of long-range reflection positive interactions satisfying $d_{\text{eff}}=4$. The proof relies on the random current representation which provides a geometric interpretation of the deviation of the models' correlation functions from Wick's law. When $d=4$, long-range interactions are handled with the derivation of a criterion that relates the speed of decay of the interaction to two different mechanisms that entail Gaussianity: interactions with a sufficiently slow decay induce a faster decay at the level of the model's two-point function, while sufficiently fast decaying interactions force a simpler geometry on the currents which allows to extend nearest-neighbour arguments. When $1\leq d\leq 3$ and $d_{\text{eff}}=4$, the phenomenology is different as long-range effects play a prominent role.</description>

Abstract: We study the concept of (generalized) $p$-th variation of a real-valued continuous function along a general class of refining sequence of partitions. We show that the finiteness of the $p$-th variation of a given function is closely related to the finiteness of $\ell^p$-norm of the coefficients along a Schauder basis, similar to the fact that H\"older coefficient of the function is connected to $\ell^{\infty}$-norm of the Schauder coefficients. This result provides an isomorphism between the space of $\alpha$-H\"older continuous functions with finite (generalized) $p$-th variation along a given partition sequence and a subclass of infinite-dimensional matrices equipped with an appropriate norm, in the spirit of Ciesielski.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop sample path large deviations for multivariate Hawkes processes with heavy-tailed mutual excitation rates. Our results address a broad class of rare events in Hawkes processes at the sample path level and, via the cluster representation of Hawkes processes and a recent result on the tail asymptotics of the cluster sizes, unravel the most likely configurations of (multiple) large clusters that could trigger the target events. Our proof hinges on establishing the asymptotic equivalence, in terms of M-convergence, between a suitably scaled multivariate Hawkes process and a coupled L\'evy process with multivariate hidden regular variation. Hence, along the way, we derive a sample path large deviations principle for a class of L\'evy processes with multivariate hidden regular variation, which not only plays an auxiliary role in our analysis but is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On a class of unbalanced step-reinforced random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A step-reinforced random walk is a discrete-time stochastic process with long-range dependence. At each step, with a fixed probability $\alpha$, the so-called positively step-reinforced random walk repeats one of its previous steps, chosen randomly and uniformly from its entire history. Alternatively, with probability $1-\alpha$, it makes an independent move. For the so-called negatively step-reinforced random walk, the process is similar, but any repeated step is taken with its direction reversed. These random walks have been introduced respectively by Simon (1955) and Bertoin (2024) and are sometimes refered to the self-confident step-reinforced random walk and the counterbalanced step-reinforced random walk respectively. In this work, we introduce a new class of unbalanced step-reinforced random walks for which we prove the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. In particular, our work provides a unified treatment of the elephant random walk introduced by Schutz and Trimper (2004) and the positively and negatively step-reinforced random walks.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$, and let $\phi$ be a strictly plurisubharmonic function on $\Omega$. For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, we consider determinantal point process $\Lambda_k$ with kernel $K_{k\phi}$, where $K_{k\phi}$ is the reproducing kernel of infinite dimensional weighted Bergman space $H(k\phi)$ with weight $e^{-k\phi}$. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function for $\Lambda_k$ converges as $k\rightarrow\infty$ to a certain limit, which can be explicitly expressed in terms of $\phi$ and a test function $u$. Note that we need to restrict the type of test function $u$ to those that are $\phi$-admissible.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time mean field games: a primal-dual characterization</title>

Abstract: This paper establishes a primal-dual formulation for continuous-time mean field games (MFGs) and provides a complete analytical characterization of the set of all Nash equilibria (NEs). We first show that for any given mean field flow, the representative player's control problem with {\it measurable coefficients} is equivalent to a linear program over the space of occupation measures. We then establish the dual formulation of this linear program as a maximization problem over smooth subsolutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which plays a fundamental role in characterizing NEs of MFGs. Finally, a complete characterization of \emph{all NEs for MFGs} is established by the strong duality between the linear program and its dual problem. This strong duality is obtained by studying the solvability of the dual problem, and in particular through analyzing the regularity of the associated HJB equation.
  Compared with existing approaches for MFGs, the primal-dual formulation and its NE characterization do not require the convexity of the associated Hamiltonian or the uniqueness of its optimizer, and remain applicable when the HJB equation lacks classical or even continuous solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of (Stochastic) Lagrangian Trajectories for Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories associated with Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. First, in the vanishing viscosity limit, we establish sharp non-uniqueness results for positive solutions to transport equations advected by weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations that exhibit kinetic energy dissipation with $C_{t,x}^{1/3-}$ regularity. As a corollary, in conjunction with the superposition principle, this yields the non-uniqueness of associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectories. Second, in dimension $d\geq2$, for any $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{r}&gt;1$ or $p\in(1,2),r=\infty$, we construct solutions to the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations in the space $L_t^rL^p\cap L_t^1W^{1,1}$, demonstrating that the associated (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. Our result is sharp in 2D in the sense that: (1) in the stochastic case, for any vector field $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$, the associated stochastic Lagrangian trajectory associated with $v$ is unique (see \cite{KR05}); (2) in the deterministic case, the LPS condition guarantees that for any weak solution $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$ to the Navier-Stokes equations, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique. Our result is also sharp in dimension $d\geq2$ in the sense that for any divergence-free vector field $v\in L_t^1W^{1,s}$ with $s&gt;d$, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique (see \cite{CC21}).</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations are widely used to model irreversible processes in complex systems in physics. Recently, it has been studied that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We refer to these manifolds as finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations in probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, as well as Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a simplex set with a three-point lattice.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorems: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969). In this work, we develop a new approach towards effectivising the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods extend to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). In addition, we prove a central limit theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vladimirov-Pearson Operators on $\zeta$-regular Ultrametric Cantor Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new operator for certain types of ultrametric Cantor sets is constructed using the measure coming from the spectral triple associated with the Cantor set, as well as its zeta function. Under certain mild conditions on that measure, it is shown that it is an integral operator similar to the Vladimirov-Taibleson operator on the p-adic integers. Its spectral properties are studied, and the Markov property and kernel representation of the heat kernel generated by this so-called \emph{Vladimirov-Pearson} operator is shown, viewed as acting on a certain Sobolev space. A large class of these operators have a heat kernel and a Green function explicitly given by the ultrametric wavelets on the Cantor set, which are eigenfunctions of the operator.</description>
