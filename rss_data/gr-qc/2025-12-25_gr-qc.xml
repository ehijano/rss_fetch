      <title>Spinning extremal dyonic black holes in $\gamma=1$ Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for the study of asymptotically flat spinning dyonic {\it extremal} black holes (eBHs) in $D=4$ Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. Restricting to the stringy value $\gamma=1$ of the dilaton coupling constant, we report on the existence of a one parameter family of eBHs which are free of pathologies, provided their magnetic and electric charges are equal. An understanding of this condition is found from a study of the near horizon limit of the solutions, both perturbative closed form and numerical solutions being presented.</description>

      <title>Comparing next-generation detector configurations for high-redshift gravitational wave sources with neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coming decade will be crucial for determining the final design and configuration of a global network of next-generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, including the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\mathrm{d}} &gt; 100$ M$_\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.</description>

      <title>Visualization and analysis of the curvature invariants in the Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime, we investigate the following scalar curvature invariants: the scalar $I$, derived from a quadratic contraction of the Weyl tensor, the trace $R$ of the Ricci tensor, and the quadratic $r1$ and cubic $r2$ invariants from the trace-adjusted Ricci tensor. In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble. Additionally, we delve into the Kretschmann quadratic invariant decomposition. We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn. The paper addresses potential misconceptions about the Alcubierre warp-drive due to inaccuracies in representing spacetime curvature changes and clarifies the classification of the Alcubierre spacetime, emphasizing its distinction from class $B$ warped product spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The space spinor formalism and estimates for spinor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the space spinor formalism for 2-component spinors can be used to construct estimates for spinor fields satisfying first order equations. We discuss the connection of the approach presented in this article with other strategies for the construction of estimates. In addition, we recast several concepts related to the notion of hyperbolicity in the context of spinor equations. The approach described in this article can be regarded as an adaptation to first order equations of the method of positive commutators for second order hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic dynamical analysis of $f(R,T^{\phi}) = R+\alpha T^{\phi} + \beta (T^{\phi})^2/2$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the asymptotic cosmological dynamics of a modified gravity model based on the $f(R,T^\phi)$ theory, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^\phi$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor of a scalar field. Despite the extensive study of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology remain largely unexplored. We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^\phi) = R + \alpha T^\phi + \beta (T^\phi)^2/2$, in which the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $\alpha \neq 0$ and $\beta \neq 0$, along with the subcases $\alpha = 0$ and $\beta = 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $\alpha = \beta = 0$. We find that the quadratic term in $T^\phi$ admits late-time accelerated de Sitter-like critical solutions at the background level. However, several accelerated points lie in a degenerate scalar sector with $Q_s=0$, where the standard linear perturbation criteria are inconclusive, while the quasi-de Sitter point with $Q_s&gt;0$ is of saddle type. Therefore, establishing full perturbative viability requires going beyond the linear analysis in the degenerate sector.</description>

      <title>Geometric Approach to Light Rings in Axially Symmetric Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular photon orbits have become an attractive topic in recent years. They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties. The development of analytical methods for these circular orbits has also drawn extensive attention. In our recent work, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L021501}{Phys. Rev. D \textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons).</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as a correlated qubit system via entropic identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic behaviours of multi-horizon black holes such as a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole have been one of the long-standing mysteries in gravitational physics since they involve quantum natures in gravitational systems and that the search for quantum gravity has not reached its conclusion. In this work, we seeked for a possibility of realising the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as a correlated qubit system, where each of the event horizon is treated as a qubit and both of them are correlated in a way that two qubits could be. By identifying the entropies of subsystems to those of qubits, we successfully constructed the reduced density matrices of the two subsystems as well as the density matrix for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, modelled as 2-correlating qubits. Moreover, our results suggested that when the gravitational effect has its role in the qubit systems, supposedly like black holes, the correlation between qubits are constrained with a lower bound more stringent than the so-called Araki-Lieb triangle inequality.</description>

      <title>Universality and Criticality in Mass-less Scalar Field Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we observe the collapse of a mass-less scalar field covariantly. We show that the strengths of the collapsing and dispersing modes of this scalar field will decide whether the collapse will end up in a black-hole or disperse. We find a locally naked null singularity as a critical case between these two and confirm that there is a single dimensionless parameter that determine the end state. This work is ansatz-independent, hence, true for all mass-less scalar field families. We also show that the geometrical mass of these singularities go to zero.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation Driven by Non-Thermal Squeezing Through SNS and CSNS Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in a spatially flat FRW Universe for two fundamental nonclassical states: the Squeezed Number State (SNS) and the Coherent Squeezed Number State (CSNS). Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $\rho$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $\rho$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $\Delta \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $\Delta \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations. These findings contribute a new perspective on gravitational particle creation in cosmological settings.</description>

      <title>A class of entangled and diffeomorphism-invariant states in loop quantum gravity: Bell-network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell-network states constitute a class of diffeomorphism-invariant and entangled states of the geometry within loop quantum gravity (LQG) that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in the limit of large spins. The fluctuations of the geometry for a Bell-network state are entangled, similar to those in the semiclassical limit as described by quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. This analysis provides a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory.</description>

      <title>Acoustic gravitational waves from primordial curvature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard perturbative calculations of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) have neglected nonperturbative effects in the large-amplitude regime. We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>(Lovelock)$^2$ inflation: explaining the ACT data and equivalence to Higgs-Gauss-Bonnet inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Starobinsky model of inflation in light of recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which indicates a potential preference for a slightly larger scalar spectral index $n_s$ than predicted by the standard $R^2$ scenario. We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\frac{\alpha}{4}{\cal G}$ ($\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $\alpha$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities. This work establishes the quadratic $f(L)$ gravity as a compelling and physically motivated extension that preserves the successes of Starobinsky inflation while improving its fit to modern precision cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Linking interior curvature to observable shadows: A case study of nonsingular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a direct connection between the interior curvature structure of nonsingular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core and their observable optical signatures. By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters {\alpha} and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Preliminary forecasting constraint on scalar charge with LISA in non-vacuum environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational wave signal from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded within beyond-vacuum environments, where the secondary object carries a scalar charge and evolves in the presence of both an accretion disk and a dark matter halo. The waveform modification is derived by incorporating the scalar charge correcting the fluxes and orbital trajectories of the secondary. Our results indicate that, under suitable parameter configurations, the influence of the scalar charge on EMRIs waveform in such environments can be distinguished from that in vacuum spacetime. For the EMRIs signal modified by the astrophysical environments, the future space-borne detector can determine the relative error of scalar charge constrained by LISA at the level of $\sim0.1$, providing a preliminary prediction of detecting scalar charge in the beyond-vacuum spacetime.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Euclidean Solutions of the Constraint Equations with Prescribed Asymptotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.</description>

      <title>When Geometry Radiates Review: Gravitational Waves in Theory, Cosmology, and Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the nature of higher dimensional operators generated by quantum gravity. Calculating the tree-level and one-loop effective operators generated by graviton exchange between fields of the standard model and those of a hidden sector, we show that the leading order operators generated by quantum gravity are non-local dimension 6 operators. Dimension 5 operators are not generated by perturbative (weak field) effects, although they might be generated by strong field effects such as Planck-scale fluctuations in spacetime. We investigate the consequences of our findings for models of ultralight scalar dark matter.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough on dynamical higgs mechanism for dRGT gravity: Example in which graviton gains mass through electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive gravity is an interesting theoretical framework capable of explaining among others things cosmological IR (infra-red) phenomena like late-time cosmic acceleration. Unfortunately, it turned out to be very difficult of getting consistent massive gravity theory due, among other things, to ghost appearance and strong coupling break-down problems. Of course, even though since the work of de Rham, Gabadadge and Tolley; the ghost problem appears overcame; things remain unchanged for the strong coupling break-down problem which is the problem that a massive gravity of experimentally viable graviton mass $m$ has (in comparison of standard massless gravity theory) a very low cutoff-scale $\Lambda_3= \Big[m^2M_P\Big]^{\frac{1}{3}}$ above which the theory fails; a problem what must be resolved if we want massive gravity be a consistent physical theory which can pretend to describe nature. Now as we know, one of the better way of overcoming this strong coupling break-down problem of massive gravity is to have a dynamical Higgs mechanism for gravity capable of providing a clear-cut way of making the graviton massless dynamically above the cutoff-scale $\Lambda_3$; a challenge what turned out to be difficult to surmount. It is this difficult that I overcome in the present paper by showing that it is quite possible of getting a four-dimensional modified massless gravity theory which becomes dynamically massive through for example the dynamical standard model electroweak phase transition. More precisely, I propose the first example of dynamical Higgs mechanism for dRGT gravity permitting to overcome the strong coupling break-down problem of dRGT gravity.</description>

      <title>Emergent Gravity from a Spontaneously Broken Gauge Symmetry: a Pre-geometric Prospective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the paradigm of pre-geometric gravity, where spacetime geometry and the gravitational field are not fundamental but emerge from the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a larger gauge symmetry. Specifically, we consider a gauge theory based on the de Sitter $SO(1,4)$ or anti-de Sitter $SO(3,2)$ group, formulated on a manifold without a prior metric structure. General covariance is maintained by constructing Lagrangian densities using the Levi-Civita symbol. The SSB is triggered by an internal vector field $\phi^A$, which reduces the symmetry to the Lorentz group $SO(1,3)$ and dynamically generates a spacetime metric. We analyze two specific models: the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation, which yields the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a cosmological constant and a Gauss-Bonnet term, and the Wilczek model, which produces a pure Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In both cases, the observed Planck mass and the small cosmological constant emerge from a see-saw mechanism dependent on the symmetry-breaking scale. We then present the Hamiltonian formulation of this pre-geometric theory, demonstrating that it possesses three number of physical degrees of freedom, corresponding to a massless graviton and a massive scalar. Integrating out the massive scalar, the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian of General Relativity is obtained after SSB. This establishes a foundational bridge between pre-geometric theories and canonical quantum gravity approaches like Loop Quantum Gravity, and allows for the formulation of a pre-geometric Wheeler-DeWitt equation.</description>

      <title>Probing Stringy Horizons with Pole-Skipping in Non-Maximal Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study pole-skipping in non-maximally quantum chaotic systems. Using Rindler conformal field theories and the large-$q$ SYK chain as illustrative examples, we argue that the pole-skipping points of few-body operators organize into trajectories in the complex frequency-momentum plane, with the leading trajectory encoding the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using unitarity and causality, we derive an infinite tower of two-sided positivity bounds on the effective field theory coefficients which describe the propagation of heavy fields on de Sitter spacetime. We design this EFT to describe propagators with the in-in boundary conditions that are relevant for cosmological correlators. Our positivity bounds therefore identify EFT correlators that can never emerge from a consistent underlying model of inflation. This implies non-trivial constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity; for instance the cosmological collider oscillations in the squeezed bispectrum from the exchange of a heavy scalar are tied to the shape of its EFT background.</description>

      <title>A single-cut discontinuity for cosmological correlators from unitarity and analyticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive discontinuity relations, also known as cutting rules, and explore the analytic properties of cosmological correlators, fundamental observables of the primordial universe. Our emphasis is on how these relations arise from unitarity and hermitian analyticity in interacting quantum field theories on de Sitter space-time. Instead of analyzing wave-function coefficients, we apply these relations directly to cosmological correlators. By studying conformally coupled and massless scalar fields with $\phi^n$ self-interactions, we demonstrate that the discontinuity of a cosmological correlator can be expressed as a sum of products of lower-point discontinuities, stemming from a single-cut of one internal line in the corresponding tree-level exchange Witten diagram. Notably, beyond lower-point correlators, the decomposition of the discontinuities of cosmological correlators includes contributions from auxiliary elements that consist of both the real and imaginary parts of the lower-point wave-function coefficients, which have not been reported in the existing literature. Interestingly, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd in a $\phi^n$ interaction, these different lower-point discontinuities contribute as the leading or sub-leading piece in the late-time limit to the discontinuity relations. Additionally, our single-cut discontinuity relation leads to a decomposition rule for the residue of the cosmological correlators at partial energy singularities, incorporating contributions from these auxiliary objects. Through explicit calculations in several models, we confirm that our discontinuity relations are consistent with results from the in-in formalism. While primarily developed using tree-level exchanges with polynomial interactions, we also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to include loop corrections and cases with derivative interactions.</description>

      <title>A remarkably simple covariant graviton propagator in (Anti-)de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present remarkably simple covariant expressions for the graviton and ghost propagators in Anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter spacetimes valid in any spacetime dimension. In gravity there is a $2$-parameter family of covariant gauge-fixing conditions and the simplification occurs for a special choice of these parameters. In this gauge the graviton propagator satisfies $\nabla^\mu\mu\nabla^\nu\mu \, G_{\mu\nu,\alpha'\beta'}(\mu)=0$, where $\mu$ is the geodesic distance between two points, and this condition implies an improved IR behavior. This gauge choice is not possible in flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Echoes of $R^3$ modification and Goldstone preheating in the CMB-BAO landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $R^2$ and the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation are disfavored by the observed high spectral index $n_s$ from the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at the $\sim2\sigma$ level. The addition of a dimension-six $R^3$ term in the action helps alleviate this tension. We show that the parameter space accounting for the observed high $n_s$ also induces rapid Goldstone and Higgs preheating. The preheating, especially from Goldstone modes, helps match the CMB and inflationary scales, which in turn supports the observed $n_s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that black holes decohere any quantum superpositions in their vicinity. This decoherence is mediated by soft radiation through the horizon, and can be understood as the result of the fact that quantum states in the exterior source distinguishable states of long-range fields in the interior. To study this phenomenon and others, we extend Tomita-Takesaki theory to accommodate states of soft radiation such as arise in the electromagnetic and gravitational memory effects, and provide a general framework for computing the distinguishability of general coherent states. Applying these tools, we use the methods of unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction to prove some new relations regarding the distinguishability of quantum states, and the quantum information content of soft radiation, and thereby show that a black hole (or any horizon) decoheres its environment as though its interior were full of optimal observers.</description>

Abstract: Dilatonic black hole dyon-like solutions in the gravitational
  $4d$ model with a scalar field, two 2-forms, two dilatonic coupling constants
  $\lambda_i \neq 0$, $i =1,2$, obeying $\lambda_1 \neq - \lambda_2$
  and the sign parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$ for scalar field kinetic term
  are overviewed. Here $\varepsilon = - 1$ corresponds to a phantom scalar field.
  The solutions are defined up to solutions of two master equations for two moduli functions, when
  $\lambda^2_i \neq 1/2$ for $\varepsilon = - 1$. Several integrable cases
  corresponding to Lie algebras $A_1 + A_1$, $A_2$, $B_2 = C_2$ and $G_2$ are considered.
  Some physical parameters of the solutions are derived:
  gravitational mass, scalar charge, Hawking temperature, black hole area entropy and
  PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Bounds on the gravitational mass
  and scalar charge (based on a certain conjecture) are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian comparison between thawing quintessence and a cosmological constant, incorporating theoretically motivated priors on the phenomenological Pad\'e-w parameters used to model thawing dynamics. We find that thawing quintessence is consistently preferred over a cosmological constant when combining BAO data from DESI DR2 and CMB data from Planck+ACT with any of the major supernova compilations, including the recently updated DES-Dovekie sample. This preference is not sensitive to our choice of prior, but it is contingent on the inclusion of supernovae in the analysis. We comment on the consistency between various information criteria and Bayesian evidence ratios, finding that the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) tracks the Bayesian evidence more reliably than either the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, we use observational likelihoods to identify which thawing trajectories are compatible with the available data, independently of theoretical priors.</description>

      <title>Considering lensing effect on gravitational wave signals from black holes in mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $\mu=12.2$ for GW190521 and $\mu=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap.</description>

      <title>GW241011 and GW241110: Hints of Hierarchical Mergers from the Merger Entropy Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW241011 and GW241110 both exhibit extremely asymmetric masses, high primary spins, and significant spin-orbit misalignment, which challenge the formation of first-generation binary black hole mergers formed from stellar collapse. This implies that these two gravitational wave events might originate from the hierarchical merger mechanism, with at least one of the black holes being the remnant of a previous merger. Here we investigate the origin of hierarchical mergers for GW241011 and GW241110 using the merger entropy index which measures the efficiency of entropy transfer for binary black hole mergers in general relativity. We find that GW241011 is consistent with hierarchical mergers in dense star clusters. The origin of GW241110 remains under debate due to its large distribution uncertainty, which leads to method-dependent inference and should be taken into account when interpreting this event in terms of hierarchical mergers.</description>

      <title>Black hole as a multipartite entangler: multi-entropy in AdS${}_3$/CFT${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multipartite entanglement in typical pure states holographically dual to pure BTZ black holes, using multi-entropy and its ``genuine'' version. In the bulk, these quantities are computed by minimal geodesic networks (so-called Steiner trees). We find that at sufficiently high temperature, the genuine tripartite multi-entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling in sharp contrast to vacuum AdS$_3$, where the genuine contribution is universal and size-independent. Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$. As a byproduct, we also observe an intriguing ``area-law'' contribution to multi-entropy that is relevant to vacuum AdS${}_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields, focusing on the evolution of the photon intensity and polarizations induced by conversion into axions. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields characterized by the power spectra of their helical/non-helical components, we express the expectation values and variances of the photon intensity and linear/circular polarizations after conversion in terms of these spectra. We find nontrivial dependencies of these statistical quantities on the characteristic magnetic field correlation length, the propagation distance, and the axion mass. Moreover, we find that nontrivial polarizations emerge even if the photons are initially unpolarized, that the variances of these observables become suppressed in specific frequency regions, and that a peak structure arises in the expectation value of the circular polarization in the presence of statistically helical magnetic fields. We also point out consistency relations among these statistical quantities that hold independently of the specific forms of the magnetic field power spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a gravitational open extension of the effective field theory of inflation in the Schwinger-Keldysh framework. While physical symmetries allow many open operators in the Schwinger-Keldysh action, most of them overconstrain the equations of motion, yielding inconsistent dynamics. We identify the minimal open operators compatible with propagating scalar and tensor modes and build the gravitational action, recovering dissipative models of inflation.</description>

      <title>Exact Infrared Triangle in Massless sQED with Long-range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The logarithmic soft photon theorem in four spacetime dimensions encodes an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts on massive matter as a divergent superphaserotation. Here we extend this result to massless matter which is both more subtle and surprising. We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge. We furthermore compute the infrared corrections to the charge associated to the subleading tree-level soft photon theorem. As a corollary of our result, we find that the tail to the velocity kick memory due to the long-range interactions between soft electromagnetic radiation and massless matter vanishes.</description>

      <title>Deforming and dissecting AdS$_3$ with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of the model by Henneaux, Mart\'inez, Troncoso and Zanelli [arXiv:hep-th/0201170] which features asymptotically AdS$_3$ black hole solutions that incorporate the exact backreaction of a scalar field. The presence of bulk matter causes the $T \overline T$ deformation of the (putative) dual CFT$_2$ to differ from the deformation defined in the bulk by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at finite radius. We work out both of these deformations explicitly and verify that $T \overline T$-deforming the boundary theory corresponds to imposing mixed boundary conditions on the metric at the conformal boundary, whereas the bulk "Dirichlet deformation" gives rise to a field theory deforming operator that includes $T \overline T$ as well as other irrelevant terms. We check our results by calculating the deformed energy spectrum for either case using both the bulk and boundary prescriptions, finding agreement after taking into account additional terms coming from the flow of the scalar source. We interpret our explicit results and compare them with the predictions of similar proposals in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the crossing symmetry of the ensemble of large-$c$ 2D CFTs defined through 3D gravity. A central observation is that statistical moments of OPE coefficients are not independent; rather, lower and higher moments are strongly correlated. Using Virasoro TQFT, we clarify how these correlations arise and how they guarantee consistency across OPE channels. Our analysis introduces the new notion of pseudo-hyperbolic manifolds, which are a certain class of non-hyperbolic manifolds whose partition functions are nevertheless related to those of hyperbolic ones. These manifolds serve as bridges that help manifest the crossing symmetry of the CFT ensemble.</description>

      <title>Testing conformal gravity using the supermassive black hole NGC 4258</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a Bayesian statistical fit to estimate the free parameters of a nonsingular black hole in conformal gravity by employing megamaser astrophysical data of the supermassive black hole hosted at the center of the active galactic nucleus of NGC 4258. This estimation has been carried out by taking into account a general relativistic approach, which makes use of the positions on the sky of the photon sources and the frequency shift observations from the water megamaser system in circular motion around the black hole. Within the framework of conformal gravity, a way to eliminate the singularity at r = 0 from the Schwarzschild spacetime is by introducing a conformal factor characterized by a length scale parameter l and an integer parameter N. Therefore, the spacetime geometry depends on the mass of the black hole, and the conformal gravity parameters l and N. In this work, we estimate the mass-to-distance ratio M/D and the length scale ratio l/D with fixed values of the integer parameter N = 1, 2, considering the geodesics of conformally/non-conformally coupled massive particles. This method leads to posterior Gaussian distributions for all parameters, thus yielding a most probable value for the parameter l for both conformally/non-conformally coupled particles, in contrast to previous constraints based on X-ray astrophysical data, where an upper bound for the parameter l has been established. Furthermore, we obtain new physical properties regarding the existence of the ISCO radius for this nonsingular spacetime in the case of non-conformally coupled particles.</description>

      <title>Black holes in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled with Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario of black holes coupled with the Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electromagnetic field in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. The black hole solutions for electrically charged, magnetically charged and the dyonic case are separately analyzed, and we discuss the scalar curvature and the energy conditions of the black hole spacetime. In the magnetic charge solution, the $f(R,T)$ correction appears in the $1/r^6$ Euler-Heisenberg electromagnetic field correction term, while the electrically charged black hole solution exhibits an $r^2$ term in the metric function, corresponding to an effective cosmological constant $\Lambda_\text{eff} = \beta/(3\pi)$, inducing asymptotically anti-de Sitter or de Sitter spacetimes depending on the sign of the coupling parameter $\beta$. The dyonic solution is obtained through vacuum polarization quantum electrodynamics corrections, where electromagnetic duality is broken and the solution contains higher-order correction terms. The relationship between the event horizon and charge of dyonic extreme black holes is studied. Furthermore, we investigate the effective metric, photon trajectories, and innermost stable circular orbit under nonlinear electromagnetic effects, providing images of photon geodesic for varying electric and magnetic charge strengths and $f(R,T)$ coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Non-Abelian Anyon Condensates: Implications for the Information Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model black holes as condensates of non-Abelian anyons forming a thin, topologically ordered, timelike shell located just outside the would-be horizon, while the interior settles into a regular, effectively empty constant-curvature vacuum. The horizon degrees of freedom are described by a finite, constrained fusion Hilbert space whose dimension, together with a quantized area spectrum, reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and yields logarithmic and inverse-area corrections. To characterize the shell's thermodynamics, we introduce an effective collective Hamiltonian with global constraint modes; fluctuations of these constrained modes generate a logarithmic entropy correction that is consistent with the corrections obtained from area quantization. Combining the fusion-state degeneracy with the discrete area spectrum leads to a nonuniform, discrete black-hole mass spectrum and a corresponding thermally weighted emission profile. The Hawking temperature is recovered at leading order from classical equipartition on the shell, with systematic corrections controlled by the discrete spectrum. Quantum information is stored nonlocally in the fusion channels of the condensate, providing a finite microscopic Hilbert space for horizon degrees of freedom without explicitly invoking bulk trans-horizon entanglement. To address formation and consistency, we embed the shell in conformal gravity, used as an effective classical framework in the high-curvature regime, and construct a local, nonsingular matching between the regular interior, the shell, and a Schwarzschild-like exterior. The framework implies microscopic spectral discreteness and, for weak shell reflectivity, the possibility of late-time gravitational-wave echoes. Overall, our results provide a concrete microscopic model for black-hole thermodynamics and connect horizon microphysics to ideas from topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\Lambda$CDM with Higher-Order GUP Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario, analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2 release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative, which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy description.</description>

      <title>Overdamped quasibound states inside a Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. In the geometric optics approximation, waves follow null geodesics to the singularity. However, outside the geometric optics regime, the behavior of wave propagation can be rich and nuanced, even in such extreme habitats. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that decay before reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological implications of a class of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-minimal matter-geometry coupling is considered. The theory contains a metric curvature tensor, together with a curvature tensor constructed from an independent affine connection. We will show that the model could be written as a bi-scalar-tensor gravity with a non-minimal coupling between matter sector and a scalar field. The theory will then be confronted with observational data from Cosmic Chronometers, BAO dataset from DESI and the Pantheon$^+$ dataset. We will show that the theory could be a good alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model with the difference that the conservation of the baryonic matter sector holds only at the background level. The statefinder analysis will also be applied to the theory and it is observed that the DE behavior of the theory exhibits a quintessence to phantom transition occurs at redshifts around $z\approx0.86$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quartic-divergent vacuum energy poses an ultraviolet (UV) challenge (the cosmological constant problem) in probing the nature of dark energy. Here we try to evaluate the contribution of the vacuum energy to dark energy with a method of the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Then, we explore an effective description via scale decoupling. The parameter spaces suggest that the vacuum energy of active neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV $(10^{-3}$ eV) is expected. The normal ordering neutrinos are preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Noether's second theorem and the energy-momentum tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through symmetry of the action under global spacetime translations, Noether's first theorem infamously entails an energy-momentum tensor (EMT) that is neither symmetric nor gauge-invariant. In a prior work [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], I had obtained a symmetric and gauge-invariant EMT by using Noether's second theorem instead, with local spacetime translations as the symmetry group. However, the derivation therein was flawed, containing a faulty assumption about the transformation rule for spinor fields. In this work, I revisit the derivation of [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], both correcting the faulty step and simplifying the derivation for broader accessibility. The end result is an EMT for quantum chromodynamics that is gauge-invariant, but not symmetric.</description>

      <title>Can cosmic rotation resolve the Hubble tension? Constraints from CMB and large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a relativistic cosmological model with background rotation, sourced by a non-perfect fluid with anisotropic stress. A modified version of the CLASS Boltzmann code is employed to perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain analyses against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and late-time datasets. The results show that current CMB data constrain the present-day rotation parameter to be negligible. As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3 measurement. Combining CMB, SNe and BAO data confirms the preference for non-rotation.</description>

      <title>Noncritical Conformal Gravity and Four-Dimensional Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum aspects of the conformal gravity in four dimensions, specifically addressing a known discrepancy in beta functions between general quadratic curvature theories and conformal gravity, which corresponds to two scalar degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly. Finally we give the condition that the BRST transformation is anomaly free.</description>

      <title>Singular $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</description>

      <title>Is Dark Energy Dynamical in the DESI Era? A Critical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the recent DESI DR2 measurements provide or not evidences for dynamical dark energy by exploring the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model and its extensions with free $\sum m_{\nu}$ and $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Using a comprehensive MCMC analysis with a wide range of cosmological datasets including DESI~DR2 BAO and Ly$\alpha$ data, CMB compressed likelihoods, BBN, cosmic chronometers, and multiple Type~Ia supernova compilations, we assess the statistical preference for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Holographic Tensor Networks as Tessellations of Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic tensor networks serve as toy models for the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, capturing many of its essential features in a concrete manner. However, existing holographic tensor network models remain far from a complete theory of quantum gravity. A key obstacle is their discrete structure, which only approximates the semi-classical geometry of gravity in a qualitative sense. In \cite{Lin:2024dho}, it was shown that a network of partial-entanglement-entropy (PEE) threads, which are bulk geodesics with a specific density distribution, generates a perfect tessellation of AdS space. Moreover, such PEE-network tessellations can be constructed for more general geometries using the Crofton formula. In this paper, we assign a quantum state to each vertex in the PEE network and develop two holographic tensor network models: the factorized PEE tensor network, which takes the form of a tensor product of EPR pairs, and the random PEE tensor network. In both models we reproduce the exact Ryu-Takayanagi formula by showing that the minimal number of cuts along a homologous surface in the network exactly computes the area of this surface.</description>
