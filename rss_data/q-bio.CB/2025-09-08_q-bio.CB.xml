      <title>Determining a parabolic-elliptic-elliptic system by boundary observation of its non-negative solutions under chemotaxis background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a profoundly challenging inverse problem that has remained largely unexplored due to its mathematical complexity: the unique identification of all unknown coefficients in a coupled nonlinear system of mixed parabolic-elliptic-elliptic type using only boundary measurements. The system models attraction-repulsion chemotaxis--an advanced mathematical biology framework for studying sophisticated cellular processes--yet despite its significant practical importance, the corresponding inverse problem has never been investigated, representing a true frontier in the field. The mixed-type nature of this system introduces significant theoretical difficulties that render conventional methodologies inadequate, demanding fundamental extensions beyond existing techniques developed for simpler, purely parabolic models. Technically, the problem presents formidable obstacles: the coupling between parabolic and elliptic components creates inherent analytical complications, while the nonlinear structure resists standard approaches. From an applied perspective, the biological relevance adds another layer of complexity, as solutions must maintain physical interpretability through non-negativity constraints. Our work provides a complete theoretical framework for this challenging problem, establishing rigorous unique identifiability results that create a one-to-one correspondence between boundary data and the model's parameters. We demonstrate the power of our general theory through a central biological application: the full parameter recovery for an attraction-repulsion chemotaxis model with logistic growth, thus opening new avenues for quantitative analysis in mathematical biology.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.</description>
