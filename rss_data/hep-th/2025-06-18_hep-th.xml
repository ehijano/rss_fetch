      <title>On the scalar tachyons creation in noncommutative de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tachyon production in noncommutative de Sitter space by solving the deformed Klein-Gordon equation. Using the Bogoliubov transformation method, we compute the number density of created scalar tachyons and demonstrate that their spectrum follows a thermal distribution. Our analysis reveals that noncommutativity reduces the effective temperature of tachyon production, analogous to its effect on ordinary particle creation. Furthermore, we establish that the role of the noncommutative parameter in tachyon production is functionally equivalent to that of an electric field in standard particle production in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>FTheoryTools: Advancing Computational Capabilities for F-Theory Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary goal of string phenomenology is to identify realistic four-dimensional physics within the landscape of string theory solutions. In F-theory, such solutions are encoded in the geometry of singular elliptic fibrations, whose study often requires particularly challenging and cumbersome computations. In this work, we introduce FTheoryTools, a novel software module integrated into the OSCAR computer algebra system, designed to automate the complex and tedious tasks involved in F-theory model building. Key features of FTheoryTools include the enumeration of G4-fluxes, the capability to perform blowups on arbitrary (including non-toric) loci, and a literature database of existing F-theory constructions employing a MaRDI-based data format for enhanced collaboration and reproducibility. As a demonstration of its power, we present a stress test by applying FTheoryTools to the challenging F-theory geometry with most flux vacua (arXiv:1511.03209). Our results illustrate the potential of FTheoryTools to streamline F-theory research and pave the way for future developments in the computational study of string phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Geometry of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum structure of a quantum field theory is a crucial property. In theories with extended symmetries, such as supersymmetric gauge theories, the vacuum is typically a continuous manifold, called the vacuum moduli space, parametrized by the expectation values of scalar fields. Starting from the R-parity preserving superpotential at renormalizable order, we use Gr\"obner bases to determine the explicit structure, as an algebraic variety, of the vacuum geometry of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. Gr\"obner bases have doubly exponential computational complexity (for this case, $7^{2^{1023}}$ operations); we exploit symmetry and multigrading to render the computation tractable. This geometry has three irreducible components of complex dimensions $1$, $15$, and $29$, each being a so-called rational variety. The defining equations of the components express the solutions to F-terms and D-terms in terms of the gauge invariant operators and are interpreted in terms of classical geometric constructions.</description>

      <title>R-symmetries, anomalies and non-invertible defects from non-BPS branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a holographic realization of symmetry operators for symmetries associated to isometries in terms of non-BPS Kaluza-Klein monopoles. Their existence is supported by dualities, and their action can be inferred by consistency with well-known String Theory constructions. We use our proposal to describe the $U(1)$ superconformal R-symmetry of the Klebanov-Witten 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory dual to Type IIB String Theory on $AdS_5\times T^{1,1}$. We precisely reproduce the expectations from field theory, including the 't Hooft self-anomaly of the R-symmetry and the mixed 't Hooft anomaly with the baryonic symmetry. For a choice of boundary conditions, the R-symmetry becomes non-invertible and the worldvolume action for the non-BPS Kaluza-Klein monopole precisely accounts for this.</description>

      <title>The Vacuum Moduli Space of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A starting point in the study of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is the vacuum moduli space, which is a highly complicated algebraic variety: it is the image of an affine variety $X \subset \mathbb{C}^{49}$ under a symplectic quotient map $\phi$ to $\mathbb{C}^{973}$. Previous work computed the vacuum moduli space of the electroweak sector; geometrically this corresponds to studying a restriction of $\phi$: $\mathbb{C}^{13} \stackrel{\phi^{\texttt{res}}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{C}^{22}$. We analyze the geometry of the full vacuum moduli space for superpotentials $W_{\rm minimal}$ (without neutrinos) and $W_{\rm MSSM}$ (with neutrinos) in $\mathbb{C}^{973}$. In both cases, we prove that $X$ consists of three irreducible components $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$, and determine the images $M_i$ of the $X_i$ under $\phi$. For $W_{\rm minimal}$ we show they have, respectively, dimensions $1$, $15$, and $29$, and prove that each of the $M_i$ is a rational variety, while for $W_{\rm MSSM}$ we show that $M_3$ is the only component. Restricting the $M_i$ to the electroweak sector, we recover known results. We describe the components of the vacuum moduli space geometrically in terms of incidence varieties to a product of Segre varieties.</description>

      <title>Decorating Asymptotically Flat Space-Time with the Moduli Space of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N=2, 4 and 8 supersymmetric string theories in four dimensional flat space-time have moduli space of vacua. We argue that starting from a theory where the moduli approach a particular moduli space point A at infinity, we can construct a classical solution that contains an arbitrarily large space-time region where the moduli take values corresponding to any other moduli space point B of our choice to any desired accuracy. Therefore the observables of a theory with a given set of asymptotic values of the moduli will have complete information on the observables for any other asymptotic values of the moduli. Also it is physically impossible for any experiment, performed over a finite time, to determine the asymptotic values of the moduli. We point out the difference between asymptotically flat space-time and asymptotically AdS space-time in this regard and discuss the possible implication of these results for holographic duals of string theories in flat space-time. For N=2 supersymmetric theories, A and B could correspond to compactifications on topologically distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds related by flop or conifold transitions.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Graviton Spectra in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM via BMN truncation and S-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-loop cohomology of N=4 SYM is conjectured to be isomorphic to the exact cohomology. As a result, its truncations are expected to be subrings of the exact cohomology. We study the superconformal index restricted over one such truncation known as the BMN truncation. We present a systematic algorithm to compute the BMN index using the method of residues. We compute the BMN index for SU(N) SYM for N = 2,...,6 in closed form. It is expressed as a rational function of the fugacity. A term of the type (1-x) in the denominator indicates the presence of a bosonic generator counted with fugacity x. We find a rich and universal set of such terms in the denominator showing an interesting bosonic Fock space in the spectrum of protected operators. This Fock space cannot be explained as coming from the non-interacting supersymmetric graviton gas far away from the black hole as in the grey-galaxy solutions because the charges of the bosonic generators are not compatible with those of the supersymmetric gravitons. This suggests a novel microstructure within the supersymmetric black hole itself. We also examine the indices of S-dual pairs SO(2N+1) and Sp(N) SYM. Although their full 1/16-BPS indices coincide, we find discrepancies in their BMN-sector indices. As the BMN indices restricted to the graviton sector are expected to be the same, this mismatch allows us to identify non-graviton cohomologies. We explicitly find one of them in the SO(7) theory that is responsible for the mismatch of the BMN index. We also show that indices restricted to other one-loop cohomology truncations, in general, do not match under S-duality. If the conjecture of exactness of one-loop cohomology is correct, this suggests the presence of new cohomology subrings that match under S-duality with the letter-based truncations of the one-loop cohomology. This offers a way to check the one-loop exactness conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum detection of boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum detection of spacetime conicity was investigated in reference [Phys. Lett. B 820, 136482 (2021)] through the analysis of the response function of an Unruh-deWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field. In particular, it was shown that the detector can discern the presence of the deficit angle of a region of spacetime even when it is placed on a flat region with no conical deficit and (due to the rapid switching on and off) is classically isolated from the conical region. The scalar field was supposed to be continuous at the three dimensional timelike hypersurface connecting both regions and it was argued that the non-trivial effects on the response function were only due to the deficit angle of the outer conical region. In this paper, we study the response function of the Unruh-deWitt detector on the same classical framework, but exploring the effects of the choice of boundary conditions for the scalar field at the connecting hypersurface. These boundary conditions are extracted from the two-interval Sturm-Liouville theory and each one gives rise to a physically inequivalent sensible dynamics for the quantum field. We show that they play an important role on the response function of the detector, which effectively ``feels'' the combined effect of conicity + boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of point-particle dynamics on higher-spin backgrounds: massive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, we showed that massless scalar point particles cannot propagate on classical backgrounds of chiral higher-spin theory. This conclusion was derived from the analysis of the light-cone consistency conditions occurring at the second order in interactions. In the present paper, we extend this result to the case of massive particles, showing that these cannot propagate on chiral higher-spin backgrounds either. In order to do that, we use a different and more direct approach, which does not rely on special simplifications occurring for massless particles. Namely, we solve the light-cone consistency conditions at the given order in complete generality and then show that all the Hamiltonians found are inevitably non-local. We emphasise connections between the resulting procedure and the on-shell methods applied to worldline scattering observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangians which transform homogeneously under a global transformation of the fields (a global rescaling, for instance) can be written on-shell as a total derivative which has a universal, solution-independent expression, using a functional version of the Euler theorem for homogeneous functions. We study the uniqueness of this expression and how this result can be used in the construction of generalized Komar charges.</description>

      <title>A revision to the QES prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a revision to the Quantum Extremal Surface (QES) prescription, which plays a crucial role in describing the entanglement entropy of black holes. While derivations exist for the original QES prescription using the replica trick, they rely on a saddle point approximation that faces challenges when the number of replicas approaches unity. We highlight these challenges and derive a refined formula for the entanglement entropy that incorporates a weighted summation over multiple surfaces, contrasting the QES prescription's reliance on a single extremal surface. We validate our formulation by demonstrating consistency with expected results for both the early and late stages of black hole evaporation, confirming its alignment with the unitary evolution depicted by the Page curve.</description>

      <title>Exact expressions for the 5-Point Liouville conformal block with a level-two degenerate field insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate 5-point Liouville conformal block with a level 2 degenerate field insertion. Our main tool is the BPZ differential equation, which, upon placing three of the insertions at the standard positions $\infty$, $1$, and $0$, reduces to a linear differential equation which is of order two in the degenerate insertion point $z$, and order one in the remaining point $x$. In a previous paper, it was conjectured that the solution could be expressed in terms of a single hypergeometric function and its derivative, with coefficients computable via recursive relations up to the desired order $x^k$. In this paper, we simplify these recursion relations and provide a rigorous inductive proof of the conjecture.
  Our representation of the 5-point conformal block readily facilitates the connection between various analyticity regions through classical connection formulae for the hypergeometric function.
  In the quasi-classical limit, the 5-point BPZ equation reduces to the Heun equation. Consequently, we recover a recently proposed representation of the Heun equation in terms of a single hypergeometric function, which has proven to be highly effective in the analysis of gravitational perturbation of black holes.</description>

      <title>Holography of a novel codimension-2 defect CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a new holographic duality between a non-supersymmetric defect conformal field theory (dCFT) and its gravity dual. On the gravity side, the defect is realised by a novel solution of a D5 probe brane embedded in the $AdS_5\times S^5$ geometry. The D5 brane wraps an $S^2\subset S^5$ and accommodates $k$ units of flux through the $S^2$. The symmetry of the induced on the brane metric is $AdS_3\times S^1\times S^2$. The brane ends on an $\mathbb{R}^{(1,1)}$ subspace of the 4-dimensional $AdS_5$ boundary resulting to a codimension-2 defect. We first prove that our brane configuration is stable by showing that the masses of all the fluctuations of the transverse to the brane coordinates respect the B-F bound. On the field theory side, the 2-dimensional defect is described by a classical solution whose precise form we determine. Subsequently, we calculate the one-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor and of the chiral primary operators (CPOs), first at strong and then at weak coupling. In an appropriate limit, we find compelling agreement between the weak and strong coupling results. Furthermore, we also extract one of the B-type Weyl anomaly coefficients.</description>

      <title>Spinning the Probe in Kerr with WQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational scattering of a spinning probe mass in a Kerr background using the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) approach. This corresponds to the leading term (0SF) in the gravitational self-force expansion for the spinning two-body problem with large mass hierarchy. By reformulating the geodesic and Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations as a recursive Berends-Giele type equation known from multi-gluon scattering, we develop a novel integration-by-parts formalism on the worldline that enables systematic computation of scattering observables - specifically the impulse and spin kick - to arbitrary orders in Newton's constant and spin. Here, the transition to a position space formalism is key. We present explicit results up to and including the physical 7PM order, thereby incorporating all relevant higher-spin and higher-curvature terms on the worldline, advancing beyond previous calculations. This work represents an initial step to reconceptualise the gravitational self-force expansion through worldline quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Structure of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ chiral algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral algebra of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SU$(N)$ super-Yang-Mills theory is an $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal vertex operator algebra. We analyse the structure of this algebra by studying recursively the constraints that are required by the associativity of the operator product expansion. We find that the algebra is uniquely characterized by the central charge (which can take an arbitrary value), without any additional free parameter. Furthermore, the truncation pattern of the OPE coefficients suggests that the algebra cannot arise from the symmetric orbifold.</description>

      <title>Higher loops in AdS: applications to boundary CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space provides a natural framework for studying boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). We analyze the conformal boundary conditions of the critical O$(N)$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions using the $\epsilon$-expansion, and extract some BCFT observables through higher-loop calculations in AdS. Specifically, in the so-called "ordinary" universality class, we determine the free energy to four-loop order and the one-point function of the lightest O$(N)$ singlet operator to three-loop order. In the symmetry breaking "normal" universality class, we derive the two-loop free energy and compute the leading correction to the one-point function of the lightest O($N$) vector. We apply Pad\'e approximants to extract the corresponding conformal data in three dimensions. In particular, from a suitable dimensional continuation of the free energy in AdS, we obtain estimates for the boundary central charge of the BCFT in $d=3$.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing features of longitudinal magnetoconductivity for a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The band-degeneracy points in the Brillouin zones of chiral crystals exist in multiple avatars, with the high-symmetry points being able to host multifold nodes of distinct characters. A class of such crystals, assisted by the spin-orbit coupling, harbours fourfold degeneracy in the form of Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl node (RSWN) at the $\Gamma$-point. Our aim is to explore the nature of longitudinal magnetoconductivity, arising from applying collinear electric and magnetic fields, for such systems. Adjusting the chemical potential to lie near the intrinsic energy-location of the RSWN, the multifold nature of the RSWN is revealed by an interplay of intraband and interband scatterings, which would not arise in twofold degeneracies like the conventional Weyl nodes. The current study fills up the much-needed gap in obtaining the linear response from an exact computation, rather than the insufficient relaxation-time approximation employed earlier.</description>

      <title>Cosmological effect of coherent oscillation of ultralight scalar fields in a multicomponent universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea that coherent oscillations of a scalar field, oscillating over a time period that is much shorter than the cosmological timescale, can exhibit cold dark matter (CDM) like behavior was previously established. In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop Hamiltonian mechanics on Aristotelian manifolds, which lack local boost symmetry and admit absolute time and space structures. We construct invariant phase space dynamics, define free Hamiltonians, and establish a generalized Liouville theorem. Conserved quantities are identified via lifted Killing vectors. Extending to kinetic theory, we show that the charge current and stress tensor reproduce ideal hydrodynamics at leading order, with the ideal gas law emerging universally. Our framework provides a geometric and dynamical foundation for systems where boost invariance is absent, with applications including but not limited to: condensed matter, active matter and optimization dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of rotating viscous stars, using the causal relativistic hydrodynamics of Bemfica, Disconzi, Kovtun, and Noronha. We derive, in a slow-rotation approximation, a coupled system of equations describing the propagation of axial gravitational waves through the star, which couple to internal viscous modes. We show that rotating viscous stars amplify incoming low-frequency gravitational waves, a phenomenon which we argue to be universal. Superradiant amplification does not seem to trigger an instability for uniformly rotating stars, even if the object is compact enough to have light rings.</description>

      <title>Two Higgs Doublet Solutions to the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the strong CP problem in a broad class of two Higgs doublet theories that will be probed at the Large Hadron Collider and at future colliders.These theories feature CP and Abelian flavor symmetries, both broken softly in the scalar potential, that yield realistic quark masses and mixings. The flavor symmetry charges are chosen so that $\bar{\theta}=0$ at tree level for all values of the Yukawa and quartic couplings of the theory. We prove that in all such theories the 1-loop contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ also vanishes, independently of the mass scale of the second Higgs doublet. We study two illustrative models with flavor group $\mathbb{Z}_3$. The direct contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment are negligible in both models. While the 2-loop contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ is less than $10^{-12}$ in one model, it can be as large as $10^{-10}$ in the other, yielding the prospect of a signal in planned experiments. Even with Abelian flavor symmetries, CP violation in neutral kaon mixing is generally expected to yield naturalness bounds on the masses of additional Higgs doublets of order 20 TeV. We prove that for all models in our class, where the flavor symmetry forces $\bar{\theta}$ to vanish at tree-level, the flavor-changing neutral currents are CP-conserving, yielding model-dependent bounds from neutral meson mixing near 1 TeV. Mixing of the two CP-even scalars gives corrections to the couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs state to $\bar{t}t, \bar{b}b, \bar{c}c, \bar{\tau}\tau$ and $\bar{\mu} \mu$, giving possible signals at high luminosity runs at LHC and at future colliders. Furthermore, distinctive correlations between corrections in the various channels can probe the underlying flavor symmetry.</description>

      <title>The fast, the slow and the merging: probes of evaporating memory burdened PBHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called memory-burden effect implies that evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) inevitably stabilize before complete decay. This stabilization opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter below $10^{15}\,$g. The transition to the memory-burdened phase is not instantaneous but unfolds over cosmological timescales, with some PBHs entering this phase in the present epoch. Additionally, a fraction of PBHs undergo mergers today, forming ''young'' semiclassical black holes that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. Both processes generate fluxes of stable astrophysical particles, which are constrained by current measurements of high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. Moreover, the steep increase in energy injection at higher redshifts perturbs the ionization history of the Universe, leading to complementary bounds from observations of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. We find that the reopened window enabled by the memory-burden effect is largely within reach of detection, both locally and across cosmological distances. We further describe how our findings restrict the values of the critical exponent characterizing the memory burden phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study modifications of gravitational wave observables, such as the wave amplitude and frequency, which follow from the quantum equivalence principle, and are expressed in terms of the inertial, gravitational and rest masses of the LIGO/Virgo mirrors. We provide bounds on the violations of the quantum equivalence principle by comparing the results with the most resolved gravitational wave events observed by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The formalism is equally applicable to other future ground and space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physically motivated model of dark energy (DE) rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE emerges as the Universe expands, from the difference in vacuum energy between the expanding Universe and Minkowski spacetime, driven by QCD vacuum topological sectors. This leads to a modification of the dark energy term in the Friedmann equation, which then scales with the Hubble parameter as $\rho_{\rm DE}(t) \propto H(t)$ when dark energy dominates the expansion of the Universe. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \sim 100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally sets the energy density of DE and provides a compelling explanation for why its impact on cosmic expansion becomes significant only in the recent cosmological epoch. Importantly, the entire framework is grounded in Standard Model (SM) physics, involving no new fields or coupling constants. Key predictions of the model include: (a) A present-day DE equation of state $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$, asymptotically approaching the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ in the future, with the corresponding asymptotic Hubble constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) At redshifts $z \ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}$ can lie above or below $-1$ and may cross this boundary multiple times, behavior qualitatively consistent with recent DESI observations. (c) The solution to the Friedmann equation in this framework can deviate from the canonical $\Lambda$CDM form at $z \ge 0$. (d) If such deviation occurs, it can be tested using cosmological observations, CMB anisotropies, BAO, SNIa, and large-scale structure, which we propose to explore in future work. (e) Finally, we point out a potential connection between our framework and the observed $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states with N photons added can significantly enhance the conversion probability.</description>

      <title>The refined local Donaldson-Thomas theory of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the $K$-theoretically refined Donaldson-Thomas theory of local curves. Our results avoid degeneration techniques, but rather exploit direct localisation methods to reduce the refined Donaldson-Thomas partition function to the equivariant intersection theory of skew nested Hilbert schemes on smooth projective curves. We show that the latter is determined, for every Young diagram, by three universal series, which we compute in terms of the 1-leg $K$-theoretic equivariant vertex. In the refined limit, our results establish a formula for the refined topological string partition function of local curves proposed by Aganagic-Schaeffer. In the second part, we show that analogous structural results hold for the refined Pandharipande-Thomas theory of local curves. As an application, we deduce the K-theoretic DT/PT correspondence for local curves in arbitrary genus, as conjectured by Nekrasov-Okounkov.
  Thanks to the recent machinery developed by Pardon, we expect our explicit results on local curves to play a key role towards the proof of the refined GW/PT conjectural correspondence of Brini-Schuler for all smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

Abstract: We compute the fixed-order distribution of the non-global hemisphere mass observable in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation up to four loops for various sequential recombination jet algorithms. In particular, we focus on the $k_t$ and Cambridge/Aachen algorithms. Using eikonal theory and strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons, we determine the complete structure of both abelian (clustering) and non-abelian non-global logarithms through four loops in perturbation theory. We compare the resulting resummed expressions for both jet algorithms with the standard Sudakov form factor and demonstrate that neglecting these logarithms leads to unreliable phenomenological predictions for the observable's distribution.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the relation between covariantly conserved currents and Noether's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On one hand, proper conservation laws, that is, the existence of local functions of the fields whose divergence vanishes on-shell, are associated with global symmetries and are a consequence of Noether's first theorem. On the other hand, covariant conservation laws, i.e., the same type of laws but featuring a covariant divergence, are associated with local symmetries and are a consequence (under certain conditions) of Noether's second theorem. In this paper, we clarify under which conditions Noether's second theorem, which is mostly known for providing relations between the equations of motion of a theory that possesses some local symmetries, can be used to generate covariantly conservation laws. We also investigate the relation between the conserved current of a theory with global symmetry and the covariantly conserved current of the corresponding local symmetry. We treat these issues using only the tools of Calculus, in the fashion of Noether's original article, avoiding the somewhat complicated mathematical tools that plague much of the literature on this topic, thus making the article readable for the general physicist.</description>

Abstract: Black holes gradually settle into their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, whose amplitude diminish over time according to a power-law decay at fixed spatial locations. We show that the nonlinear tails in the presence of a quadratic source, which have been recently found to potentially dominate over the linear ones, can be simply derived from the AdS$_2$$\times$S$^2$ spacetime perspective with their amplitudes being related to the Aretakis constants.</description>

      <title>Certified randomness from quantum speed limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum speed limits are usually regarded as fundamental restrictions, constraining the amount of computation that can be achieved within some given time and energy. Complementary to this intuition, here we show that these limitations are also of operational value: they enable the secure generation of certified randomness. We consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with some (experimentally determined or promised) upper bound on the energy uncertainty of the average prepared quantum state, but without any further assumptions on the devices, Hilbert space or Hamiltonian. Given that we can freely choose the time at which to apply the untrusted preparation procedure, we show that this scenario admits the generation of randomness that is secure against adversaries with additional classical information. We show how to determine the amount of certified randomness given the observed correlations, discuss how interactions with the environment are taken into account, and sketch a conceivable experimental implementation. Remarkably, even single-mode coherent states admit this kind of certification of non-zero randomness in some parameter regimes, reinforcing ongoing approaches to demonstrate versions of nonclassicality in the simple harmonic oscillator. Our results extend existing efforts to devise semi-device-independent protocols grounded in reasonable physical assumptions, and they contribute to the understanding of time-energy uncertainty relations via their operational consequences.</description>

      <title>Topological Contextuality and Quantum Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality, a fundamental feature distinguishing quantum theory from classical models, is investigated via algebraic and topological structures inherent in modular tensor categories. This work rigorously demonstrates that braid group representations induced by modular categories, particularly those associated with SU(2) at level k and Fibonacci anyon models, exhibit state-dependent contextuality characterized by violations of noncontextuality inequalities. By explicitly constructing these unitary representations on fusion spaces, the study establishes a direct correspondence between braiding operations and logical contextuality scenarios. The results offer a comprehensive topological framework to classify and quantify contextuality in low-dimensional quantum systems, elucidating its role as a resource in topological quantum computation and advancing the interface between quantum algebra, topology, and quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Inflation in the Scale Symmetric Standard Model and Weyl geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the possibility of inflation in a scale-symmetric extension of the Standard Model Higgs sector, where the Higgs field $\phi_1$ is coupled to a singlet scalar, the dilaton $\phi_0$. The two-scalar theory is formulated within Weyl geometry, which modifies the Einstein frame form of the resulting single-field inflationary potential. We extend the analysis to include quantum corrections, incorporating curvature effects in the one-loop effective potential. We find that the resulting spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.002}$ can be consistent with the Planck 2018 observational constraints. The predicted value $r_{0.002} \lesssim 10^{-6}$ remains too small to yield a detectable gravitational wave signal. In the regime with a strong hierarchy between the non-minimal couplings, $\xi_1\ll\xi_0$, the unitarity cutoff in the large-field background, $\Lambda_{UV}\sim M_P/\sqrt{\xi_1}$, lies below the energy scales relevant during inflation.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

      <title>The dilaton gravity hologram of double-scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work out a precise holographic duality between sine dilaton gravity, and DSSYK. More precisely, canonical quantization of sine dilaton gravity reproduces q-Schwarzian quantum mechanics, which is the auxiliary system that arises from the chord diagrams of DSSYK. The role of the chord number in DSSYK is played by the (Weyl rescaled) geodesic length in the bulk. The most puzzling aspect of reconciling DSSYK with a simple gravitational dual at the classical level is the distinction between temperature and "fake temperature". At the q-Schwarzian level, we clarify how this arises from the constraint that the chord number is positive. The on-shell q-Schwarzian action with the constraint reproduces the thermodynamics of DSSYK. Semi-classically, in sine dilaton gravity this translates to the insertion of a defect, from which we deduce that fake temperature is the Hawking temperature of a smooth Lorentzian black hole. We comment on several relations with dS space. One remarkable feature is that in sine dilaton gravity quantization discretizes spacetime, therefore the Hilbert space is discrete.</description>

      <title>A topological contribution to Bogoliubov coefficient for cosmological particle production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle production in cosmology is often efficiently computed in terms of Bogoliubov transforms. Restricting to a particular class of dispersion relationships, we identify a map between the number of particles produced in a special kinematic limit and a Stokes phenomena related topology of analytic continuation of the Bogoliubov coefficient functions. Intuitively, this kinematic limit corresponds to the long wavelength limit although a more precise description depends on the nature of the curved spacetime. To identify the topology, we reformulate the usual Bogoliubov computations as a type of SU(1,1) gauged differential equation and utilize a special gauge together with a discrete symmetry that naturally characterizes the dispersion relationship. Using a dark matter model and a nonzero constant spatial curvature model, we estimate how such topological contributions will arise in physical applications.</description>

      <title>Renyi reflected entropy and entanglement wedge cross section with cosmic branes in AdS/BCFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the $m-1$ correction to the reflected entropy for two adjacent intervals on a half-infinite line within the AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ framework, where $m$ is a Renyi index for a canonical purification. We utilize the doubling trick and compute the leading terms in the large central charge expansion of correlation functions in the holographic BCFT. In the corresponding AdS space with an end of the world brane, we analyze the entanglement wedge cross section, the dual counterpart of reflected entropy. This AdS/BCFT setup allows us to explore a richer set of phases in the entanglement wedge cross section. The $m-1$ correction in the holographic BCFT manifests as modifications in the entanglement wedge cross section induced by cosmic branes. For the adjacent intervals anchored to the boundary of BCFT, we show the duality between the entanglement wedge cross section with the backreaction from a cosmic brane and Renyi reflected entropy at all orders in $m-1$. Furthermore, by analyzing the entanglement wedge cross section for general adjacent intervals, we provide guidance for an $\epsilon$-expansion of five-point functions in the holographic CFT, where $\epsilon$ is the rescaled conformal dimension by the central charge.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropy of gravitational fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The corrections to holographic entanglement entropy from bulk quantum fields in a classical gravitational background are now well understood. They lead, in particular, to unitary Page curves for evaporating black holes. However, the correct treatment of quantum fluctuations of the metric, including graviton excitations, is a longstanding problem. We provide a gauge-invariant prescription for the generalized entropy of gravitons in anti-de Sitter space in terms of areas and bulk entanglement entropy, generalizing the quantum extremal surface prescription to accommodate fluctuations in the semiclassical spacetime geometry. This task requires a careful treatment of the area operator on the graviton Hilbert space and the definition of a "quantum extremal gauge" in which the extremal surface is unperturbed. It also requires us to determine the correct vacuum modular Hamiltonian for the graviton field, which we fix by requiring that it doesn't contain a boundary term in extremal gauge. We check our prescription with an explicit computation of the vacuum-subtracted generalized entropy of states containing a graviton in an AdS-Rindler background. Our results exactly match vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropies for stress-tensor excited states in holographic conformal field theory with $d&gt;2$ dimensions. We also use covariant phase space techniques to give a partial proof of our prescription when the entanglement wedge for the background spacetime has a bifurcate Killing horizon. Along the way, we identify a class of perturbative graviton states that have parametrically larger generalized entropy, in the small $G_N$ expansion, than any low-energy excitations of an ordinary quantum field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modes with zero longitudinal light-front momentum (zero modes) do have roles to play in the analysis of light-front field theories. These range from improvements in convergence for numerical calculations to implications for the light-front vacuum and beyond to fundamental issues in the connection with equal-time quantization. In particular, the discrepancy in values of the critical coupling for $\phi^4_{1+1}$ theory, between equal-time and light-front quantizations, would appear to be resolvable with the proper treatment of zero modes and near-zero modes. We provide a survey of these issues and point to open questions.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Functional Determinants of Radial Operators via Heat Kernel Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient regularization method for functional determinants of radial operators using heat kernel coefficients. Our key finding is a systematic way to identify heat kernel coefficients in the angular momentum space. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernel expansion, which suffice to regularize functional determinants in up to 13 dimensions. We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate the large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants, and make numerical computations more efficient. In the limit of a large angular momentum, our formulas reduce to the WKB formulas in previous studies, but extended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta function regularization and the dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>Towards a Flat Space Carrollian Hologram from AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a concrete example holography in four dimensional asymptotically flat space is an important open problem. A natural strategy is to take the flat space limit of the celebrated AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ correspondence, which relates M-theory in AdS$_4 \times$S$^7$ to a certain superconformal Chern-Simons-matter theory known as the ABJM theory. In this limit, the boundary of AdS$_4$ becomes null infinity and the ABJM theory should exhibit an emergent superconformal Carrollian symmetry. We investigate this possiblity by matching the Carrollian limit of ABJM correlators with four-dimensional supergravity amplitudes that arise from taking the flat space limit of AdS$_4 \times$S$^7$ and reducing along the S$^7$. We also present a general analysis of three-dimensional superconformal Carrollian symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00405v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a topological structure: namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: It is known from Zhu's results that under modular transformations, correlators of rational $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebras transform like Jacobi forms. We investigate the modular transformation properties of VOA correlators that have zero modes inserted. We derive recursion relations for such correlators and use them to establish modular transformation properties. We find that correlators with only zero modes transform like quasi-modular forms, and mixed correlators with both zero modes and vertex operators transform like quasi-Jacobi forms. As an application of our results, we introduce algebras of higher weight fields whose zero mode correlators mimic the properties of those of weight 1 fields. We also give a simplified proof of the weight 1 transformation properties originally proven by Miyamoto.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the large-$N_c$ structure of the baryon-baryon potential derived in the framework of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order including contact interactions as well as one-meson and two-meson exchange diagrams. Moreover, we assess the impact of SU(3) symmetry breaking from a large-$N_c$ perspective and show that the leading order results can successfully be applied to the hyperon-nucleon potential. Our results include a reduction of the number of relevant low-energy constants of the leading order contact interaction from fifteen to three, and we show that consistency is preserved if the $F/D$ ratio is given by $2/3$ and the $C/D$ ratio for the baryon decuplet-to-octet coupling is given by 2.</description>

      <title>Rotating spacetimes with a free scalar field in four and five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit rotating solutions in Einstein's theory of relativity with a minimally coupled free scalar field rederiving and finding solutions in four or five spacetime dimensions. These spacetimes describe, in particular, the back-reaction of a free scalar field evolving in a Kerr spacetime. Adapting the general integrability result obtained many years ago from Eri\c{s}-G\"{u}rses to simpler spherical coordinates, we present a method for rederiving the four-dimensional Bogush-Gal'tsov solution. Furthermore, we find the five-dimensional spacetime featuring a free scalar with two distinct angular momenta. In the static limit, these five-dimensional geometries provide higher-dimensional extensions of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime. Last but not least, we obtain the four-dimensional version of a Kerr-Newman-NUT spacetime endowed with a free scalar, where the scalar field's radial profile is extended to incorporate dependence on the polar angular coordinate. Our results offer a comprehensive analysis of several recently proposed four-dimensional static solutions with scalar multipolar hair, representing a unified study of spacetimes with a free scalar field in both four and five dimensions under the general integrability result of Eri\c{s}-G\"{u}rses.</description>

Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of charged and accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconsider various C-metric spacetimes describing charged and (slowly) accelerating AdS black holes in different theories of (non-linear) electrodynamics and revisit their thermodynamic properties. Focusing first on the Maxwell theory, we find a parametrization of the metric where we can eliminate the non-trivial `normalization' of the boost Killing vector which was crucial for obtaining consistent thermodynamics in previous studies. We also calculate the Euclidean action using i) the standard holographic renormalization and ii) using the topological renormalization, showing that in the presence of overall cosmic string tension the two do not agree. These results are also extended to accelerating black holes in ModMax and RegMax non-linear electrodynamics. Interestingly, for the latter the electrostatic potential picks up a modification, that remains to be explained, but is consistent with the topological renormalization and the (generalized) Hawking--Ross prescription. Our study indicates that thermodynamics of charged accelerating black holes is far from being completely understood.</description>

      <title>Measuring Decoherence Due to Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations--which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter--can lead to observable irreversible decoherence if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <title>Bunch-Davies initial conditions and non-perturbative inflationary dynamics in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using numerical relativity. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies vaccuum and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model. When perturbations are small, we recover standard predictions of cosmological perturbation theory, and we quantify strongly non-linear inhomogeneities when non-perturbative configurations emerge, such as in the strong resonance model. Our results pave the way towards the first realistic non-perturbative, and fully non-linear Numerical Relativity simulations of the early inflationary universe.</description>

      <title>Models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study six-dimensional $SU(n)$ gauge models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on the orbifold $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$, without and with continuous Wilson line phases. For the latter case, we find that a minimal model can describe the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry based on an $SU(6)$ gauge group. This model possesses excellent features that two Higgs doublets come from the zero modes of the extra-dimensional gauge field, and the quarks in each generation can be unified into one multiplet, without exotic quarks, as the zero modes of a bulk field in the $\boldsymbol{15}$ representation of $SU(6)$. There exists a vacuum where the electroweak symmetry is slightly broken by the Hosotani mechanism, with the addition of suitable bulk fields. %adding suitable bulk fields, and Interestingly, quadratic divergences are not reintroduced into the Higgs masses from the tadpole terms of the field strength localized on fixed points, not only at one-loop level but also at higher orders.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity, in which the effective gravitational constant is parametrized as $G(\epsilon) = G_{N} /[1 + \tilde{\omega} (G_{N}^{2} \epsilon)^{\alpha}]$, where $G_{N}$ and $\epsilon$ denote Newton's gravitational constant and the energy density of the matter field, respectively, with two dimensionless model parameters, $\tilde{\omega}$ and $\alpha$. Within this framework, we investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid and find that singularity is completely resolved for $\alpha &gt; 1$ but not for $1/2 \le \alpha \le 1$. The case of $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$ is inconsistent with asymptotic safety. Moreover, we note that although the singularity cannot be fully resolved for $\alpha = 1$, it is significantly weakened by quantum gravity effects. Furthermore, we successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes in an asymptotically flat spacetime. The resulting regular black hole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric fully expressible in terms of the Lerch transcendent for general cases and in elementary functions for certain values of $\alpha$, including $\alpha = 2$. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black holes.</description>

      <title>General Einstein-Cartan quadratic gravity with derivative couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity we consider an action, containing up to quadratic terms of the Ricci scalar and the Holst invariant, coupled non-minimally to a scalar field, including couplings of its derivatives to curvature. We derive the equivalent metric theory, featuring an extra dynamical pseudoscalar degree of freedom associated with the presence of the Holst term in the action. We study the evolution of the resulting two-field system in a FRW background and show that it evolves rapidly into an effective single-field inflationary model. We find that the model is consistent with the latest observational data for a wide range of its parameters, determining the necessary upper limits on derivative coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an axionlike inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard interaction $\phi G \tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to rigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters compatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI.</description>

      <title>Dictionary revision for mapping boundary data to bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between gravitational observables derived from scattering processes and adiabatic invariants in bound orbits, within the framework of the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, has garnered significant attention in the study of bound orbital systems. However, the existing dictionary for this correspondence, \textcolor{black}{characterized by the transformation $\beta\rightarrow i \beta$ and $b\rightarrow \pm i |b|$ with $\beta=arccosh \gamma$}, produces complex-valued quantities of bound orbits in 4PM calculations. These results contradict fundamental physical principles, thereby highlighting deficiencies in the existing dictionary. Our research identifies a critical issue: the Fourier transform of the scattering amplitude incorporates a factor of $(p_\infty^2)^{-n/2}$. This factor introduces singularities at $p_\infty^2 = 0$, thereby rendering the original dictionary become ineffective, as it assumes the possibility of connecting both scattering states and bound states at the singular point. We propose a rigorous modification by employing Hawking's method for black hole radiation, specifically analytical continuing $p_\infty^2 \rightarrow p_\infty^2 e^{-i \pi}$. We also evaluate the new dictionary by comparing the binding energy calculated using effective one-body theory with numerical relativity simulation data from the SXS collaboration. Our findings indicate a remarkable agreement between the two sets of results. This revised dictionary enhances the applicability of gravitational observables derived from scattering processes to bound orbits and effectively fulfills the objectives envisioned by the pioneers who proposed this correspondence.</description>

      <title>Imprint of $\alpha$-clustering on nucleon-nucleon correlations in relativistic light ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of $\alpha$-cluster structures in relativistic light nuclear collisions. Using a cluster framework, the characteristics of the nucleonic configurations of $^{16}$ O and $^{20}$ Ne are extracted as predicted by various \textit{ab initio} models, including Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT), Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM). Additionally, I analyze configurations derived from a three-parameter Fermi (3pF) density function. The investigation focuses on the effects of cluster parameters on two-point correlators using a rotor model for symmetric collisions ($^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne) and asymmetric collisions ($^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O and $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne). The cluster parameters are determined by minimizing the \textit{chi-square} statistic to align the nucleon distributions with those predicted by the mentioned theories. The results reveal that perturbative calculations effectively capture the structural features of these nuclei, while comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations validate these findings. Furthermore, The analysis reveals distinct cluster geometries: VMC suggests tetrahedral shapes, while NLEFT, PGCM, and 3pF indicate irregular triangular pyramids. Notably, NLEFT shows a bowling pin-like $\alpha$ cluster structure for $^{20}$Ne. The study also identifies constraints on cluster parameters in the ground and excited oxygen states, with a gradual increase in $\varepsilon_2\{2\}$ for excited states. Accurate modeling of asymmetric collisions requires a range of nucleons from heavy spherical nuclei, leading to weighted correlators in perturbative calculations. I demonstrate consistency between perturbative calculations and Monte Carlo models, with analytical calculations providing more insights into asymmetric than symmetric collisions.</description>
