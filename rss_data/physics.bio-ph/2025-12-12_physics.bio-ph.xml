      <title>Corkscrew motion of Trypanosome brucei is driven by helical beating of the flagellum and facilitated by its bent shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, a laterally attached flagellum drives rapid deformation of the complex cell body, producing puzzling dynamics. High-speed defocusing imaging reveals that surface points trace flower-like patterns in transverse planes. The petals arise from clockwise flagellar beating, which generates a right-handed helical wave propagating from the anterior tip along the body, advancing the cell like a twisted corkscrew. The central lobes result from slower counterclockwise body rotation required to balance the active torque. The bent cell shape underneath the flagellum superimposes these two chiral motions at different radial distances, producing the observed patterns. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the method of regularized Stokeslets reproduce these dynamics and show that bent cell shape enhances swimming, suggesting an adaptive advantage of T. brucei's morphology.</description>

      <title>Unifying Theories in High-Dimensional Biology: Approaches, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across biological subdisciplines, the last decade has seen an explosion of high-dimensional datasets, including datasets for cells, species, immune systems, neurons and behaviour. At the ICTS workshop 'Unifying Theories in High-Dimensional Biophysics' we discussed whether this high dimensionality poses a challenge or opportunity for describing, understanding and predicting biological systems theoretically. We discussed methods, models and frameworks that can help with addressing empirical observations based on these high-dimensional datasets. We summarize the challenges and opportunities that emerged in discussions according to individual participants below.</description>

      <title>Motifs in self-organising cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex systems, groups of interacting objects may form prevalent and persistent spatiotemporal patterns, which we refer to as motifs. These motifs can exhibit features that reveal how individual objects interact with one another. Simultaneously, the motifs can also interact, causing new coarse-grained properties to emerge in the system.
  In this paper, we found motifs in a simulated system of Dynamically Self-Organising cells. We also found that quantifying these motifs with a set of physically interpretable structural and dynamic features efficiently captures the interaction dynamics of the motifs' underlying cells. Using these motif features, we revealed packing strain and defects in large compact aggregates, semi-periodicity in motif ensembles, and phase space classes with unsupervised machine learning. Additionally, we trained neural networks to infer the critical hidden microscopic interaction parameters within each motif from coarse-grained motif features extracted from snapshots of the system. Furthermore, we uncovered emergent features that can predict the movement of cell collectives by hierarchically coarse-graining smaller motifs into larger ones (e.g. motif clusters). We speculate that this concept of motif hierarchies may be applied broadly to many-body interacting systems that are otherwise too complex to understand.</description>

      <title>Motor shot noise explains active fluctuations in a single cilium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscopic fluctuations reveal stochastic dynamics of molecules in both inanimate and living matter. We investigate how small-number fluctuations shape the collective dynamics of molecular motors using motile cilia as model system. We theoretically show that fluctuations in the number of bound motors are sufficient to explain experimentally observed fluctuations, including correlation length and ``phase slips'' of intra-cilium synchronization. Our findings constrain theories of motor control and establish a link between microscopic motor noise and mesoscopic non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum relaxometry for detecting biomolecular interactions with single NV centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has emerged as a pivotal research area in life science, particularly through optical, mechanical, and electrochemical approaches. Spins existing widely in biological systems, offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving $\sim$10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we re-examined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule Scale Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using a Robust Near-Infrared Spin Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the single-molecule level with atomic resolution holds transformative potential for structural biology and surface chemistry. Near-surface solid-state spin sensors with optical readout ability offer a promising pathway toward this goal. However, their extreme proximity to target molecules demands exceptional robustness against surface-induced perturbations. Furthermore, life science applications require these sensors to operate in biocompatible spectral ranges that minimize photodamage. In this work, we demonstrate that the PL6 quantum defect in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) can serve as a robust near-infrared spin sensor. This sensor operates at tissue-transparent wavelengths and exhibits exceptional near-surface stability even at depth of 2 nm. Using shallow PL6 centers, we achieve nanoscale NMR detection of proton ($\mathrm{^{1}H}$) spins in immersion oil and fluorine ($\mathrm{^{19}F}$) spins in Fomblin, attaining a detection volume of $\mathrm{(3~nm)^3}$ and a sensitivity reaching the requirement for single-proton spin detection. This work establishes 4H-SiC quantum sensors as a compelling platform for nanoscale magnetic resonance, with promising applications in probing low-dimensional water phases, protein folding dynamics, and molecular interactions.</description>

      <title>Tracking large chemical reaction networks and rare events by neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks are widely used to model stochastic dynamics in chemical kinetics, systems biology and epidemiology. Solving the chemical master equation that governs these systems poses a significant challenge due to the large state space exponentially growing with system sizes. The development of autoregressive neural networks offers a flexible framework for this problem; however, its efficiency is limited especially for high-dimensional systems and in scenarios with rare events. Here, we push the frontier of neural-network approach by exploiting faster optimizations such as natural gradient descent and time-dependent variational principle, achieving a 5- to 22-fold speedup, and by leveraging enhanced-sampling strategies to capture rare events. We demonstrate reduced computational cost and higher accuracy over the previous neural-network method in challenging reaction networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade network, the hitherto largest biological network handled by the previous approaches of solving the chemical master equation. We further apply the approach to spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems, the Schl\"ogl model with rare events, on two-dimensional lattices, beyond the recent tensor-network approach that handles one-dimensional lattices. The present approach thus enables efficient modeling of chemical reaction networks in general.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Spatial Clustering of Single-Molecule Localizations with Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy generates point clouds corresponding to fluorophore localizations. Spatial cluster identification and analysis of these point clouds are crucial for extracting insights about molecular organization. However, this task becomes challenging in the presence of localization noise, high point density, or complex biological structures. Here, we introduce MIRO (Multifunctional Integration through Relational Optimization), an algorithm that uses recurrent graph neural networks to transform the point clouds in order to improve clustering efficiency when applying conventional clustering techniques. We show that MIRO supports simultaneous processing of clusters of different shapes and at multiple scales, demonstrating improved performance across varied datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MIRO's transformative potential for single-molecule localization applications, showcasing its capability to revolutionize cluster analysis and provide accurate, reliable details of molecular architecture. In addition, MIRO's robust clustering capabilities hold promise for applications in various fields such as neuroscience, for the analysis of neural connectivity patterns, and environmental science, for studying spatial distributions of ecological data.</description>

      <title>Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a systematic characterization of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks within the quenched mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Practical protein-pocket hydration-site prediction for drug discovery on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating the practical utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware for recurrent tasks in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery is of paramount importance. We tackle this challenge by performing three-dimensional protein pockets hydration-site prediction on a quantum computer. Formulating the water placement problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), we use a hybrid approach coupling a classical three-dimensional reference-interaction site model (3D-RISM) to an efficient quantum optimization solver, to run various hardware experiments up to 123 qubits. Matching the precision of classical approaches, our results reproduced experimental predictions on real-life protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, through a detailed resource estimation analysis, we show that accuracy can be systematically improved with increasing number of qubits, indicating that full quantum utility is in reach. Finally, we provide evidence that advantageous situations could be found for systems where classical optimization struggles to provide optimal solutions. The method has potential for assisting simulations of protein-ligand complexes for drug lead optimization and setup of docking calculations.</description>

Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08684, arXiv:2512.09421, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce pertinent composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works arXiv:2512.09421, arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08682.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning three-factor plasticity rules for structured credit assignment with sparse feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>
