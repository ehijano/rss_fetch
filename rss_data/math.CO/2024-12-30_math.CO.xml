      <title>Total restrained coalitions in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $S\subseteq V$ in an isolate-free graph $G$ is a total restrained dominating set, abbreviated TRD-set, if every vertex in $V$ is adjacent to a vertex in $S$, and every vertex in $V\setminus S$ is adjacent to a vertex in $V\setminus S$. A total restrained coalition is made up of two disjoint sets of vertices $X$ and $Y$ of $G$, neither of which is a TRD-set but their union $X\cup Y$ is a TRD-set. A total restrained coalition partition of a graph $G$ is a partition $\Phi=\{V_1, V_2,\dots,V_k\}$ such that for all $i \in [k]$, the set $V_i$ forms a total restrained coalition with another set $V_j$ for some $j$, where $j\in [k]\setminus{i}$. The total restrained coalition number $C_{tr}(G)$ in $G$ equals the maximum order of a total restrained coalition partition in $G$. In this work, we initiate the study of total restrained coalition in graphs and its properties.</description>

      <title>A Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} theory for partial orders of a fixed finite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $n\geq 2$, we show that the class of all finite $n$-dimensional partial orders, when expanded with $n$ linear orders which realize the partial order, forms a Fra\"iss\'e class and identify its Fra\"iss\'e limit $(D_n,&lt;,&lt;_1,\ldots,&lt;_n)$. We give a finite axiomatization of this limit which specifies it uniquely up to isomorphism among countable structures. We then show that the aforementioned class of finite structures satisfies the Ramsey property and conclude, by the Kechris-Pestov-Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} correspondence, that the automorphism group of its Fra\"iss\'e limit is extremely amenable. Finally, we identify the universal minimal flow of the automorphism group of the reduct $(D_n,&lt;)$.</description>

      <title>Chain Conditions and Optimal Elements in Generalized Union-Closed Families of Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The union-closed sets conjecture (sometimes referred to as Frankl's conjecture) states that every finite, nontrivial union-closed family of sets has an element that is in at least half of its members. Although the conjecture is known to be false in the infinite setting, we show that many interesting results can still be recovered by imposing suitable chain conditions and considering carefully chosen elements called optimal elements. We use these elements to show that the union-closed conjecture holds for both finite and infinite union-closed families such that the cardinality of any chain of sets is at most three. We also show that the conjecture holds for all nontrivial topological spaces satisfying the descending chain condition on its open sets. Notably, none of those arguments depend on the cardinality of the underlying family or its universe. Finally, we provide an interesting class of families that satisfy the conclusion of the conjecture but are not necessarily union-closed.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart Polynomials of Order Polytopes: Interpreting Combinatorial Sequences on the OEIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an overview of Ehrhart polynomials associated with order polytopes of finite posets, a concept first introduced by Stanley. We focus on their combinatorial interpretations for many sequences listed on the OEIS. We begin by exploring the Ehrhart series of order polytopes resulting from various poset operations, specifically the ordinal sum and direct sum. We then concentrate on the poset $P_\lambda$ associated with the Ferrers diagram of a partition $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_t)$. When $\lambda = (k, k-1, \ldots, 1)$, the Ehrhart polynomial is a shifted Hankel determinant of the well-known Catalan numbers; when $\lambda = (k, k, \ldots, k)$, the Ehrhart polynomial is solved by Stanley's hook content formula and is used to prove conjectures for the sequence [A140934] on the OEIS. When solving these problems, we rediscover Kreweras' determinant formula for the Ehrhart polynomial $\mathrm{ehr}(\mathcal{O}(P_{\lambda}), n)$ through the application of the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot lemma on non-intersecting lattice paths.</description>

      <title>Arc-transitive maps with edge number coprime to the Euler characteristic -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is one of a series of papers which aim towards a classification of edge-transitive maps of which the Euler characteristic and the edge number are coprime. This one establishes a framework and carries out the classification work for arc-transitive maps with solvable automorphism groups, which illustrates how the edge number impacts on the Euler characteristic for maps. The classification is involved with the constructions of various new and interesting arc-regular maps.</description>

      <title>Exploring Graphs with Distinct $M$-Eigenvalues: Product Operation, Wronskian Vertices, and Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}^M$ denote the set of connected graphs with distinct $M$-eigenvalues. This paper explores the $M$-spectrum and eigenvectors of a new product $G\circ_C H$ of graphs $G$ and $H$. We present the necessary and sufficient condition for $G\circ_C H$ to have distinct $M$-eigenvalues. Specifically, for the rooted product $G\circ H$, we present a more concise and precise condition. A key concept, the $M$-Wronskian vertex, which plays a crucial role in determining graph properties related to separability and construction of specific graph families, is investigated. We propose a novel method for constructing infinite pairs of non-isomorphic $M$-cospectral graphs in $\mathcal{G}^M$ by leveraging the structural properties of the $M$-Wronskian vertex. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient condition for $G\circ H$ to be $M$-controllable is given.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tur\'an problems for a matching and long cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph $G$ is $\mathscr{F}$-free if $G$ does not contain any $F\in \mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. The general Tur\'an number, denoted by $ex(n, H,\mathscr{F})$, is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathscr{F}$-free graph. Then $ex(n, K_2,\mathscr{F})$, also denote by $ex(n, \mathscr{F})$, is the Tur\'an number. Recently, Alon and Frankl determined the exact value of $ex(n, \{K_{k},M_{s+1}\})$, where $K_{k}$ and $M_{s+1}$ are a complete graph on $k $ vertices and a matching of size $s +1$, respectively. Then many results were obtained by extending $K_{k}$ to a general fixed graph or family of graphs. Let $C_k$ be a cycle of order $k$. Denote $C_{\ge k}=\{C_k,C_{k+1},\ldots\}$. In this paper, we determine the value of $ex(n,K_r, \{C_{\ge k},M_{s+1}\})$ for large enough $n$ and obtain the extremal graphs when $k$ is odd. Particularly, the exact value of $ex(n, \{C_{\ge k},M_{s+1}\})$ and the extremal graph are given for large enough $n$.</description>

      <title>The Minimum Weighting Ratio Problem and Its Application in Chordal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing the maximum spanning tree $T$ of an edge-weighted connected graph $G$ is one of the important research topics in computer science and optimization, and the related research results have played an active role in practical applications. In this paper, we are concerned with the ratio of the weighted sum of a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ to the weighted sum of $G$, which we try to minimize. We propose an interesting theorem to simplify this problem and show that this optimal problem can be solved in polynomial time. Furthermore, we apply the optimal problem in chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>On $\ell$-distance-balancedness of cubic Cayley graphs of dihedral groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph $\Gamma$ of diameter ${\rm diam}(\Gamma) \ge \ell$ is $\ell$-distance-balanced if $|W_{xy}(\Gamma)|=|W_{yx}(\Gamma)|$ for every $x,y\in V(\Gamma)$ with $d_{\Gamma}(x,y)=\ell$, where $W_{xy}(\Gamma)$ is the set of vertices of $\Gamma$ that are closer to $x$ than to $y$. $\Gamma$ is said to be highly distance-balanced if it is $\ell$-distance-balanced for every $\ell\in [{\rm diam}(\Gamma)]$. It is proved that every cubic Cayley graph whose generating set is one of $\{a,a^{n-1},ba^r\}$ and $\{a^k,a^{n-k},ba^t\}$ is highly distance-balanced. This partially solves a problem posed by Miklavi\v{c} and \v{S}parl.</description>

      <title>On some Grothendieck expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete flag variety admits a natural action by both the orthogonal group and the symplectic group. Wyser and Yong defined orthogonal Grothendieck polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ and symplectic Grothendieck polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{Sp}}_z$ as the $K$-theory classes of the corresponding orbit closures. There is an explicit formula to expand $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{Sp}}_z$ as a nonnegative sum of Grothendieck polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{(\beta)}_w$, which represent the $K$-theory classes of Schubert varieties. Although the constructions of $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{Sp}}_z$ and $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ are similar, finding the $\mathfrak{G}^{(\beta)}$-expansion of $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ or even computing $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ is much harder. If $z$ is vexillary then $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ has a nonnegative $\mathfrak{G}^{(\beta)}$-expansion, but the associated coefficients are mostly unknown. This paper derives several new formulas for $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ and its $\mathfrak{G}^{(\beta)}$-expansion when $z$ is vexillary. Among other applications, we prove that the latter expansion has a nontrivial stability property.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of Hom complexes of graph homomorphisms whose codomains are square-free</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given finite simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is a polyhedral complex having the graph homomorphisms $G\to H$ as the vertices. We determine the homotopy type of each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ when $H$ is square-free, meaning that it does not contain the $4$-cycle graph $C_4$ as a subgraph. Specifically, for a connected $G$ and a square-free $H$, we show that each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of circles. We further show that, given any graph homomorphism $f\colon G\to H$ to a square-free $H$, one can determine the homotopy type of the connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ containing $f$ algorithmically.</description>

      <title>On off-diagonal $F$-Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is $(t_1, t_2)$-Ramsey if any red-blue coloring of its edges contains either a red copy of $K_{t_1}$ or a blue copy of $K_{t_2}$. The size Ramsey number is the minimum number of edges contained in a $(t_1,t_2)$-Ramsey graph. Generalizing the notion of size Ramsey numbers, the $F$-Ramsey number $r_F(t_1, t_2)$ is defined to be the minimum number of copies of $F$ in a $(t_1,t_2)$-Ramsey graph. It is easy to see that $r_{K_s}(t_1,t_2)\le \binom{r(t_1,t_2)}{s}$. Recently, Fox, Tidor, and Zhang showed that equality holds in this bound when $s=3$ and $t_1=t_2$, i.e. $r_{K_3}(t,t) = \binom{r(t,t)}{3}$. They further conjectured that $r_{K_s}(t,t)=\binom{r(t,t)}{s}$ for all $s\le t$, in response to a question of Spiro.
  In this work, we study the off-diagonal variant of this conjecture: is it true that $r_{K_s}(t_1,t_2)=\binom{r(t_1,t_2)}{s}$ whenever $s\le \max(t_1,t_2)$? Harnessing the constructions used in the recent breakthrough work of Mattheus and Verstra\"ete on the asymptotics of $r(4,t)$, we show that when $t_1$ is $3$ or $4$, the above equality holds up to a lower order term in the exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of DP-coloring of graphs was introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle, and was used to prove that planar graphs without cycles of length from $4$ to $8$ are $3$-choosable. In the same paper, they proposed a more natural and stronger claim that such graphs are DP-$3$-colorable. This paper confirms that claim by proving a stronger result that planar graphs having no cycle of length $4$, $6$ or $8$ are DP-3-colorable.</description>

      <title>The matching extendability of optimal $1$-embedded graphs on the projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss matching extendability of optimal $1$-projective plane graphs (abbreviated as O1PPG), which are drawn on the projective plane $P^2$ so that every edge crosses another edge at most once, and has $n$ vertices and exactly $4n- 4$ edges. We first show that every O1PPG of even order is $1$-extendable. Next, we characterize $2$-extendable O1PPG's in terms of a separating cycle consisting of only non-crossing edges. Moreover, we characterize O1PPG's having connectivity exactly $5$. Using the characterization, we further identify three independent edges in those graphs that are not extendable.</description>

      <title>On Laplacian and Distance Laplacian Spectra of Generalized Fan Graph &amp; a New Graph Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the Laplacian matrix of $G$, $L(G)$ is the difference of the adjacency matrix $A(G)$ and $\text{Deg}(G)$, where $\text{Deg}(G)$ is the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees.
  The distance Laplacian matrix $D^L({G})$ is the difference of the transmission matrix of $G$ and the distance matrix of $G$.
  In the given paper, we first obtain the Laplacian and distance Laplacian spectrum of generalized fan graphs.
  We then introduce a new graph class which is denoted by $\mathcal{NC}(F_{m,n})$. Finally, we determine the Laplacian spectrum and the distance Laplacian spectrum of $\mathcal{NC}(F_{m,n})$.</description>

      <title>Hom complexes of graphs whose codomains are square-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ of graphs is a simplicial complex associated to a pair of graphs $G$ and $H$, and its homotopy type is of interest in the graph coloring problem and the homomorphism reconfiguration problem. Recently, Soichiro Fujii, Yuni Iwamasa, Kei Kimura, Yuta Nozaki and Akira Suzuki showed that if $G$ is connected and $H$ is a cycle graph then every connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ is contractible or homotopy equivalent to a circle. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a connected graph and $H$ is a square-free connected graph, then every connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a point, a circle, $H$ or a connected double cover over $H$. We also obtain a certain relation between the fundamental group of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ and realizable walks studied in the homomorphism reconfiguration problem.</description>

      <title>Connected triangle-free planar graphs whose second largest eigenvalue is at most 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda_2$ be the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a connected graph. In 2023, Li and Sun \cite{LiSun1} determined all the connected $\{K_{2,3}, K_4\}$-minor free graphs whose second largest eigenvalue $\lambda_2\le 1$. As a continuance of it, in this paper we completely identify all the connected $\{K_5,K_{3,3}\}$-minor free graphs without $C_3$ whose second largest eigenvalue does not exceed 1. This partially solves an open problem posed by Li and Sun \cite{LiSun1}: Characterize all connected planar graphs whose second largest eigenvalue is at most $1.$ Our main tools include the spectral theory and the local structure characterization of the planar graph with respect to its girth.</description>

      <title>Semistrong edge colorings of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strengthened notions of a matching $M$ of a graph $G$ have been considered, requiring that the matching $M$ has some properties with respect to the subgraph $G_M$ of $G$ induced by the vertices covered by $M$: If $M$ is the unique perfect matching of $G_M$, then $M$ is a uniquely restricted matching of $G$; if all the edges of $M$ are pendant edges of $G_M$, then $M$ is a semistrong matching of $G$; if all the vertices of $G_M$ are pendant, then $M$ is an induced matching of $G$. Strengthened notions of edge coloring and of the chromatic index follow.
  In this paper, we consider the maximum semistrong chromatic index of planar graphs with given maximum degree $\Delta$. We prove that graphs with maximum average degree less than ${14}/{5}$ have semistrong chromatic index (hence uniquely restricted chromatic index) at most $2\Delta+4$, and we reduce the bound to $2\Delta+2$ if the maximum average degree is less than ${8}/{3}$. These cases cover, in particular, the cases of planar graphs with girth at least 7 (resp. at least 8).
  Our result makes some progress on the conjecture of Lu\v{z}ar, Mockov\v{c}iakov\'a and Sot\'ak [J. Graph Theory 105 (2024) 612--632], which asserts that every planar graph $G$ has a semistrong edge coloring with $2\Delta+C$ colors, for some universal constant $C$. (Note that such a conjecture would fail for strong edge coloring as there exist graphs with arbitrarily large maximum degree that are not strongly $(4\Delta-5)$-edge-colorable.)
  We conjecture that the upper bound for both the uniquely restricted chromatic index and the semistrong chromatic index of planar graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $2\Delta+4$, and provide an example of a planar graph achieving this bound.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Structural Results for the Hull and Convexity Numbers in Cycle Convexity for Graph Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $S \subseteq V(G)$. In the cycle convexity, we say that $S$ is \textit{cycle convex} if for any $u\in V(G)\setminus S$, the induced subgraph of $S\cup\{u\}$ contains no cycle that includes $u$. The \textit{cycle convex hull} of $S$ is the smallest convex set containing $S$. The \textit{cycle hull number} of $G$, denoted by $hn_{cc}(G)$, is the cardinality of the smallest set $S$ such that the convex hull of $S$ is $V(G)$. The \textit{convexity number} of $G$, denoted by $C_{cc}(G)$, is the maximum cardinality of a proper convex set of $V(G)$. This paper studies cycle convexity in graph products. We show that the cycle hull number is always two for strong and lexicographic products. For the Cartesian, we establish tight bounds for this product and provide a closed formula when the factors are trees, generalizing an existing result for grid graphs. In addition, given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, we prove that $hn_{cc}(G) \leq k$ is NP-complete even if $G$ is a bipartite Cartesian product graph, addressing an open question in the literature. Furthermore, we present exact formulas for the cycle convexity number in those three graph products. That leads to the NP-completeness of, given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, deciding whether $C_{cc}(G) \geq k$, when $G$ is a Cartesian, strong or lexicographic product graph.</description>

      <title>On tight tree-complete hypergraph Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chv\'atal showed that for any tree $T$ with $k$ edges the Ramsey number $R(T,n)=k(n-1)+1$ ("Tree-complete graph Ramsey numbers." Journal of Graph Theory 1.1 (1977): 93-93). For $r=3$ or $4$, we show that, if $T$ is an $r$-uniform non-trivial tight tree, then the hypergraph Ramsey number $R(T,n)=\Theta(n^{r-1})$. The 3-uniform result comes from observing a construction of Cooper and Mubayi. The main contribution of this paper is the 4-uniform construction, which is inspired by the Cooper-Mubayi 3-uniform construction.</description>

      <title>A tensor's spectral bound on the clique number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral radius of the clique tensor A(G) associated with a graph G. This tensor is a higher-order extensions of the adjacency matrix of G. A lower bound of the clique number is given via the spectral radius of A(G). It is an extension of Nikiforov's spectral bound and tighter than the bound of Nikiforov in some classes of graphs. Furthermore, we obtain a spectral version of the Erdos-Simonovits stability theorem for clique tensors based on this bound.</description>

      <title>A polynomial bosonic form of statistical configuration sums and the odd/even minimal excludant in integer partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the study of the minimal excludant in integer partitions by G.E. Andrews and D. Newman, we introduce a pair of new partition statistics, squrank and recrank. It is related to a polynomial bosonic form of statistical configuration sums for an integrable cellular automaton. For all nonnegative integer $n$, we prove that the partitions of $n$ on which squrank or recrank takes on a particular value, say $r$, are equinumerous with the partitions of $n$ on which the odd/even minimal exclutant takes on the corresponding value, $2r+1$ or $2r+2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean combinations allow combining given combinatorial objects to obtain new, potentially more complicated, objects. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of this idea applied to graphs. In order to understand expressive power and limitations of boolean combinations in this context, we investigate how they affect different combinatorial and structural properties of graphs, in particular $\chi$-boundedness, as well as characterize the structure of boolean combinations of graphs from various classes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing Conjecture of S. Negami states that a connected graph has a finite planar cover if and only if it embeds in the projective plane. It is known that the Conjecture is equivalent to the fact that \emph{the graph $K_{1,2, 2, 2}$ has no finite planar cover}. We prove three theorems showing that the graph $K_{1,2, 2, 2}$ admits no planar cover with certain structural properties, and that the minimal planar cover of $K_{1,2, 2, 2}$ (if it exists) must be $4$-connected.</description>

Specifically, we quantify precisely the proportion of $I$-graphs that are generalised Petersen graphs as well as those that are connected.

      <title>Sharp Bounds on Lengths of Linear Recolouring Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recolouring sequence, between $k$-colourings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of a graph $G$, transforms $\alpha$ into $\beta$ by recolouring one vertex at a time, such that after each recolouring step we again have a proper $k$-colouring of $G$. The diameter of the $k$-recolouring graph, $\textrm{diam}~\mathcal{C}_k(G)$, is the maximum over all pairs $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the minimum length of a recolouring sequence from $\alpha$ to $\beta$. Much previous work has focused on determining the asymptotics of $\textrm{diam}~\mathcal{C}_k(G)$: Is it $\Theta(|G|)$? Is it $\Theta(|G|^2)$? Or even larger? Here we focus on graphs for which $\textrm{diam}~\mathcal{C}_k(G)=\Theta(|G|)$, and seek to determine more precisely the multiplicative constant implicit in the $\Theta()$. In particular, for each $k\ge 3$, for all positive integers $p$ and $q$ we exactly determine $\textrm{diam}~\mathcal{C}_k(K_{p,q})$, up to a small additive constant. We also sharpen a recolouring lemma that has been used in multiple papers, proving an optimal version. This improves the multiplicative constant in various prior results. Finally, we investigate plausible relationships between similar reconfiguration graphs.</description>

Abstract: The functionality of a graph $G$ is the minimum number $k$ such that in every induced subgraph of $G$ there exists a vertex whose neighbourhood is uniquely determined by the neighborhoods of at most $k$ other vertices in the subgraph. The functionality parameter was introduced in the context of adjacency labeling schemes, and it generalises a number of classical and recent graph parameters including degeneracy, twin-width, and symmetric difference. We establish the functionality of a random graph $G(n,p)$ up to a constant factor for every value of $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several generalizations of Vershik-Kerov limit shape problem are motivated by topological string theory and supersymmetric gauge theory instanton count. In this paper specifically we study the circular and linear quiver theories. We also briefly discuss the double-elliptic generalization of the Vershik-Kerov problem, related to six dimensional gauge theory compactified on a torus, and to elliptic cohomology of the Hilbert scheme of points on a plane. We prove that the limit shape in that setting is governed by a genus two algebraic curve, suggesting unexpected dualities between the enumerative and equivariant parameters.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of Overpartitions into Nonmultiples of Two Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider properties of overpartitions that are simultaneously {\ell}-regular and {\mu}-regular, where {\ell} and {\mu} are positive relatively prime integers. We prove a seven-way combinatorial identity related to these overpartitions. We also prove several congruence properties satisfied by this class of partitions (and a further related class) using both generating functions and modular forms with Radu's Algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorics of dimer models on brane tilings describe a large class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories that afford quiver descriptions and have toric moduli spaces. We introduce a combinatorial optimization method leveraging simulated annealing to explicitly construct geometrically consistent brane tilings, providing a proof of concept for efficient generation of gauge theories using metaheuristic techniques. The implementation of this idea recovers known examples and allows us to derive a new brane tiling with $26$ quantum fields, whose construction is beyond the computational power of current methods.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics of inhomogeneous random graphs with graphon limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish central limit theorems (CLTs) for the linear spectral statistics of the adjacency matrix of inhomogeneous random graphs across all sparsity regimes, providing explicit covariance formulas under the assumption that the variance profile of the random graphs converges to a graphon limit. Two types of CLTs are derived for the (non-centered) adjacency matrix and the centered adjacency matrix, with different scaling factors when the sparsity parameter $p$ satisfies $np = n^{\Omega(1)}$, and with the same scaling factor when $np = n^{o(1)}$. In both cases, the limiting covariance is expressed in terms of homomorphism densities from certain types of finite graphs to a graphon. These results highlight a phase transition in the centering effect for global eigenvalue fluctuations. For the non-centered adjacency matrix, we also identify new phase transitions for the CLTs in the sparse regime when $n^{1/m} \ll np \ll n^{1/(m-1)}$ for $m \geq 2$. Furthermore, weaker conditions for the graphon convergence of the variance profile are sufficient as $p$ decreases from being constant to $np \to c\in (0,\infty)$. These findings reveal a novel connection between graphon limits and linear spectral statistics in random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Conjugation, loop and closure invariants of the iterated-integrals signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a feature set for the shape of a closed loop, it is natural to ask which features in that set do not change when the starting point of the path is moved. For example, in two dimensions, the area enclosed by the path does not depend on the starting point. In the present article, we characterize such loop invariants among all those features known as interated integrals of a given path. Furthermore, we relate these to conjugation invariants, which are a canonical object of study when treating (tree reduced) paths as a group with multiplication given by the concatenation. Finally, closure invariants are a third class in this context which is of particular relevance when studying piecewise linear trajectories, e.g. given by linear interpolation of time series.
  Keywords: invariant features; concatenation of paths; combinatorial necklaces; shuffle algebra; free Lie algebra; signed area; signed volume; tree-like equivalence.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <title>Robertson's conjecture I. Well-quasi-ordering bounded tree-width graphs by the topological minor relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.00192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robertson and Seymour's celebrated Graph Minor Theorem states that graphs are well-quasi-ordered by the minor relation. Unlike the minor relation, the topological minor relation does not well-quasi-order graphs in general. Among all known infinite antichains with respect to the topological containment, subdivisions of a graph obtained from an arbitrarily long path by duplicating each edge can be found. In the 1980's Robertson conjectured that this is the only obstruction. Formally, he conjectured that for every positive integer $k$, graphs that do not contain the graph obtained from a path of length $k$ by duplicating each edge as a topological minor are well-quasi-ordered by the topological minor relation. The case $k=1$ implies Kruskal's Tree Theorem, and the case $k=2$ implies a conjecture of V\'{a}zsonyi on subcubic graphs.
  This series of papers dedicates a proof of Robertson's conjecture. We prove Robertson's conjecture for graphs of bounded tree-width in this paper. It is an essential step toward the complete proof of Robertson's conjecture, and the machinery developed in this paper will be applied in future papers of the series. This bounded tree-width case proved in this paper implies all known results about well-quasi-ordering graphs by the topological minor relation that can be proved without using the Graph Minor Theorem, and our proof in this paper is self-contained.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there exists a function $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that every directed graph $G$ contains either $k$ directed odd cycles where every vertex of $G$ is contained in at most two of them, or a set of at most $f(k)$ vertices meeting all directed odd cycles. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for fixed $k$ which outputs one of the two outcomes. Using this algorithmic result, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for fixed $k$ to decide whether such $k$ directed odd cycles exist, or there are no $k$ vertex-disjoint directed odd cycles. This extends the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa theorem for undirected odd cycles by Reed [Combinatorica 1999] to directed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.09091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mixed graph is, informally, an object obtained from a simple undirected graph by choosing an orientation for a subset of its edges. A mixed graph is $(m, n)$-coloured if each edge is assigned one of $m \geq 0$ colours, and each arc is assigned one of $n \geq 0$ colours. Oriented graphs are $(0, 1)$-coloured mixed graphs, and 2-edge-coloured graphs are $(2, 0)$-coloured mixed graphs. We show that results of Sopena for vertex colourings of oriented graphs, and of Kostochka, Sopena and Zhu for vertex colourings oriented graphs and 2-edge-coloured graphs, are special cases of results about vertex colourings of $(m, n)$-coloured mixed graphs. Both of these can be regarded as a version of Brooks' Theorem.</description>

Abstract: A cycle $C$ in a graph $G$ is called a Tutte cycle if, after deleting $C$ from $G$, each component has at most three neighbors on $C$. Tutte cycles play an important role in the study of Hamiltonicity of planar graphs. Thomas and Yu and independently Sanders proved the existence of Tutte cycles containining three specified edges of a facial cycle in a 2-connected plane graph. We prove a quantitative version of this result, bounding the number of components of the graph obtained by deleting a Tutte cycle. As a corollary, we can find long cycles in essentially 4-connected plane graphs that also contain three prescribed edges of a facial cycle.</description>

      <title>A Bilinear Bogolyubov Argument in Abelian Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.03093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bilinear Bogolyubov argument for $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ states that if we start with a dense set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n$ and carry out sufficiently many steps where we replace every row or every column of $A$ by the set difference of it with itself, then inside the resulting set we obtain a bilinear variety of codimension bounded in terms of density of $A$. In this paper, we generalize the bilinear Bogolyubov argument to arbitrary finite abelian groups. Namely, if $G$ and $H$ are finite abelian groups and $A \subseteq G \times H$ is a subset of density $\delta$, then the procedure above applied to $A$ results in a set that contains a bilinear analogue of a Bohr set, with the appropriately defined codimension bounded above by $\log^{O(1)} (O(\delta^{-1}))$.</description>

      <title>Finding an almost perfect matching in a hypergraph avoiding forbidden submatchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1973, Erd\H{o}s conjectured the existence of high girth $(n,3,2)$-Steiner systems. Recently, Glock, K\"{u}hn, Lo, and Osthus and independently Bohman and Warnke proved the approximate version of Erd\H{o}s' conjecture. Just this year, Kwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin proved Erd\H{o}s' conjecture. As for Steiner systems with more general parameters, Glock, K\"{u}hn, Lo, and Osthus conjectured the existence of high girth $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems. We prove the approximate version of their conjecture.
  This result follows from our general main results which concern finding perfect or almost perfect matchings in a hypergraph $G$ avoiding a given set of submatchings (which we view as a hypergraph $H$ where $V(H)=E(G)$). Our first main result is a common generalization of the classical theorems of Pippenger (for finding an almost perfect matching) and Ajtai, Koml\'os, Pintz, Spencer, and Szemer\'edi (for finding an independent set in girth five hypergraphs). More generally, we prove this for coloring and even list coloring, and also generalize this further to when $H$ is a hypergraph with small codegrees (for which high girth designs is a specific instance). Indeed, the coloring version of our result even yields an almost partition of $K_n^r$ into approximate high girth $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems.
  Our main results also imply the existence of a perfect matching in a bipartite hypergraph where the parts have slightly unbalanced degrees. This has a number of applications; for example, it proves the existence of $\Delta$ pairwise disjoint list colorings in the setting of Kahn's theorem; it also proves asymptotic versions of various rainbow matching results in the sparse setting (where the number of times a color appears could be much smaller than the number of colors) and even the existence of many pairwise disjoint rainbow matchings in such circumstances.</description>

      <title>Inequalities among Symmetric Polynomial Functions: Counter-examples and New Conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric polynomial functions are fundamental questions in mathematics and have various applications in science and engineering. This paper investigates a beautiful and inspiring conjecture, proposed by Cuttler, Greene and Skandera in 2011, on inequalities among the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial function $H_{n,\lambda}$: It states that the inequality $H_{n,\lambda}\leq H_{n,\mu}$ implies majorization order $\lambda\preceq\mu$. The conjecture is a close analogy with other known results on Muirhead-type inequalities. In 2021, Heaton and Shankar disproved the conjecture by showing a counterexample for number of variables $n=3$ and degree $d=8$. They then asked whether the conjecture is true when $n$ is sufficiently large. In this paper, we show, by a family of counter-examples, that the conjecture does not hold for any $n$ and any $d$ as long as $n\geq2$ and $d\geq8$. Based on the insights gained from the counter-examples, we propose a new conjecture for the inequality $H_{n,\lambda}\leq H_{n,\mu}$.</description>

      <title>A graph for which the second largest distance eigenvalue is less than $\frac{-3+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is chordal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00917v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with vertex set $V(G)$. The distance, $d_G(u,v)$, between vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ is defined as the length of a shortest path between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. The distance matrix of $G$ is the matrix $D(G)=(d_G(u,v))_{u,v\in V(G)}$. The second largest distance eigenvalue of $G$ is the second largest one in the spectrum of $D(G)$. We show that any connected graph with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $\frac{-3+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is chordal, and characterize those bicyclic graphs and split graphs with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their classical paper, Erd\H{o}s, Goodman and P\'{o}sa studied the representation of a graph with vertex set $[n]$ by a family of subsets $S_1,\dots, S_n$ with the property that $\{i,j\}$ is an edge if and only if $S_i\cap S_j\neq \emptyset$. In this note, we consider a similar representation of bounded degree $r$-uniform hypergraphs and establish some bounds for a corresponding problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Hamiltonian paths and cycles in undirected graphs from an operadic viewpoint. We show that the graphical collection $\mathsf{Ham}$ encoding directed Hamiltonian paths in connected graphs admits an operad-like structure, called a contractad. Similarly, we construct the graphical collection of Hamiltonian cycles $\mathsf{CycHam}$ that forms a right module over the contractad $\mathsf{Ham}$. We use the machinery of contractad generating series for counting Hamiltonian paths/cycles for particular types of graphs.</description>

      <title>Chromatic profiles of odd cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits asked the following question: For an integer $c\geq 2$ and a family of non-bipartite graphs $\mathcal{F}$, what is the infimum of $\alpha$ such that any $\mathcal{F}$-free $n$-vertex graph with $n$ large enough and minimum degree at least $\alpha n$ has chromatic number at most $c$? Denote the infimum as $\delta_{\chi}(\mathcal{F}, c)$. A fundamental result of Erd\H{o}s, Stone and Simonovits implies that if $3\le r+1=\chi(\mathcal{F})=\min\{\chi (F): F\in \mathcal{F}\}$, then for any $c\le r-1$, $\delta_{\chi}(\mathcal{F}, c)=1-{1 \over r}$. So the remaining challenge is to determine $\delta_{\chi}(\mathcal{F}, c)$ for $c\ge \chi (\mathcal{F})-1$. Most previous known results are under the condition that $c= \chi (\mathcal{F})-1$. When $c\ge \chi (\mathcal{F})$, the only known exact results are $\delta_{\chi}(K_3, 3)$ by H\"aggkvist and Jin, and $\delta_{\chi}(K_3, c)$ for every $c\ge4$ by Brandt and Thomass\'{e}, $\delta_{\chi}(K_r, r)$ and $\delta_{\chi}(K_r, r+1)$ by Goddard and Lyle, and Nikiforov. Combining results of Thomassen and Ma, $\Omega\bigg((c+1)^{-8(k+1)}\bigg)=\delta_{\chi}(C_{2k+1}, c)=O(\frac{k}{c})$ for $c\ge 3$. In this paper, we determine $\delta_{\chi}(C_{2k+1}, c)$ for all $c\ge 2$ and $k\ge 3c+4$. We also obtain the following corollary. If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with $c\ge 3$, $\chi(G)&gt;c$ and $\delta(G)&gt; {n \over 2c+2}$, then $C_{2k+1} \subset G$ for all $k\in [3c+4, {n \over 108(c+1)^c}]$. Methods to obtain all previous known results related to odd cycles cannot be applied to solve for $\delta_{\chi}(C_{2k+1}, c)$ for $c\ge 3$.The innovation of our proof is to give the concept of a `strong $2k$-core'. We think that this concept grasps the essence of the problem and it makes our proof concise and elementary (we do not need to borrow any other tools). How to define a proper `core' might be a key to this type of questions.</description>

      <title>On Bollob\'as-type theorems of $d$-tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1965, Bollob\'as proved that for a Bollob\'as set-pair system $\{(A_i,B_i)\mid i\in[m]\}$, the maximum value of $\sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{A_i}^{-1}$ is $1$. In 2023, Heged\"{u}s and Frankl generalize the concept of Bollob\'as system to $d$-tuples, and made a conjecture: Suppose $\{(A_i^{(1)},\ldots,A_i^{(d)})\mid i\in[m]\}$ is a Bollob\'as system of $d$-tuples, the maximum value of $\sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i^{(1)}|+\cdots+|A_i^{(d)}|}{|A_i^{(1)}|,\ldots,|A_i^{(d)}|}^{-1}$ is also $1$. In this paper, we show this conjecture is not correct, and we give an upper bound of it. In the case $d=3$, our upper bound is tight in the mean of asymptotic. We also improve an inequality for skew Bollob\'as systems of $d$-tuples of Heged\"{u}s and Frankl, and determine the maximum size or a uniform skew Bollob\'as system.</description>

      <title>Equivalence classes of lower and upper descent weak Bruhat intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Int}(n)$ denote the set of nonempty left weak Bruhat intervals in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$. We investigate the equivalence relation $\overset{D}{\simeq}$ on $\mathrm{Int}(n)$, where $I \overset{D}{\simeq} J$ if and only if there exists a descent-preserving poset isomorphism between $I$ and $J$. For each equivalence class $C$ of $(\mathrm{Int}(n), \overset{D}{\simeq})$, a partial order $\preceq$ is defined by $[\sigma, \rho]_L \preceq [\sigma', \rho']_L$ if and only if $\sigma \preceq_R \sigma'$. Kim-Lee-Oh (2023) showed that the poset $(C, \preceq)$ is isomorphic to a right weak Bruhat interval.
  In this paper, we focus on lower and upper descent weak Bruhat intervals, specifically those of the form $[w_0(S), \sigma]_L$ or $[\sigma, w_1(S)]_L$, where $w_0(S)$ is the longest element in the parabolic subgroup $\mathfrak{S}_S$ of $\mathfrak{S}_n$, generated by $\{s_i \mid i \in S\}$ for a subset $S \subseteq [n-1]$, and $w_1(S)$ is the longest element among the minimal-length representatives of left $\mathfrak{S}_{[n-1] \setminus S}$-cosets in $\mathfrak{S}_n$. We begin by providing a poset-theoretic characterization of the equivalence relation $\overset{D}{\simeq}$. Using this characterization, the minimal and maximal elements within an equivalence class $C$ are identified when $C$ is a lower or upper descent interval. Under an additional condition, a detailed description of the structure of $(C, \preceq)$ is provided. Furthermore, for the equivalence class containing $[w_0(S), \sigma]_L$, an injective hull of ${\sf B}([w_0(S), \sigma]_L)$ is given, and for the equivalence class containing $[\sigma, w_1(S)]_L$, a projective cover of ${\sf B}([\sigma, w_1(S)]_L)$ is given.</description>

      <title>Hindman's finite sums theorem and its application to topologizations of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.01947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of the paper is a brief overview of Hindman's finite sums theorem, its prehistory and a few of its further generalizations, and a modern technique used in proving these and similar results, which is based on idempotent ultrafilters in ultrafilter extensions of semigroups. The second, main part of the paper is devoted to the topologizability problem of a wide class of algebraic structures called polyrings; this class includes Abelian groups, rings, modules, algebras over a ring, differential rings, and others. We show that the Zariski topology of such an algebra is always non-discrete. Actually, a much stronger fact holds: if $K$ is an infinite polyring, $n$ a natural number, and a map $F$ of $K^n$ into $K$ is defined by a term in $n$ variables, then $F$ is a closed nowhere dense subset of the space $K^{n+1}$ with its Zariski topology. In particular, $K^n$ is a closed nowhere dense subset of $K^{n+1}$. The proof essentially uses a multidimensional version of Hindman's finite sums theorem. The third part of the paper lists several problems concerning topologization of various algebraic structures, their Zariski topologies, and related questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.05214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a characterization of generic pseudo-Anosov mapping classes purely in terms of their expressions in the shear coordinates, thus giving an answer to a problem raised by Papadopoulos--Penner [PP93]. This characterization has a cluster algebraic generalization called the sign stability introduced in [IK21]. By combining with the results in [IK21], we see that the algebraic entropies of the cluster $\mathcal{A}$- and $\mathcal{X}$-transformations induced by a generic pseudo-Anosov mapping class both coincide with its topological entropy.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for every infinite set $E\subset \mathbb Z$, there is a set $S\subset E-E$ which is a set of topological recurrence and not a set of measurable recurrence. This extends a result of Igor Kriz, proving that there is a set of topological recurrence which is not a set of measurable recurrence. Our construction follows Kriz's closely, and this paper can be considered an exposition of the original argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of integers greater than 1 is primitive if no member in the set divides another. Erd\H{o}s proved in 1935 that the series $f(A) = \sum_{a\in A}1/(a \log a)$ is uniformly bounded over all choices of primitive sets $A$. In 1986 he asked if this bound is attained for the set of prime numbers. In this article we answer in the affirmative. As further applications of the method, we make progress towards a question of Erd\H{o}s, S\'ark\"ozy, and Szemer\'edi from 1968. We also refine the classical Davenport-Erd\H{o}s theorem on infinite divisibility chains, and extend a result of Erd\H{o}s, S\'ark\"ozy, and Szemer\'edi from 1966.</description>

      <title>Idempotentization of Affine Schemes and Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the idempotentization process, which bears some philosophical and mathematical similarities with modern analytification and tropicalization. Idempotentization associates to any affine scheme an idempotent version of itself with respect to a fixed covering by distinguished affine open subschemes. Once this cover is fixed, we can functorially associate a Zariski sheaf of rings or modules to a sheaf of idempotent semiring or a sheaf of idempotent semimodules. We show that idempotentization is independent of the chosen cover and in the Noetherian case, the idempotentization of the structure sheaf recovers the global sections. Underlying our formalism is a combinatorial reflection of lattices of subobjects of ordered-theoretic objects seen as lattices coming from commutative algebra. This has topological consequences for the semiring of subtractive ideals of a commutative semiring $S$: On one hand, it is a topological retract of the semiring of congruence relations of $S$ for the coarse lower topology. On the other hand, it is a topological retract of the semiring of ideals of $S$ for the coarse upper topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the externally definable Ramsey property, a weakening of the Ramsey property for ultrahomogeneous structures, where the only colourings considered are those that are externally definable: that is, definable with parameters in an elementary extension. We show a number of basic results analogous to the classical Ramsey theory, and show that, for an ultrahomogeneous structure M with countable age, the externally definable Ramsey property is equivalent to the dynamical statement that, for each natural number n, every subflow of the space of n-types with parameters in M has a fixed point. We discuss a range of examples, including results regarding the lexicographic product of structures.</description>

      <title>Intersecting subsets in finite permutation groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ be transitive, and let $S$ be an intersecting subset, namely, the ratio $xy^{-1}$ of any elements $x,y\in S$ fixes some point. An EKR-type problem is to characterize transitive groups $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ such that any intersecting set is upper bounded by $|G_\omega|$, where $\omega\in\Omega$. A nice result of Meagher-Spiga-Tiep (2016) tells us that if $G$ is 2-transitive, then indeed $|S|\leqslant|G_\omega|$. A natural next step would be to explore intersecting subsets for primitive groups and quasiprimitive groups. Our study in this paper shows that for quasiprimitive permutation groups, the size $|S|$ can be arbitrarily larger than $|G_\omega|$. We conjecture that for quasiprimitve groups, the upperbound for $|S|$ is $O(|G_\omega||\Omega|^{1\over2})$. As a starting point, we prove that ${|S|/(|G_\omega||\Omega|^{1\over2}})\leqslant{\sqrt2/2}$ for all quasiprimitive actions of the Suzuki groups $G=\mathrm{Sz}(q)$. To show that our conjectured upper bound is tight, we provide examples of groups for which ${|S|/(|G_\omega||\Omega|^{1\over2}})$ is arbitrarily close to ${\sqrt2/2}$. As far as general transitive groups concerned, infinity families of examples produced show that the ratio ${|S|/(|G_\omega||\Omega|^{1\over2}})$ can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>An extension of the cogrowth formula to arbitrary subsets of the tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the probability that a random walk in the free group ends in a proper power? Or in a primitive element? We present a formula that computes the exponential decay rate of the probability that a random walk on a regular tree ends in a given subset, in terms of the exponential decay rate of the analogous probability of the non-backtracking random walk. This generalizes the well-known cogrowth formula of Grigorchuk, Cohen and Northshield. We also extend the formula to arbitrary subsets of the biregular tree.</description>

      <title>Bier spheres and toric topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the real and complex Buchstaber numbers of an arbitrary Bier sphere. In dimension two, we identify all the 13 different combinatorial types of Bier spheres and show that 12 of them are nerve complexes of nestohedra, while the remaining one is a nerve complex of a generalized permutohedron. As an application of our results, we construct a regular normal fan for each of those 13 Delzant polytopes, compute the cohomology rings of the corresponding nonsingular projective toric varieties, and examine the orientability of the corresponding small covers.</description>

      <title>Period patterns, entry points, and orders in the Lucas sequences: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) extend theory on certain statistics in the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences modulo $m$ to the Lucas sequences $U := \left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $V := \left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and (2) apply some of this theory to a novel graphical approach of $U$ and $V$ modulo $m$. Upon placing the cycle of repeating sequence terms in a circle, several fascinating patterns which would otherwise be overlooked emerge. We generalize a wealth of known Fibonacci and Lucas statistical identities to the $U$ and $V$ settings using primary sources such as Lucas in 1878, Carmichael in 1913, Wall in 1960, and Vinson in 1963, amongst others. We use many of these generalized identities to form the theoretical basis for our graphical results. Based on the order of $m$, defined as $\omega(m) := \frac{\pi(m)}{e(m)}$, where $\pi(m)$ is the period of $m$ and $e(m)$ is the entry point of $m$, we describe behaviors shared by $U$ and $V$ with parameters $q = \pm 1$. In particular, we exhibit some tantalizing examples in the following three sequence pairs: Fibonacci and Lucas, Pell and associated Pell, and balancing and Lucas-balancing.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory for weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and let $d$ be a positive integer. In this paper, we generalize Iwasawa theory for graphs initiated by Gonet and Valli\`{e}res to weighted graphs. In particular, we prove an analogue of Iwasawa's class number formula and that of Kida's formula for compatible systems of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^d$-covers of weighted graphs. We also provide numerical examples. At the end of this paper, we give an application of the ideas of Iwasawa theory to the theory of discrete-time quantum walks in graphs.</description>
