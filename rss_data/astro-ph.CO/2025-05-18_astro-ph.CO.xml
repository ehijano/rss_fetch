      <title>Searching optimal scales for reconstructing cosmological initial conditions using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the initial density field of the Universe from the late-time matter distribution is a nontrivial task with implications for understanding structure formation in cosmology, offering insights into early Universe conditions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in tackling this problem by learning the complex mapping from nonlinear evolved fields back to initial conditions. Here we investigate the effect of varying input sub-box size in single-input CNNs. We find that intermediate scales ($L_\mathrm{sub} \sim 152\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) strike the best balance between capturing local detail and global context, yielding the lowest validation loss and most accurate recovery across multiple statistical metrics. We then propose a dual-input model that combines two sub-boxes of different sizes from the same simulation volume. This model significantly improves reconstruction performance, especially on small scales over the best single-input case, despite utilizing the same parent simulation box. This demonstrates the advantage of explicitly incorporating multi-scale context into the network. Our results highlight the importance of input scale and network design in reconstruction tasks. The dual-input approach represents a simple yet powerful enhancement that leverages fixed input information more efficiently, paving the way for more accurate cosmological inference from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work 2305.04946, we found that supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation data support the hypothesis that late time cosmic acceleration is caused by the potential energy of a scalar field descending its potential, as suggested by holographically defined models of quantum gravity. In this note, we update our analysis using the Dark Energy Survey 5 year supernova data set (DES-SN5YR) and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Approximating the scalar potential via a first order Taylor series $V \approx V_0 + V_1 \phi$ about the present value, and making use of only recent-time data from DES-SN5YR and DESI DR2, we find that the slope parameter is constrained as $V_1 = 1.49 \pm 0.25$ in a standard likelihood analysis. This is naively a $&gt;5 \sigma$ discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM (which has $V_1 =0$), though a more detailed analysis not assuming a Gaussian likelihood distribution suggests $4 \sigma$ significance. Based only on the $\Delta \chi^2 = -13.7$ improvement of fit while ignoring parameter space volumes disfavours $\Lambda$CDM at a $3 \sigma$ significance level. These significance measures are substantially improved from our previous analysis using older data sets. We also reproduce the DESI DR2 parameter constraints based on the same combination of data and find that the $\Lambda$CDM is more strongly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential extension (dubbed $V_0V_1$) as compared with the $w_0 w_a$ extension of $\Lambda$CDM. A caveat is that for both $w_0 w_a$ and $V_0 V_1$, much of the significance relies on the historical $z &lt; 0.1$ supernova samples included in the DES-SN5YR data set.</description>

      <title>The Manticore Project I: a digital twin of our cosmic neighbourhood from Bayesian field-level analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Manticore project, dubbed Manticore-Local, a suite of Bayesian constrained simulations of the nearby Universe, generated by fitting a physical structure formation model to the 2M++ galaxy catalogue using the BORG algorithm. This field-level inference yields physically consistent realizations of cosmic structure, leveraging a nonlinear gravitational solver, a refined galaxy bias model, and physics-informed priors. The Manticore-Local posterior realizations evolve within a parent cosmological volume statistically consistent with LCDM, demonstrated through extensive posterior predictive tests of power spectra, bispectra, initial condition Gaussianity, and the halo mass function. The inferred local supervolume shows no significant deviation from cosmological expectations; notably, we find no evidence for a large local underdensity. Our model identifies high-significance counterparts for fourteen prominent galaxy clusters each within one degree of its observed sky position. Across the posterior ensemble, these counterparts are consistently detected with 2-4 sigma significance, and their reconstructed masses and redshifts agree closely with observational estimates, confirming the inference's spatial and dynamical fidelity. The peculiar velocity field recovered by Manticore-Local achieves the highest Bayesian evidence across five datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Unlike methods yielding only point estimates or using simplified dynamics, Manticore-Local provides a full Bayesian posterior over cosmic structure and evolution, enabling rigorous uncertainty quantification. These results establish Manticore-Local as the most advanced constrained realization suite of the Local Universe to date, offering a robust statistical foundation for future studies of galaxy formation, velocity flows, and environmental dependencies in our cosmic neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as dark matter candidates: Multi-frequency constraints from cosmic radiation backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. This study investigates the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in shaping cosmic radiation backgrounds--the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), the Lyman-Werner background (LWB), and the cosmic radio background (CRB)--and evaluates their viability as dark matter (DM) candidates based on observational constraints and theoretical limits. Methods. PBH accretion is modelled using analytical frameworks that include electron advection-dominated accretion flows (eADAF), standard advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAF), luminous hot accretion flows (LHAF), and thin disks. Emission from PBHs in both dark matter halos and the intergalactic medium (IGM) is computed. We assess the impact of variations in model assumptions, such as halo gas density profiles, gas velocities, and emission models. The results are compared with observational limits and theoretical thresholds to constrain the PBH fraction as DM for masses between 1 and 100 solar masses Results. PBHs may contribute up to 99, 93, 80, and 91 per cent of the unresolved soft X-ray background for masses of 1, 10, 33, and 100 solar masses, respectively, and about 33-39 per cent of the hard X-ray background. These contributions limit the PBH DM fraction to 7e-3, 6e-4, 6e-4, and 7e-4, respectively, in our baseline model. These constraints are consistent with those from the LWB, ensuring molecular cooling and early star formation are preserved. However, explaining the radio background excess and the EDGES signal would require PBH fractions well above these limits. For 1 solar mass, excluding ADAF subregimes relaxes the constraint to 3e-2, highlighting the sensitivity to accretion physics. Variations in model assumptions introduce only minor differences in the predicted backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Redshift Evolution of the Intrinsic Alignments of Galaxies and Subhalos in the Horizon Run 5 Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift evolution of intrinsic alignments of the shapes of galaxies and subhalos with the large-scale structures of the universe using the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, $\textit{Horizon Run 5}$. To this end, early-type galaxies are selected from the simulated galaxy catalogs based on stellar mass and kinematic morphology. The shapes of galaxies and subhalos are computed using the reduced inertia tensor derived from mass-weighted particle positions. We find that the misalignment between galaxies and their corresponding dark-matter subhalos decreases over time. We further analyze the two-point correlation between galaxy or subhalo shapes and the large-scale density field traced by their spatial distribution, and quantify the amplitude using the nonlinear alignment model across a wide redshift range from $z = 0.625$ to $z = 2.5$. We find that the intrinsic alignment amplitude, $A_{\rm NLA}$, of galaxies remains largely constant with redshift, whereas that of dark matter subhalos exhibits moderate redshift evolution, with a power-law slope that deviates from zero at a significance level exceeding $3\sigma$. Additionally, $A_{\rm NLA}$ is found to depend on both the stellar mass and kinematic morphology of galaxies. Notably, our results are broadly consistent with existing observational constraints. Our findings are in good agreement with previous results of other cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Precise calculation of the EFT likelihood with primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a precise calculation of the EFT conditional likelihood for large-scale structure (LSS) via the saddle-point expansion method in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). The precision is manifested at two levels: one corresponding to the consideration of higher-order noise terms, and the other to the inclusion of contributions around the saddle points. In computing the latter, we encounter the same issue of the negative modes as in the context of false vacuum decay, which necessitates deforming the original integration contour into the combination of the steepest descent contours to ensure a convergent and real result. We demonstrate through detailed calculations that, upon the incorporation of leading-order PNG, both types of extensions introduce irreducible field-dependent contributions to the conditional likelihood. This insight motivates the systematic inclusion of additional effective terms within the forward modeling framework. Our work facilitates Bayesian forward modeling under non-Gaussian initial conditions, thereby enabling more stringent constraints on the parameters describing PNG.</description>

      <title>The Giant Arc -- Filament of Figment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called "Giant Arc" is a sparse pattern of MgII absorbers spanning approximately 740 comoving Mpc, whose discovery has been claimed to contradict the large-scale homogeneity inherent to the standard cosmological model. We previously showed that, with the same algorithm and parameters used for its discovery, very similar patterns are abundant in uniform random distributions, and among equivalent halo samples in a cosmological simulation of the standard model. In a response, the original discoverers of the "Giant Arc" have argued that these parameters were only appropriate for their specific observational data, but that a smaller linking length should be used for control studies, in which case far fewer patterns are detected. We briefly review and disprove these arguments, and demonstrate that large patterns like the "Giant Arc" are indeed ubiquitous in a statistically homogeneous universe.</description>

      <title>The Parameter Dependence of $\mathbf{n_{s}}$ and $\mathbf{r}$ of the Scalar Power Spectrum during Single-Field Slow-Roll Inflation: A Comparative Study of Inflationary Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation in cosmology is a specific stage preceding the Big Bang, aimed at solving both old background problems and new perturbation issues. Single-field inflation is a candidate to illustrate the picture of the initial universe, and various potential functions lead to different scenarios during the inflationary stage. This paper introduces two essential parameters: the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio detected from the initial power spectrum, derived from the action of the scalar field and using approximation that the potential is flat. A brief overview of the origins of Starobinsky Inflation, Chaotic Inflation, Small Field Inflation, and Natural Inflation is also presented, along with their mathematical representations. Finally, the results derived from various inflation models regarding the index and ratio are tested using the Planck data, and the deviations in each model are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Dark standard siren cosmology with bright galaxy subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper, we investigate the impact of selecting only a subset of bright galaxies to provide redshift information for a dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. Employing gravitational-wave observations from the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC-3) in conjunction with the GLADE+ galaxy catalogue, we show that restricting to bright galaxy subsets can enhance the precision of the $H_0$ estimate by up to $80\%$ in the most favorable scenario. A comprehensive assessment of systematic uncertainties is still required. This work lays the foundation for employing alternative tracers -- such as brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and luminous red galaxies (LRGs) -- in gravitational-wave cosmology, particularly at redshifts where conventional galaxy catalogues offer limited coverage.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Dynamics of Mutated Hilltop Inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity Under New Slow-Roll Approximations with Generalised Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement in the observational cosmology of the early universe such as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, puts severe constraints on the inflationary models. Many inflationary models have been ruled out by CMB, nevertheless the models ruled out in standard cold inflationary scenarios can be resurrected in modified gravity models. In this regard we examine the dynamics of inflation within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) Gravity using the new slow-roll approximation methods proposed in Pozdeeva et al. (2024). We consider the Mutated Hilltop inflation model (Pal et al., 2010; Pinhero and Pal, 2019) due to its origin from super-gravity, a naturally perfect choice to study the impact of EGB on inflationary observables such as tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) and scalar spectral index ($n_s$). The period of reheating following the inflationary phase is also examined, and for the {\it Planck'18} permitted values of $n_s$, constraints on the reheating temperature ($T_{re}$) are computed for various equations of states during reheating ($\omega_{re}$).</description>

      <title>Phantom matters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations of the recent universe suggest that dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is growing with time, departing from a cosmological constant for which $w=-1$. Standard quintessence models allow for a varying $w\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w&lt;-1$, is quickly reached in the past. Often discarded because of uncertainties or parametrisation, we rather propose here to embrace the reality of this phantom regime. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a coupling of quintessence field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation). We show that this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with string-inspired models, where $V=V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \varphi}$ and $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$. Those provide solutions in very good agreement with observations, including the phantom regime. We then discuss poles that can appear in $w$, making it diverge at recent times ($z\leq 4$), and that could be detected by observations. We finally comment on an Early Dark Energy-like feature, that systematically appears for free from the models considered, and could be of interest for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee: Final Report and Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).</description>

      <title>The redshift evolution of the luminosity function of type II GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As of December 2023, the Swift satellite has detected more than 1600 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
  We select 307 Type II GRBs for constructing the luminosity function (LF) based on the following criteria: (1) duration $T_{90} \geq 2 s$; (2) conformity with the Amati relation for Type II GRBs; and (3) peak flux $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$. We explore two general forms of the GRB LF: a broken power-law (BPL) LF and a triple power-law (TPL) LF. We consider three evolutionary scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. We find that the no evolution model can be excluded, while both luminosity and density evolution models effectively account for the observations. This result is consistent with previous studies on long GRBs (LGRBs). However, our Type II GRB sample favors a BPL LF, in contrast to the preference for a TPL function discovered in Long GRBs.</description>

      <title>Redshift evolution of Lyman continuum escape fraction after JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LyC escape fraction from galaxies, $f_{\rm esc}$, is strongly boosted by galactic outflows. In the Attenuation-Free Model (AFM) accounting for the properties of $z&gt;10$ galaxies, radiation-driven outflows develop once the galaxy specific star formation rate, ${\rm sSFR} \ge {\rm sSFR}^* \approx 25\ {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$. As the cosmic sSFR increases with redshift, so does $f_{\rm esc}(z)$, which, when globally averaged, grows from 0.007 to 0.6 in $0 &lt; z &lt; 20$. We successfully tested the model on specific data sub-samples. Our predictions are consistent with direct measurements of $f_{\rm esc}$ up to $z=6.5$, and provide a physical explanation for the observed decreasing trend of the mean UV galaxy spectral slope, $\beta$, towards high-$z$.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Magnetogenesis at the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous CP violation during the electroweak phase transition can induce a twisting of the magnetic field configuration of Standard Model dumbbells, resulting in sizable intergalactic magnetic fields and a small baryon asymmetry, in agreement with observations. We demonstrate this by coupling the electroweak gauge group of the Standard Model to an axion-like particle with a non-vanishing velocity. Studying the resulting monopole, string and dumbbell configurations, we conclude that the helicity fraction of the magnetic fields generated at the electroweak phase transition is roughly given by the dimensionless axion velocity.</description>

      <title>Graviton-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Prototype sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating on alumina filters for ground-based CMB telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present designs and fabrication of sub-wavelength anti-reflection (AR) structures on alumina for infrared absorptive filters with passbands near 30, 125, and 250 GHz. These bands are widely used by ground-based instruments measuring the cosmic microwave background radiation. The designs are tuned to provide reflectance of 2% or less for fractional bandwidths between 51% and 72%, with each of the three primary bands containing two sub-bands. We make the sub-wavelength structures (SWS), which resemble a two-dimensional array of pyramids, using laser ablation. We measure the shapes of the fabricated pyramids and show that for incidence angles up to 20 degrees the predicted in-band average reflectance is 2% or less, in agreement with the design. The band average instrumental polarization is less than $3\times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Miracle: A Remarkably Luminous Galaxy at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44$ Confirmed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, $z&gt;10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous ($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS legacy field at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and $\approx3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\approx14-15$ sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning $\approx350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $&gt;100\times$ larger ($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines (${\approx}15{-}35$ \AA) signal a rising star-formation history, with a ${\approx}10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\approx100\%$ neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$&gt;1$ hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Cosmic curvature on large-scale structures with homogeneous dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of cosmic curvature on structure formation through general relativistic first-order perturbation theory. We analyze continuity and Euler equations, incorporating cosmic curvature into Einstein equations. Emphasizing late-time dynamics, we investigate matter density contrast evolution in the presence of cosmic curvature, with a specific focus on sub-hubble scales. Solving the evolution equation, we conduct data analysis using cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) (including $r_d$ constraint from CMB), type Ia supernova observations from Pantheon+ sample, logarithmic growth rate $f$ data and $f\sigma_8$ data. While constraints on some parameters remain consistent, inclusion of cosmic curvature losens constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 8,0}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0$CDM models. The non-phantom behavior of dark energy proves more favorable in $w_0$CDM model, whereas in CPL model, there is certain evidence for non-phantom behaviour at lower redshift and phantom behaviour at higher redshift. Interestingly, we find certain evidence for non-zero cosmic curvature in $\Lambda$CDM model, but no evidence for it in both $w_0$CDM and CPL models, which indirectly proves the non-degeneracy between dynamical dark energy and cosmic curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this analysis we apply a model-independent framework to test the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology using simulated SNIa data from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and combined with simulated Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) five-years Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. We adopt an iterative smoothing technique to reconstruct the expansion history from SNIa data, which, when combined with BAO measurements, facilitates a comprehensive test of the Universe's curvature and the nature of dark energy. The analysis is conducted under four different mock true cosmologies: Two curvatures ($\Omega_{k,0}=0$ and 0.1) and two models of dark energy: a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the phenomenologically emergent dark energy. We forecast that our reconstruction technique can constrain cosmological parameters, such as the curvature ($\Omega_{k,0}$) and $c/(H_0 r_\mathrm{d})$, with spread due to the SNIa uncertainties up to $\pm 4\%$ and $\pm 0.1$ respectively, without assuming any form of dark energy.</description>

      <title>First confirmation of anisotropic halo bias from statistically anisotropic matter distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12004v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm for the first time the existence of distinctive halo bias associated with the quadrupolar type of statistical anisotropy (SA) of the linear matter density field using cosmological $N$-body simulations. We find that the coefficient of the SA-induced bias for cluster-sized halos takes negative values and exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing halo mass. This results in the quadrupole halo power spectra in a statistically anisotropic universe being less amplified compared to the monopole spectra. The anisotropic feature in halo bias that we found presents a promising new tool for testing the hypothesis of a statistically anisotropic universe, with significant implications for the precise verification of anisotropic inflation scenarios and vector dark matter and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Validating a main beam treatment of parametric, pixel-based component separation in the context of CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a simple, main beam correction in the maximum-likelihood, parametric component separation approach, which allows on accounting for different beamwidths of input maps at different frequencies without any preprocessing. We validate the approach on full-sky and cut-sky simulations and discuss the importance and impact of the assumptions and simplifications.
  We find that, in the cases when the underlying sky model is indeed parametric, the method successfully recovers component spectral parameters and component maps at the pre-defined resolution.
  The improvement on the precision of the estimated spectral parameters is found to be minor due to the redness of the foreground angular spectra, however the method is potentially more accurate, in particular if the foreground properties display strong, spatial variability, as it does not assume commutation of the beam smoothing and mixing matrix operators. The method permits a reconstruction of the CMB map with a resolution significantly superior to that of the lowest resolution map used in the analysis and with the nearly optimal noise level, facilitating exploitation of the cosmological information contained on angular scales, which would be otherwise inaccessible.
  The method preserves all the advantages of a pixel-domain implementation of the parametric approach, and, as it deals with the beams in the harmonic domain, it can also straightforwardly account for spatially stationary map-domain noise correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent $2-4\sigma$ deviations from the Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$ suggest that dark energy (DE) may be dynamical, based on baryon acoustic oscillations and full-shape galaxy clustering (FS GC) analyses. This calls for even tighter DE constraints to narrow down its true nature. In this Letter, we explore how galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA) can enhance the FS GC-based DE constraints, using Fisher forecasts on various extensions of dynamical DE models, including scenarios with curvature, massive neutrinos, and modified gravity. Incorporating IA improves the DE Figure-of-Merit by $42-57\%$ and tightens the primordial power spectrum amplitude constraints by $17-19\%$. Our findings highlight IA's potential as a valuable cosmological probe complementary to GC.</description>

Abstract: Inflationary models that involve bursts of particle production generate bump-like features in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations. These features influence the evolution of density fluctuations, leaving their unique signatures in cosmological observations. A detailed investigation of such signatures would help constrain physical processes during inflation. With this motivation, the goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we conduct a detailed analysis of the effects of bump-like primordial features on the sky-averaged 21 cm signal. Using semi-numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the primordial features can significantly alter the ionization history and the global 21 cm profile, making them a promising probe of inflationary models. We found a special scale (namely, the turnover wavenumber, $k^{\rm turn}$) at which the effect of primordial bump-like features on the global 21 cm profile vanishes. Also, we found that the behaviour of the primordial features on the global profile and ionization history are quite opposite for $k &gt; k^{\rm turn}$ and $k &lt; k^{\rm turn}$. We trace the root cause of these behaviours to the effects of primordial features on the halo mass function at high redshifts. Furthermore, we discuss the degeneracy between the astrophysical parameters and the primordial features in detail. Secondly, for a fixed set of astrophysical parameters, we derive upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features in the range $10^{-1} &lt; k\,[{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] &lt; 10^2$ using current limits on optical depth to reionization from CMB data by Planck.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>Calibration requirements for Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal observations -- IV. Bias and variance with time and frequency correlated residual gains</title>

Abstract: Observation of multifrequency angular power spectrum of the redshifted 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation from the neutral hydrogen holds the key to understand the structure formation and its evolution during the reionization and post-reionization era. A major challenge in observing the neutral hydrogen arises from presence of strong foreground signals in the frequency range of interest. Mitigating the direct effect of foregrounds are being addressed through various techniques in literature. An additional second order effect arises, in presence of foreground, with limited accuracy in time and frequency dependent gain calibrations. This manifests as the residual gain and bandpass error in the observed data, introduces bias and increases uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum. In this work, we present an analytic method to estimate the bias and excess uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum in presence of residual gain and bandpass errors. We use this framework to estimate the effect of these errors for detection of redshifted 21-cm emission from a redshift of $\sim 8$ with the upcoming SKA1-Low. Due to the high baseline density at the required range of angular multipoles, the SKA1-Low is found to be a tuned instrument for the redshifted 21-cm signal detection. We find that, there are scenario with residual gain and bandpass errors where there can be significant bias in these estimates. Certain foreground mitigation strategies, is expected to reduce a part of the bias. The detailed study of different aspects of gain and bandpass errors and their relative effects are discussed. We find, with assumed models of gain and bandpass errors, signal detection is possible at this redshift with $128$ hours of observations. However, to achieve this one needs to have better calibration accuracy than present day interferometers.</description>

      <title>Probing gravity with non-linear clustering in redshift space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first computation of the gravity model testing parameter $E_G$ on realistic simulated modified gravity galaxy mocks. The analysis is conducted using two twin simulations presented in arXiv:1805.09824(1): one based on general relativity (GR) and the other on the $f(R)$ Hu $\&amp;$ Sawicki model with $f=10^{-5}$ (F5). This study aims to measure the $E_G$ estimator in GR and $f(R)$ models using high-fidelity simulated galaxy catalogs, with the goal of assessing how future galaxy surveys can detect deviations from standard gravity. Deriving this estimator requires precise, unbiased measurements of the growth rate of structure and the linear galaxy bias. We achieve this by implementing an end-to-end cosmological analysis pipeline in configuration space, using the multipoles of the 2-point correlation function. Our analysis demonstrates how to measure the scale-dependent growth rate predicted by non-standard gravity models. We split the estimation of the RSD $\beta$ parameter over distinct scale ranges, separating large (quasi-linear) and small (non-linear) scales. We show that this estimator can be accurately measured using mock galaxies in low redshift bins ($z &lt; 1$), where it offers strong discriminating power over competing gravity theories. We find that, for an all-sky galaxy survey and neglecting observational systematics, accurate and largely unbiased estimations of $E_G$ can be obtained across all redshifts. However, the error bars are too large to clearly distinguish between the theories. When measuring the scale-dependence of the $E_G$ estimator, we note that state-of-the-art theory modeling limitations and intrinsic "prior volume effects" prevent high-accuracy constraints. Alternatively, we propose a null test of gravity using RSD clustering, which, if small scales are modeled accurately in future surveys, could detect significant departures from GR.</description>

      <title>A $G_2$-Holonomy Model for Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration in M-theory: Alleviating the Hubble Tension through Geometric Vacuum Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework is presented within an eleven-dimensional M-theory scenario wherein dynamical geometric moduli, arising from a $G_2$-holonomy compactification, yield an evolving cosmological term $\Lambda(z)$. This ``geometric vacuum energy'' is distinct from conventional dark energy in two main aspects: (i) its origin lies in extra-dimensional fluxes and instanton-like corrections embedded within the moduli potential, and (ii) it exhibits a moderate peak at intermediate redshifts. This feature provides a mechanism to partially mitigate the Hubble tension, elevating the inferred $H_0$ value from $\sim67$ to $\sim69.5\ \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ without disrupting the overall concordance of the cosmological model. Furthermore, the inclusion of mild spatial openness ($\Omega_{k0}\approx 0.097$) and a slightly reduced matter fraction ($\Omega_{m0}\approx 0.25$) relative to standard $\Lambda$CDM allows the geometry-driven $\Lambda(z)$ to naturally maintain a cosmic age near $13.8\ \mathrm{Gyr}$. Initial numerical checks indicate that the calibrated model achieves $\chi^2/\nu \approx 1$ for $H(z)$ data ($\chi^2 \approx 26$ for 24 points) and yields a structure growth amplitude $S_8 \approx 0.74$, consistent with current observational bounds. While not a definitive solution, these results illustrate a potential pathway for reconciling certain late-time cosmological puzzles through a slight deviation from a pure cosmological constant, rooted in $G_2$-compactified M-theory. The findings suggest a UV-complete geometric origin for dark energy. Further developments, including detailed statistical analyses, $N$-body simulations, and explicit $G_2$ constructions, are anticipated to refine and test the parameter space of this model.</description>

      <title>Population III star formation in the presence of turbulence, magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence, magnetic fields and radiation feedback are key components that shape the formation of stars, especially in the metal-free environments at high redshifts where Population III stars form. Yet no 3D numerical simulations exist that simultaneously take all of these into account. We present the first suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH as part of the POPSICLE project. We include both turbulent magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback coupled to primordial chemistry, and resolve the collapse of primordial clouds down to few au. We find that dynamically strong magnetic fields significantly slow down accretion onto protostars, while ionizing feedback, as expected, is largely unable to weaken gas accretion at early times. This is because the partially ionized H II region gets trapped near the star due to insufficient radiative outputs from the star. The maximum stellar mass in the HD and RHD simulations that only yield one star exceeds $100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ within the first $5000\,\rm{yr}$. However, in the corresponding MHD and RMHD runs, the maximum mass of Population III stars is only $60\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$. In other realizations where we observe widespread fragmentation leading to the formation of Population III star clusters, the maximum stellar mass is further reduced by a factor of few due to fragmentation-induced starvation. We thus show that magnetic fields are more important than ionizing feedback in regulating the mass of the star during the earliest stages of Population III star formation.</description>

      <title>ProGeny I: a new simple stellar population spectra generator and impact of isochrones / stellar atmospheres / initial mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software (github.com/asgr/ProGeny) to generate simple/single stellar populations and their associated spectra (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available for immediate use. The most novel feature of ProGeny is its ability to produce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions, allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertainties and corrections for star formation rates and stellar masses are also presented.</description>

Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <title>A Stacked Analysis of GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from SPT-SZ Galaxy Clusters with 16 Years of Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a statistically significant detection of cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from a stacked sample of SPT-SZ selected galaxy clusters using 16.4 years of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope's Large Area Telescope (LAT). By analyzing a population of clusters with individual Test Statistic (TS) values $&lt;$ 9.0, we identify a robust cumulative signal with a TS of 75.2, which corresponds to approximately $8.4\sigma$ significance. In contrast, clusters with TS $&lt;$ 4.0 yield a weaker cumulative signal of TS equal to 9.65 (2.65$\sigma$), consistent with background fluctuations. The derived $\gamma$-ray spectrum is well characterized by a power law model with a best-fit spectral index of $-2.59 \pm 0.20$ and an integrated flux of $1.67^{+1.35}_{-1.07} \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The high TS values in the full sample are likely driven by AGN-dominated clusters. However, when clusters with TS between 4 and 9 are excluded, the remaining low-TS population shows a stacked signal consistent with hadronic emission.</description>

      <title>Cuscuton Bounce Beyond the Linear Regime: Bispectrum and Strong Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cuscuton Gravity is characterized as a scalar field that can be added to general relativity without introducing any new dynamical degrees of freedom on a cosmological background. Yet, it modifies gravity such that spacetime singularities can be avoided. This has led to the Cuscuton bounce, a nonsingular cosmology that has been shown to be linearly stable, which is a rare feat. Upon introducing mechanisms known to generate a near-scale-invariant power spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in the prebounce contracting phase, we perform an extensive linear analysis of all scalar perturbations as they evolve through the Cuscuton bounce, both analytically and numerically. Then, after deriving the third-order perturbed action for our theory, we compare the magnitude of its terms (on shell) to those in the second-order action. We show that perturbativity is maintained in the infrared throughout the evolution, including through the bounce. In the ultraviolet, we show that a hierarchy of scales is maintained, with the strong coupling scale well above the relevant background energy scale at all times. We reconfirm these results by computing the three-point functions in various limits and demonstrate that the models do not have any strong coupling problems and furthermore that there is negligible non-Gaussianities on observable scales. Consequently, the primary potential source of observable non-Gaussianities may only arise from the conversion of isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations. The whole scenario is thus a robust, stable, weakly coupled nonsingular cosmological model, consistent with observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euclid satellite is an ESA mission that was launched in July 2023. \Euclid is working in its regular observing mode with the target of observing an area of $14\,000~\text{deg}^2$ with two instruments, the Visible Camera (VIS) and the Near IR Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) down to $I_{\rm E} = 24.5~\text{mag}$ ($10\, \sigma$) in the Euclid Wide Survey. Ground-based imaging data in the \textit{ugriz} bands complement the \Euclid data to enable photo-$z$ determination and VIS PSF modeling for week lensing analysis. Euclid investigates the distance-redshift relation and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to $z\sim 2$. Generating the multi-wavelength catalogues from \Euclid and ground-based data is an essential part of the \Euclid data processing system. In the framework of the \Euclid Science Ground Segment (SGS), the aim of the MER Processing Function (PF) pipeline is to detect objects in the \Euclid imaging data, measure their properties, and MERge them into a single multi-wavelength catalogue. The MER PF pipeline performs source detection on both visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) images and offers four different photometric measurements: Kron total flux, aperture photometry on PSF-matched images, template fitting photometry, and S\'ersic fitting photometry. Furthermore, the MER PF pipeline measures a set of ancillary quantities, spanning from morphology to quality flags, to better characterise all detected sources. In this paper, we show how the MER PF pipeline is designed, detailing its main steps, and we show that the pipeline products meet the tight requirements that Euclid aims to achieve on photometric accuracy. We also present the other measurements (e.g. morphology) that are included in the OU-MER output catalogues and we list all output products coming out of the MER PF pipeline.</description>

      <title>Why $w \ne -1$? Anthropic Selection in a $\Lambda$ + Axion Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12852</link>

Abstract: We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological constant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse. Assuming that intelligent observers arise and observe, as in our universe, the onset of dark-energy-driven acceleration following matter domination, and that this acceleration persists to the present, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare cosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below because too light axions cannot achieve accelerated expansion due to their limited energy budget. As a result, the anthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \mathcal{O}(10)\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \ne -1$ may be expected. We also find that, for a decay constant slightly smaller than the Planck scale, the peak value of dark energy density is significantly smaller than the anthropic bound on the cosmological constant and can be close to the observed value. These outcomes are intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of time-varying dark energy, and offer a compelling anthropic explanation within the $\Lambda$ + axion framework.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Axion</title>

Abstract: We suggest that a gauge theory CP-violating phase could be degenerate with a magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux. Discrete discharge of this flux by membrane nucleations could reduce the total CP-violating phase to below $10^{-10}$ well before BBN if the charge and the tension of the membranes are in the $\sim keV$ range.</description>

      <title>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational wave observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly-explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</description>

      <title>The AGORA High-Resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project VII: Satellite quenching in zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-mass halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Satellite galaxies experience multiple physical processes when interacting with their host halos, often leading to the quenching of star formation. In the Local Group (LG), satellite quenching has been shown to be highly efficient, affecting nearly all satellites except the most massive ones. While recent surveys are studying Milky Way (MW) analogs to assess how representative our LG is, the dominant physical mechanisms behind satellite quenching in MW-mass halos remain under debate. Aims: We analyze satellite quenching within the same MW-mass halo, simulated using various widely-used astrophysical codes, each using different hydrodynamic methods and implementing different supernovae feedback recipes. The goal is to determine whether quenched fractions, quenching timescales and the dominant quenching mechanisms are consistent across codes or if they show sensitivity to the specific hydrodynamic method and supernovae (SNe) feedback physics employed. Methods: We use a subset of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a MW-mass halo from the multiple-code AGORA CosmoRun suite. Results: We find that the quenched fraction is consistent with the latest SAGA survey results within its 1$\sigma$ host-to-host scatter across all the models. Regarding quenching timescales, all the models reproduce the trend observed in the ELVES survey, LG observations, and previous simulations: the less massive the satellite, the shorter its quenching timescale. All our models converge on the dominant quenching mechanisms: strangulation halts cold gas accretion and ram pressure stripping is the predominant mechanism for gas removal, particularly effective in satellites with $M_* &lt; 10^8\, M_\odot$. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the stripping mechanisms differs among the codes, showing a strong sensitivity to the different SNe feedback implementations and/or hydrodynamic methods employed.</description>
