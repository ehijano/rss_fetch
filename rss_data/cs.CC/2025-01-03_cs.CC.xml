      <title>Special Coverings of Sets and Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will study some important properties of Boolean functions based on newly introduced concepts called Special Decomposition of a Set and Special Covering of a Set. These concepts enable us to study important problems concerning Boolean functions represented in conjunctive normal form including the satisfiability problem. Studying the relationship between the Boolean satisfiability problem and the problem of existence of a special covering for set we show that these problems are polynomially equivalent. This means that the problem of existence of a special covering for a set is an NP complete problem. We prove an important theorem regarding the relationship between these problems. The Boolean function in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable if and only if there is a special covering for the set of clauses of this function. The purpose of the article is also to study some important properties of satisfiable Boolean functions using the concepts of special decomposition and special covering of a set. We introduce the concept of generation of satisfiable function by another satisfiable function by means of admissible changes in the clauses of the function. We will prove that if the generation of a function by another function is defined as a binary relation then the set of satisfiable functions of n variables represented in conjunctive normal form with m clauses is partitioned to equivalence classes In addition, extending the rules of admissible changes we prove that arbitrary two satisfiable Boolean functions of n variables represented in conjunctive normal form with m clauses can be generated from each other.</description>

      <title>Hazard-free Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are one of the most fundamental computational models for computing Boolean functions $f : \{0, 1\}^n \mapsto \{0, 1\}$. It is well-known that the depth and size of decision trees are closely related to time and number of processors respectively for computing functions in the CREW-PRAM model. For a given $f$, a fundamental goal is to minimize the depth and/or the size of the decision tree computing it.
  In this paper, we extend the decision tree model to the world of hazard-free computation. We allow each query to produce three results: zero, one, or unknown. The output could also be: zero, one, or unknown, with the constraint that we should output "unknown" only when we cannot determine the answer from the input bits. This setting naturally gives rise to ternary decision trees computing functions, which we call hazard-free decision trees. We prove various lower and upper bounds on the depth and size of hazard-free decision trees and compare them to their Boolean counterparts. We prove optimal separations and relate hazard-free decision tree parameters to well-known Boolean function parameters. We show that the analogues of sensitivity, block sensitivity, and certificate complexity for hazard-free functions are all polynomially equivalent to each other and to hazard-free decision tree depth. i.e., we prove the sensitivity theorem in the hazard-free model. We then prove that hazard-free sensitivity satisfies an interesting structural property that is known to hold in the Boolean world. Hazard-free functions with small hazard-free sensitivity are completely determined by their values in any Hamming ball of small radius in $\{0, u, 1\}^n$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Explanations for Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal XAI is an emerging field that focuses on providing explanations with mathematical guarantees for the decisions made by machine learning models. A significant amount of work in this area is centered on the computation of "sufficient reasons". Given a model $M$ and an input instance $\vec{x}$, a sufficient reason for the decision $M(\vec{x})$ is a subset $S$ of the features of $\vec{x}$ such that for any instance $\vec{z}$ that has the same values as $\vec{x}$ for every feature in $S$, it holds that $M(\vec{x}) = M(\vec{z})$. Intuitively, this means that the features in $S$ are sufficient to fully justify the classification of $\vec{x}$ by $M$. For sufficient reasons to be useful in practice, they should be as small as possible, and a natural way to reduce the size of sufficient reasons is to consider a probabilistic relaxation; the probability of $M(\vec{x}) = M(\vec{z})$ must be at least some value $\delta \in (0,1]$, for a random instance $\vec{z}$ that coincides with $\vec{x}$ on the features in $S$. Computing small $\delta$-sufficient reasons ($\delta$-SRs) is known to be a theoretically hard problem; even over decision trees--traditionally deemed simple and interpretable models--strong inapproximability results make the efficient computation of small $\delta$-SRs unlikely. We propose the notion of $(\delta, \epsilon)$-SR, a simple relaxation of $\delta$-SRs, and show that this kind of explanation can be computed efficiently over linear models.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Several graphs $H$ are known for which $H$-IMC is \NP-complete, even when $H$ is a tree. In this paper, we investigate which conditions on $H$ and $G$ are sufficient so that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. Our results identify three infinite classes of graphs such that, if $H$ belongs to one of these classes, then $H$-IMC can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Nonassociative Lambek Calculus with classical logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nonassociative Lambek Calculus (NL) represents a logic devoid of the structural rules of exchange, weakening, and contraction, and it does not presume the associativity of its connectives. Its finitary consequence relation is decidable in polynomial time. However, the addition of classical connectives conjunction and disjunction (FNL) makes the consequence relation undecidable. Interestingly, if these connectives are distributive, the consequence relation is decidable in exponential time. This paper provides the proof that we can merge classical logic and NL (i.e. BFNL), and still the consequence relation is decidable in exponential time.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom quantum authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the pseudorandom quantum authentication scheme (PQAS), an efficient method for encrypting quantum states that relies solely on the existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). The scheme guarantees that for any eavesdropper with quantum polynomial-time (QPT) computational power, the encrypted states are indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. Furthermore, the receiver can verify that the state has not been tampered with and recover the original state with asymptotically unit fidelity. Our scheme is cost-effective, requiring only polylogarithmic circuit depth and a single shared key to encrypt a polynomial number of states. Notably, the PQAS can potentially exist even without quantum-secure one-way functions, requiring fundamentally weaker computational assumptions than semantic classical cryptography. Additionally, PQAS is secure against attacks that plague protocols based on QPT indistinguishability from Haar random states, such as chosen-plaintext attacks (CPAs) and attacks that reveal meta-information such as quantum resources. We relate the amount of meta-information that is leaked to quantum pseudoresources, giving the concept a practical meaning. As an application, we construct important cryptographic primitives, such as verifiable pseudorandom density matrices (VPRDMs), which are QPT-indistinguishable from random mixed states while being efficiently verifiable via a secret key, as well as verifiable noise-robust EFI pairs and one-way state generators (OWSGs). Our results establish a new paradigm of quantum information processing with weaker computational assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic study of "symmetric quantum circuits", a restricted model of quantum computation where the restriction is symmetry-based. This model is well-adapted for studying the role of symmetries in quantum speedups, and it extends a powerful notion of symmetric computation studied in the classical setting.
  We show that symmetric quantum circuits go beyond the capabilities of their classical counterparts by efficiently implementing key quantum subroutines such as amplitude amplification and phase estimation, as well as the linear combination of unitaries technique. In addition, we consider the task of symmetric state preparation and show that it can be performed efficiently in several interesting and nontrivial cases.</description>

      <title>On Solving Reachability in Grid Digraphs using a Psuedoseparator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.00488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reachability problem asks to decide if there exists a path from one vertex to another in a digraph. In a grid digraph, the vertices are the points of a two-dimensional square grid, and an edge can occur between a vertex and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors only.
  Asano and Doerr (CCCG'11) presented the first simultaneous time-space bound for reachability in grid digraphs by solving the problem in polynomial time and $O(n^{1/2 + \epsilon})$ space. In 2018, the space complexity was improved to $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ by Ashida and Nakagawa (SoCG'18).
  In this paper, we show that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that uses $O(n^{1/4 + \epsilon})$ space to solve the reachability problem in a grid digraph containing $n$ vertices. We define and construct a new separator-like device called pseudoseparator to develop a divide-and-conquer algorithm. This algorithm works in a space-efficient manner to solve reachability.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of the 3-majority opinion dynamics with noisy interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication noise is a common feature in several real-world scenarios where systems of agents need to communicate in order to pursue some collective task. In particular, many biologically inspired systems that try to achieve agreements on some opinion must implement resilient dynamics that are not strongly affected by noisy communications. In this work, we study the popular 3-Majority dynamics, an opinion dynamics which has been proved to be an efficient protocol for the majority consensus problem, in which we introduce a simple feature of uniform communication noise, following (d'Amore et al. 2020). We prove that in the fully connected communication network of n agents and in the binary opinion case, the process induced by the 3-Majority dynamics exhibits a phase transition. For a noise probability $p &lt; 1/3$, the dynamics reaches in logarithmic time an almost-consensus metastable phase which lasts for a polynomial number of rounds with high probability. Furthermore, departing from previous analyses, we further characterize this phase by showing that there exists an attractive equilibrium value $s_{\text{eq}} \in [n]$ for the bias of the system, i.e. the difference between the majority community size and the minority one. Moreover, the agreement opinion turns out to be the initial majority one if the bias towards it is of magnitude $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ in the initial configuration. If, instead, $p &gt; 1/3$, no form of consensus is possible, and any information regarding the initial majority opinion is lost in logarithmic time with high probability. Despite more communications per-round are allowed, the 3-Majority dynamics surprisingly turns out to be less resilient to noise than the Undecided-State dynamics (d'Amore et al. 2020), whose noise threshold value is $p = 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Fast Gradient Computation for RoPE Attention in Almost Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism has become a powerful enhancement to the Transformer architecture, which enables models to capture token relationships when encoding positional information. However, the RoPE mechanisms make the computations of attention mechanisms more complicated, which makes efficient algorithms challenging. Earlier research introduced almost linear time, i.e., $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens, algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings. However, achieving a subquadratic time algorithm for other parameter regimes remains impossible unless the widely accepted Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is disproven. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform. Furthermore, we show that with lower bounds derived from the SETH, the bounded entry condition is necessary for subquadratic performance.</description>
