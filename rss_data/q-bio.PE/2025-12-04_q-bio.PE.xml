      <title>Microclimatic variation in tropical canopies: A glimpse into the processes of community assembly in epiphytic bryophyte communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epiphytic communities offer an original framework to disentangle the contributions of environmental filters, biotic interactions and dispersal limitations to community structure at fine spatial scales. We determine here whether variations in light, microclimatic conditions and host tree size affect the variation in species composition and phylogenetic structure of epiphytic bryophyte communities, and hence, assess the contribution of environmental filtering, phylogenetic constraints and competition to community assembly.A canopy crane giving access to 1.1 ha of tropical rainforest in Yunnan (China) was employed to record hourly light and microclimatic conditions from 54 dataloggers and epiphytic bryophyte communities from 408 plots. Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling was implemented to analyse the relationship between taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover among epiphytic communities, host-tree characteristics and microclimatic variation.Within-tree vertical turnover of bryophyte communities was significantly about 30% higher than horizontal turnover among-trees. Thus, the sharp vertical variations in microclimatic conditions from tree base to canopy are more important than differences in age, reflecting the likelihood of colonization, area, and habitat conditions between young and old trees, in shaping the composition of epiphytic bryophyte communities.</description>

      <title>Generating a Contact Matrix for Aged Care Settings in Australia: an agent-based model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate staff and resident interactions within a synthetic aged care facility, capturing movement, task execution, and proximity-based contact events across three staff shifts and varying levels of resident care. Contacts were defined by spatial thresholds (1.5 m and 3 m) and cumulative duration, enabling the generation of detailed contact matrices. Simulation results showed that low and medium care residents experienced the highest frequency of interactions, particularly with staff on morning and afternoon shifts, while high care residents and night staff had substantially fewer contacts. Contact rates varied significantly by care level and shift, confirmed through Poisson-based regression modelling. Temporal analyses revealed clustering of high-risk contacts during structured daily routines, especially communal and care activities. An integrated airborne transmission module, seeded with a single infectious staff member, demonstrated that infection risk was highest during high-contact shifts and among medium care residents. Vaccination scenarios reduced predicted transmission by up to 68\%, with the greatest impact observed when both staff and residents were vaccinated. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for contact heterogeneity in aged care and demonstrate the utility of ABMs for evaluating targeted infection control strategies in high-risk, enclosed environments.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating growth rates link turnover and unevenness in species-rich communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maintenance of diversity, the `commonness of rarity', and compositional turnover are ubiquitous features of species-rich communities. Through a minimal model, we consider how these features reflect the interplay between environmental stochasticity, intra- and interspecific competition, and dispersal. We show that, even if species have the same time-average fitness, fluctuations tend to drive the community towards ever-growing unevenness and species extinctions, but self-limitation and/or dispersal allow species-rich states to be sustained. Species abundance--distributions vary systematically in a Buffering--Stabilization parameter plane that describes the relative strength of the underlying ecological processes, and cover different empirically relevant power-law and unimodal shapes. A model describing the effective dynamics of a focal species relates static abundance distributions with turnover dynamics, also when species have different mean fitness. The model suggests how community statistics and time series of individual species can inform on the relative importance of the ecological processes that structure diversity.</description>

      <title>Generalizing matrix representations to fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic tree shapes capture fundamental signatures of evolution. We consider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the internal nodes compatible with the tree graph. Recent work has established an elegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called \textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for isochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time, such as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals. Another important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of events is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree, called a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods. These trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B cells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a fully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total order. Here we extend the \textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of \textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix representation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly constrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of all valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic models on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial objects that have a rich history in the literature.</description>
