      <title>Storage places in diplomatic texts (7th-13th centuries). Lexical, semantic, and digital investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the evolution of references to grain storage structures in medieval European charters, based on a quantitative and semantic analysis of the digitized CEMA (Cartae Europae Medii Aevi) corpus comprising more than 225,000 documents. The author applies text mining and distributional analysis methods to a lexicon of some forty terms designating storage locations (grangia, horreum, granarium, granica, etc.), cross-referencing these data with references to grain and analyzing their semantic contexts over the long term. The analysis reveals a paradigm shift between the early Middle Ages (decentralized, loosely regulated storage) and the 12th-13th centuries (centralization of storage by the ruling classes). Granaries became instruments of spatial polarization and social control, contributing to the accentuation of social domination in medieval Europe. This evolution was accompanied by a new conceptualization of storage, both material and spiritual.</description>

      <title>Identifying Information Technology Research Trends through Text Mining of NSF Awards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Technology (IT) is recognized as an independent and unique research field. However, there has been ambiguity and difficulty in identifying and differentiating IT research from other close variations. Given this context, this paper aimed to explore the roots of the Information Technology (IT) research domain by conducting a large-scale text mining analysis of 50,780 abstracts from awarded NSF CISE grants from 1985 to 2024. We categorized the awards based on their program content, labeling human-centric programs as IT research programs and infrastructure-centric programs as other research programs based on the IT definitions in the literature. This novel approach helped us identify the core concepts of IT research and compare the similarities and differences between IT research and other research areas. The results showed that IT differentiates itself from other close variations by focusing more on the needs of users, organizations, and societies.</description>

      <title>Layout-Aware OCR for Black Digital Archives with Unsupervised Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their cultural and historical significance, Black digital archives continue to be a structurally underrepresented area in AI research and infrastructure. This is especially evident in efforts to digitize historical Black newspapers, where inconsistent typography, visual degradation, and limited annotated layout data hinder accurate transcription, despite the availability of various systems that claim to handle optical character recognition (OCR) well. In this short paper, we present a layout-aware OCR pipeline tailored for Black newspaper archives and introduce an unsupervised evaluation framework suited to low-resource archival contexts. Our approach integrates synthetic layout generation, model pretraining on augmented data, and a fusion of state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) detectors. We used three annotation-free evaluation metrics, the Semantic Coherence Score (SCS), Region Entropy (RE), and Textual Redundancy Score (TRS), which quantify linguistic fluency, informational diversity, and redundancy across OCR regions. Our evaluation on a 400-page dataset from ten Black newspaper titles demonstrates that layout-aware OCR improves structural diversity and reduces redundancy compared to full-page baselines, with modest trade-offs in coherence. Our results highlight the importance of respecting cultural layout logic in AI-driven document understanding and lay the foundation for future community-driven and ethically grounded archival AI systems.</description>

      <title>Automated Generation of Research Workflows from Academic Papers: A Full-text Mining Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science". However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive, structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772. Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of 0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel, process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving scientific paradigms.
