      <title>Linear reflected backward stochastic differential equations arising from vulnerable claims in markets with random horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the setting governed by $(\mathbb{F},\tau)$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is the "public" flow of information, and $\tau$ is a random time which might not be $\mathbb{F}$-observable. This framework covers credit risk theory and life insurance. In this setting, we assume $\mathbb{F}$ being generated by a Brownian motion $W$ and consider a vulnerable claim $\xi$, whose payment's policy depends {\it{essentially}} on the occurrence of $\tau$. The hedging problems, in many directions, for this claim led to the question of studying the linear reflected-backward-stochastic differential equations (RBSDE hereafter), \begin{equation*} \begin{split} &amp;dY_t=f(t)d(t\wedge\tau)+Z_tdW_{t\wedge{\tau}}+dM_t-dK_t,\quad Y_{\tau}=\xi,\\ &amp; Y\geq S\quad\mbox{on}\quad \Lbrack0,\tau\Lbrack,\quad \displaystyle\int_0^{\tau}(Y_{s-}-S_{s-})dK_s=0\quad P\mbox{-a.s.}.\end{split} \end{equation*} This is the objective of this paper. For this RBSDE and without any further assumption on $\tau$ that might neglect any risk intrinsic to its stochasticity, we answer the following: a) What are the sufficient minimal conditions on the data $(f, \xi, S, \tau)$ that guarantee the existence of the solution to this RBSDE? b) How can we estimate the solution in norm using $(f, \xi, S)$? c) Is there an $\mathbb F$-RBSDE that is intimately related to the current one and how their solutions are related to each other? This latter question has practical and theoretical leitmotivs.</description>

      <title>Endogenous distress contagion in a dynamic interbank model: how possible future losses may spell doom today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic and stochastic interbank model with an endogenous notion of distress contagion, arising from rational worries about future defaults and ensuing losses. This entails a mark-to-market valuation adjustment for interbank claims, leading to a forward-backward approach to the equilibrium dynamics whereby future default probabilities are needed to determine today's balance sheets. Distinct from earlier models, the resulting distress contagion acts, endogenously, as a stochastic volatility term that exhibits clustering and down-market spikes. Furthermore, by incorporating multiple maturities, we provide a novel framework for constructing systemic interbank term structures, reflecting the intertemporal risk of contagion. We present the analysis in two parts: first, the simpler single maturity setting that extends the classical interbank network literature and, then, the multiple maturity setting for which we can examine how systemic risk materialises in the shape of the resulting term structures.</description>

      <title>Joint calibration to SPX and VIX Derivative Markets with Composite Change of Time Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is calculated from SPX options and derivatives of VIX are also traded in market, which leads to the so-called "consistent modeling" problem. This paper proposes a time-changed L\'evy model for log price with a composite change of time structure to capture both features of the implied SPX volatility and the implied volatility of volatility. Consistent modeling is achieved naturally via flexible choices of jumps and leverage effects, as well as the composition of time changes. Many celebrated models are covered as special cases. From this model, we derive an explicit form of the characteristic function for the asset price (SPX) and the pricing formula for European options as well as VIX options. The empirical results indicate great competence of the proposed model in the problem of joint calibration of the SPX/VIX Markets.</description>

      <title>Monotonic mean-deviation risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean-deviation models, along with the existing theory of coherent risk measures, are well studied in the literature. In this paper, we characterize monotonic mean-deviation (risk) measures from a general mean-deviation model by applying a risk-weighting function to the deviation part. The form is a combination of the deviation-related functional and the expectation, and such measures belong to the class of consistent risk measures. The monotonic mean-deviation measures admit an axiomatic foundation via preference relations. By further assuming the convexity and linearity of the risk-weighting function, the characterizations for convex and coherent risk measures are obtained, giving rise to many new explicit examples of convex and nonconvex consistent risk measures. Further, we specialize in the convex case of the monotonic mean-deviation measure and obtain its dual representation. The worst-case values of the monotonic mean-deviation measures are analyzed under two popular settings of model uncertainty. Further, we establish asymptotic consistency and normality of the natural estimators of the monotonic mean-deviation measures.Finally, the monotonic mean-deviation measures are applied to a problem of portfolio selection using financial data.</description>

      <title>Optimal market-neutral currency trading on the cryptocurrency platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15461v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach in multivariate pair trading, termed the Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We present a method for selectively forming a "bucket" of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities simultaneously. To address quantitative conflicts from multiple trading signals, a novel bi-objective convex optimization formulation is designed to balance investor preferences between profitability and risk tolerance. We understand that cryptocurrencies carry significant financial risks. Therefore this process includes tunable parameters such as volatility penalties and action thresholds. In experiments conducted in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022, which encompassed a vigorous bull run followed by a bear run, the OTT achieved an annualized profit of 15.49%. Additionally, supplementary experiments detailed in the appendix extend the applicability of OTT to other major cryptocurrencies in the post-COVID period, validating the model's robustness and effectiveness in various market conditions. The arbitrage operation offers a new perspective on trading, without requiring external shorting or holding the intermediate during the arbitrage period. As a note of caution, this study acknowledges the high-risk nature of cryptocurrency investments, which can be subject to significant volatility and potential loss.</description>
