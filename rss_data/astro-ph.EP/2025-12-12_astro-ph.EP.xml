      <title>Validation of a Third Earth-sized Planet in the TOI-2267 Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the validation of a third terrestrial exoplanet in the nearby (22 pc) TOI-2267 system. TOI-2267 is a binary system with stellar components TOI-2267A (M5, 3030 K) and TOI-2267B (M6, 2930 K), with an on-sky separation of 0.$^{\prime\prime}$384 (8 au projected separation). TOI-2267 hosts two Earth-sized planets (TOI-2267 b, $1.00\pm0.11 R_{\oplus}$, and TOI-2267 c, $1.14\pm0.13 R_{\oplus}$, if orbiting the primary star; or $1.22\pm0.29 R_{\oplus}$ and $1.36\pm0.33 R_{\oplus}$, respectively, if orbiting the secondary star) with orbital periods of 2.3 and 3.5 days. This system also contains a third Earth-sized planet candidate with an orbital period of 2.0 days that was previously identified as a likely planet with a low false-positive probability, but could not be firmly validated due to the lack of independent observations beyond TESS data. We combine two new transit observations from the 5.1m Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory with archival TESS data and high-resolution imaging to statistically validate the planetary nature of TOI-2267 d ($0.98\pm0.09 R_{\oplus}$ if orbiting the primary star, or $1.77\pm0.43 R_{\oplus}$ if orbiting the secondary star) using the updated TRICERATOPS+ pipeline. We attempt to determine the host star for TOI-2267 d using transit shape stellar density analysis, but are unable to conclusively assign a host. Our validation of TOI-2267 d suggests that TOI-2267 is either the first known double transiting M dwarf binary system, or hosts three planets in an extremely compact orbital configuration.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Atmospheric Biosignatures in Earth Analogs with Varying Surface Boundary Conditions: Prospects for Characterization in the UV, Visible, Near-Infrared, and Mid-Infrared Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for potentially habitable exoplanets centers on detecting biosignature molecules in Earth-like atmospheres, which makes it essential to understand their detectability under biologically and geologically influenced conditions. In this study, we model the reflection and thermal emission spectra of such atmospheres across the UV/VIS/NIR and mid-IR regions and simulate their detectability with future mission concepts such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). We employ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model data, based on Earth's atmosphere, to derive temperature pressure profiles and couple them with a 1D photochemical model to assess the detectability of these molecules in Earth analogs located 10 parsecs away. We investigate the dominant reaction pathways and their contributions to the atmospheric composition of an Earth analog, with a focus on how they shape the resulting molecular signatures. We also examine the role of surface boundary conditions, which indirectly trace the effects of biological and geological processes, on the detectability of these molecules using HWO- and LIFE-type mission concepts. Our findings indicate that O3 is detectable with both mission concepts, while H2O requires specific surface humidity levels for detection with LIFE and shows only potential detectability with HWO. CO2 is detectable with LIFE. Both N2O and CH4 require continuous surface outgassing for potential detection with LIFE, and CH4 further requires low surface humidity to prevent masking by water features. Our work highlights the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of Earth analogs in the UV/VIS/NIR and mid-IR domains using HWO- and LIFE-type mission concepts and offers guidance for the development of future missions operating in these spectral regions.</description>

      <title>An analytical framework for atmospheric tides on rocky planets. I. Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric thermal tides arise from the diurnal contrast in stellar irradiation. They exert a significant influence on the long-term rotational evolution of rocky planets because they can accelerate the planetary spin, thereby counteracting the decelerating effect of classical gravitational tides. Consequently, equilibrium tide-locked states may emerge, as exemplified by Venus and hypothesised for Precambrian Earth. Quantifying the atmospheric thermal torque and elucidating its dependence on tidal frequency -- both in the low- and high-frequency regimes -- is therefore essential. In particular, we focus here on the resonance that affected early Earth, which is associated with a forced Lamb wave. Within the framework of linear theory, we develop a new analytical model of the atmospheric response to both gravitational an thermal tidal forcings for two representative vertical temperature profiles that bracket the atmospheres of rocky planets: (i) an isothermal profile (uniform temperature) and (ii) an isentropic profile (uniform potential temperature). Dissipative processes are incorporated via Newtonian cooling. We demonstrate that the isothermal and isentropic cases are governed by the same general closed-form solution, and we derive explicit expressions for the three-dimensional tidal fields (pressure, temperature, density and wind velocities) throughout the spherical atmospheric shell. These results constitute the foundation for two forthcoming papers, in which analytical formulae for the thermotidal torque will be presented and compared with numerical solutions obtained from General Circulation Models (GCMs).</description>

      <title>A "New Hope" for Moon Formation: Presenting a Multiple Impact Pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading hypothesis for the origin of the Moon, that of a single giant impact, faces significant challenges. These include either the need for an impactor with a near-identical composition to Earth or an extremely high-mass or high-energy impact to achieve near-complete material mixing. In this paper we explore an alternative, the "multiple impact hypothesis", which relaxes the compositional constraints on both the target and projectile, and allows for the consideration of more probable, less extreme impacts that steadily grow the Earth and Moon to their current size over several impact events. Using the hydrodynamical code SWIFT, we simulate "chains" of impacts and follow the growth of a moon around a planet analogous to our own. Our results demonstrate that chains of three or more impacts can produce systems comparable to the Earth-Moon system whilst achieving higher compositional similarities than the canonical giant impact scenario. This presents the multiple impact hypothesis as a promising alternative to the single large impact scenario for the origin of the Moon.</description>

      <title>Diversity in the haziness and chemistry of temperate sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent transit observations of K2-18b and TOI-270d revealed strong molecular absorption signatures, lending credence to the idea that temperate sub-Neptunes (T$_\mathrm{eq}$=250-400K) have upper atmospheres mostly free of aerosols. These observations also indicated higher-than-expected CO$_2$ abundances on both planets, implying bulk compositions with high water mass fractions. However, it remains unclear whether these findings hold true for all temperate sub-Neptunes. Here, we present the JWST NIRSpec/PRISM 0.7-5.4$\mathbf{\mu}$m transmission spectrum of a third temperate sub-Neptune, the 2.4R$_\oplus$ planet LP 791-18c (T$_\mathrm{eq}$=355K), which is even more favorable for atmospheric characterization thanks to its small M6 host star. Intriguingly, despite LP 791-18c's radius, mass, and equilibrium temperature being in between those of K2-18b and TOI-270d, we find a drastically different transmission spectrum. While we also detect methane on LP 791-18c, its transit spectrum is dominated by strong haze scattering and there is no discernible CO$_2$ absorption. Overall, we infer a deep metal-enriched atmosphere (246-415$\times$solar) for LP 791-18c, with a CO$_2$-to-CH$_4$ ratio smaller than 0.07 (at 2$\sigma$), indicating less H$_2$O in the deep envelope of LP 791-18c and implying a relatively dry formation inside the water ice-line. These results show that sub-Neptunes that are near-analogues in density and temperature can show drastically different aerosols and envelope chemistry, and are intrinsically diverse beyond a simple temperature dependence.</description>

      <title>Impact of geometry on 1D molecular-kinetics simulations of acoustic-gravity wave propagation into the exosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) calculations of acoustic gravity wave propagation into the exobase region of a Mars-like atmosphere reveal that radial geometry can reduce wave-driven heating compared to a Cartesian model. We examine two acoustic wave (AW) modes with periods of 11 minutes (AW1) and 5.5 minutes (AW2) propagating from 100 to 320 km altitude using a radial molecular kinetics model. The wave-driven heating was reduced by 40-56% with cycle-averaged temperature gradient $\langle dT/dr \rangle$ decreasing from 9.4 K per scale height H0 to 5.6 K/H$_0$ for AW1 and from 4.4 K/H$_0$ to 1.9 K/H$_0$ for AW2 when accounting for planetary curvature. While the growth in wave density amplitude was attenuated for the 1D radial geometry as well, the heating differences are more pronounced, with both effects driven by geometric spreading accumulating as waves propagate into increasingly rarefied regions. These findings suggest that accounting for curvature effects is crucial when conducting DSMC estimates of acoustic wave contributions to thermospheric heating and atmospheric escape, as Cartesian-based derived counterparts may be overestimated by factors of 1.7-2.3 for these frequencies.</description>

      <title>A Stellar Magnesium to Silicon ratio in the atmosphere of an exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elemental compositions of exoplanets encode information about their formation environments and internal structures. While volatile ratios such as carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) are used to trace formation location, the rock-forming elements - magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) - govern interior mineralogy and are commonly assumed to reflect the host star's abundances. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Ultra-hot Jupiters, gas-giant exoplanets with dayside temperatures above 3000 K, provide rare access to refractory elements that remain gaseous. Here we present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-189b (Teq = 3354^{+27}_{-34} K) obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on Gemini South. We detect neutral iron (Fe I), magnesium (Mg I), silicon (Si I), water (H_2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydroxyl (OH) at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 4, and retrieve their elemental abundances. We show that the Mg/Si, Fe/Mg, and Si/Fe ratios are consistent with stellar values, while the refractory-to-volatile ratio is enhanced by roughly a factor of ~2. These findings demonstrate that giant-planet atmospheres can preserve stellar-like rock-forming ratios, providing an empirical validation of the stellar-proxy assumption that underpins planetary composition and formation models across exoplanet systems.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Large Space-Based Telescopes: Modeling Stray Light due to Primary Mirror Damage from Micrometeoroid Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large space-based telescope aimed at detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like stars will require unprecedented contrast and stability. However, damage to the primary mirror due to micrometeoroid impacts will provide a stochastic, time-dependent source of stray light in the coronagraph's field of view that could significantly lengthen exposure times and reduce the expected science yield. To better quantify the impact of stray light and inform the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission design process, we present estimates of stray light in different micrometeoroid damage scenarios for a broad range of targets, and use that to find the expected decrease in science yield (i.e., the expected number of detected exoEarth candidates). We find that stray light due to micrometeoroid damage may significantly reduce yield, by 30% -- 60% in some cases, but significant uncertainties remain due to the unknown maximum expected impactor energy, and the relationship between impact energy and expected crater size. Micrometeoroid damage therefore needs further exploration, as it has the potential to reduce scientific yield, and in turn drive the development of mitigation strategies, selection of telescope designs, and selection of observing priorities in the future.</description>

      <title>The Space-Based Time-Domain Revolution in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based time-domain telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler/K2 and TESS have profoundly impacted astrophysics over the past two decades. Continuous light curves with high cadence and high photometric precision are now available for millions of sources within our galaxy and beyond. In addition to revolutionizing exoplanet science, the data have enabled breakthroughs ranging from the solar system to stellar interiors, the transient universe, and active galaxies. The key summary points of this review are: (1) Stellar astrophysics has been transformed by the ability to probe the internal structures of stars, test the physics of stellar convection, connect stellar rotation and magnetic activity, and reveal complex variability in young stars. (2) Ages of stellar populations probe the formation history of our Milky Way, and binary star variability enables the detection of "dark" galactic populations such as solar-mass black holes and neutron stars. (3) Early-time observations of explosive transients provide new insights into the progenitors of supernovae, while the quasi-periodic variability of galaxies probes the physics of accretion processes onto supermassive black holes and the tidal disruption of stars. (4) Observations of solar system objects reveal asteroid compositions through their rotation periods and amplitudes, constrain the cloud structure of ice giants, and allow the discovery of new objects in the outer solar system. (5) Open data policies and software have contributed to remarkable scientific productivity and enabled discoveries by citizen scientists, including new exoplanets and exotic variability in mature Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>High-energy astrochemistry in the molecular interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</description>

      <title>Hipparcos, Gaia, and RVs reveal that the radio emitting F star HD 220242 has an M dwarf companion, a likely source of the radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of circularly polarized, low frequency radio emission offers the tantalizing possibility of the observation of interactions between stars and their possible substellar companions, as well as direct emission from exoplanets. Additional follow up of systems with radio emission is key to understanding the true origin of the emission, since multiple astrophysical mechanisms can plausibly lead to such signals. While nineteen M dwarfs were detected by LOFAR in circular polarization as part of the V-LoTSS survey, HD~220242 is the only F star to have a circularly polarized low frequency radio detection in the same survey. We conducted radial velocity follow up with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and combined these observations with additional archival RVs and \textit{Hipparcos}-\textit{Gaia} proper motion accelerations to determine that HD~220242 has a stellar companion with P=16.79$\pm$0.04\,yrs and a mass of $0.619\pm0.014$\,M$_\odot$. We use Spectral Energy Distribution fitting and lack of any UV excess to rule out a co-evolved white dwarf companion and confirm that the companion is an M dwarf star. Given that F stars lack the coronal properties to produce such coherent emission, and the companion mass and lack of UV excess are consistent with an M dwarf, the radio emission is most plausibly associated with the companion.</description>

Abstract: Venus, in the absence of an intrinsic magnetic field, undergoes a direct interaction between its ionosphere and the solar wind. Previous missions, including Mariner, Venera, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), reported a recurring localized increase in electron density, often termed a "bulge," at altitudes between 160 and 200 km. This study investigates this topside bulge using over 200 dayside electron density profiles derived from the Venus Radio Science experiment (VeRa) onboard the Venus Express (VEX). We employ an automated, gradient-based classification algorithm to provide a quantitative and reproducible method for identifying and categorizing the bulge morphology into three types. Type 1 profiles exhibit a distinct secondary peak above the main V2 layer. Type 2 profiles display a shoulder-like feature near the bulge altitude. Type 3 bulges are not visually apparent but can be identified through residuals obtained after subtracting a Chapman layer fit to the V2 peak. The bulge is detected in over 80\% of the analyzed profiles, with a higher occurrence during periods of low solar activity and at lower solar zenith angles (SZA). Type 1 morphologies are only observed at low latitudes (within $\pm 40^\circ$). The peak altitude of the bulge negatively correlates with SZA, suggesting that thermospheric cooling toward the terminator significantly influences the bulge altitude. The occurrence patterns and morphological characteristics indicate that the bulge is likely influenced by external drivers, such as solar wind interaction, rather than being solely a result of local photochemical processes.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXX: Dust enhancement in the young binary L1551 IRS 5</title>

Abstract: Young binary stars with discs provide unique laboratories to study the earliest stages of planet formation in star-forming environments. The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($&lt;1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions.</description>

      <title>Retrograde predominance of small saturnian moons reiterates a recent retrograde collisional disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery and careful orbital determination of 64 new irregular moons of Saturn found in images taken using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from 2019-2021, bringing the total number of saturnian irregulars to 122. By more than doubling the sample of saturnian irregular moon orbits, including pushing to smaller sizes, we can now see finer detail in their orbital distribution. We note the emergence of potential subgroups associated with each of Siarnaq and Kiviuq within the Inuit group.
  We find that in the inclination range 157-172 degrees the ratio of smaller moons (diameters less than 4 km) to larger moons (diameters greater than 4 km) is significantly larger than that of any other inclination range in the retrogrades. We denote this subset of the Norse group as the Mundilfari subgroup after its largest member. The incredibly steep slope of the Mundilfari subgroup's size distribution, with a differential power law index of q = 6, strengthens the hypothesis in Ashton et al. (2021) that this subgroup was created by a recent catastrophic collision, $&lt;10^8$ yr ago.</description>

      <title>On the Exoplanet Yield of Gaia Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine the expected yield of Gaia astrometric planet detections using updated models for giant-planet occurrence, the local stellar population, and Gaia's demonstrated astrometric precision. Our analysis combines a semi-analytic model that clarifies key scaling relations with more realistic Monte Carlo simulations. We predict $7{,}500 \pm 2{,}100$ planet discoveries in the 5-year dataset (DR4) and $120{,}000 \pm 22{,}000$ over the full 10-year mission (DR5), with the dominant error arising from uncertainties in giant-planet occurrence. We evaluate the sensitivity of these forecasts to the detection threshold and the desired precision for measurements of planet masses and orbital parameters. Roughly $1{,}900 \pm 540$ planets in DR4 and $38{,}000 \pm 7{,}300$ planets in DR5 should have masses and orbital periods determined to better than $20$%. Most detections will be super-Jupiters ($3$ - $13 M_{\rm J}$) on $2$ - $5$AU orbits around GKM-type stars ($0.4$ - $1.3 M_\odot$) within $500$ pc. Unresolved binary stars will lead to spurious planet detections, but we estimate that genuine planets will outnumber them by a factor of $5$ or more. An exception is planets around M-dwarfs with $a &lt; 1$AU, for which the false-positive rate is expected to be about $50$%. To support community preparation for upcoming data releases, we provide mock catalogs of Gaia exoplanets and planet-impostor binaries.</description>

      <title>Finite Lifetime Fragment Model 4 for Striae Formation in the Dust Tails of Comets (FLM 4) Acceleration by Lorenz-force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The striations in the dust tails of comets are referred to as striae, and their origin has long been a mystery. We introduce a new dynamic model to describe the forms of the striae observed in comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), West (C/1975 V1), and Seki-Lines (C/1962 C1). Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5micrometer, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.</description>

      <title>A Markov Decision Process Framework for Early Maneuver Decisions in Satellite Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to autonomously make guidance decisions for satellite collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to enable direct optimization of guidance policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average propellant consumption of CAMs by making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when to initiate the maneuver. The MDP models decision rewards using analytical models of collision risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. By deciding to maneuver earlier than conventional methods, the Markov policy effectively favors CAMs that achieve comparable rates of collision risk reduction while consuming less propellant. Using historical data of tracked conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive parameter-sensitivity study. When evaluated on synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy consumes significantly less propellant overall and per maneuver in comparison to a conventional cut-off policy that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant overall but consumes less propellant per maneuver. For both historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy is slightly more conservative in identifying conjunctions events that warrant CAMs in comparison to cutoff policies.</description>
