      <title>Harnessing quantum light for microscopic biomechanical imaging of cells and tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photo-damage and photo-bleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photo-damage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling non-destructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this novel methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photo-damage and photo-bleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for a new era of research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to high-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>

      <title>Qualitatively Distinct Signaling in Cells: The Informational Landscape of Amplitude and Frequency Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells continuously sense their surroundings to detect modifications and generate responses. Very often changes in extracellular concentrations initiate signaling cascades that eventually result in changes in gene expression. Increasing stimulus strengths can be encoded in increasing concentration amplitudes or increasing activation frequencies of intermediaries of the pathway. In this paper we show that the different way in which amplitude and frequency encoding map environmental changes endow cells with qualitatively different information transmission capabilities. While amplitude encoding is optimal for a limited range of stimuli strengths, frequency encoding can transmit information with equal reliability over much broader ranges. The qualitative difference between the two strategies stems from the scale invariant discriminating power of the first transducing step in frequency codification. The apparently redundant combination of both strategies in some cell types may then serve the purpose of expanding the span over which stimulus strengths can be reliably discriminated. In this paper we discuss a possible example of this mechanism in yeast.</description>
