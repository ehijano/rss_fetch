      <title>Concentration of mean exit times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean exit time function defined on the $\delta$-tube around any equator $\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \subseteq \mathbb{S}^{n}$ of the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n}$, ($0&lt;\delta&lt;\pi/2$), goes to infinity with the dimension, so that when we consider a Brownian particle that begins its motion at one equator of the sphere, this particle will remain near this equator for an almost infinite amount of time when the dimension of the sphere goes to infinity. On the other hand, if the Brownian particle begins its motion at the North pole, then this particle will leave quickly, when the dimension of the sphere goes to infinity, any geodesic ball with radius $\delta &lt;\pi/2$, centered at this point. Namely, the mean exit time function defined on the equatorial tubes presents a kind of {\em concentration} phenomenon or {\em fat equator} effect, as it has been described in the book \cite{MS}.
  Moreover, the same concentration phenomenon occurs when we consider this mean exit time function defined on tubes around closed and minimal hypersurfaces of a compact Riemannian $n$-manifold $M$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below, ${\rm Ric}_{M}\geq (n-1)$. Namely, a Brownian particle that begins its random movement around a closed embedded minimal hypersurface of a compact $n$-manifold $M$ with ${\rm Ric}_{M}\geq (n-1)$ will wanders arbitrarily close to the hypersurface for a time that approaches infinity as the dimension of the ambient manifold does so as well.</description>

      <title>Computer-assisted construction of $SU(2)$-invariant negative Einstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a 2-parameter family of new triaxial $SU(2)$-invariant complete negative Einstein metrics on the complex line bundle $\mathcal{O}(-4)$ over $\mathbb{C}P^1$. The metrics are conformally compact and generically neither K\"ahler nor self-dual. The proof involves using rigorous numerics to produce an approximate Einstein metric to high precision in a bounded region containing the singular orbit or "bolt", which is then perturbed to a genuine Einstein metric using fixed-point methods. At the boundary of this region, the latter metric is sufficiently close to hyperbolic space for us to show that it indeed extends to a complete, asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein metric.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Lorentzian quasi-Fuchsian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional quasi-Fuchsian Lorentzian manifold $M$ is a globally hyperbolic spacetime diffeomorphic to $\Sigma\times (-1,1)$ for a closed orientable surface $\Sigma$ of genus $\geq 2$. It is the quotient $M=\Gamma\backslash \Omega_\Gamma$ of an open set $\Omega_\Gamma\subset {\rm AdS}_3$ by a discrete group $\Gamma$ of isometries of ${\rm AdS}_3$ which is a particular example of an Anosov representation of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$. We first show that the spacelike geodesic flow of $M$ is Axiom A, has a discrete Ruelle resonance spectrum with associated (co-)resonant states, and that the Poincar\'e series for $\Gamma$ extend meromorphically to $\mathbb{C}$. This is then used to prove that there is a natural notion of resolvent of the pseudo-Riemannian Laplacian $\Box$ of $M$, which is meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ with poles of finite rank, defining a notion of quantum resonances and quantum resonant states related to the Ruelle resonances and (co-)resonant states by a quantum-classical correspondence. This initiates the spectral study of convex co-compact pseudo-Riemannian locally symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Dirac structures in nonholonomic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a Dirac algebroid, which is a linear almost Dirac structure on a vector bundle, was designed to generate phase equations for mechanical systems with linear nonholonomic constraints. We apply it to systems with magnetic-like or gyroscopic potentials, that were previously described by means of almost Poisson structures. The almost Poisson structures present in the literature in this context were constructed using constraints, metrics and information about magnetic or gyroscopic potential present in the Hamiltonian function of the system. The Dirac algebroid we use is constructed out of constraints and canonical geometric structures of the underlying bundles and is universal in the sense that it is independent on the particular Hamiltonian or Lagrangian. We provide examples showing that using the same Dirac structure we can describe systems with different potentials, magnetic or mechanical, added freely to a function generating the dynamics.</description>

      <title>A decomposition lemma in convex integration via classical algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decomposition lemma that allows error terms to be expressed using fewer primitive matrices than $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ within the convex integration scheme of constructing flexible $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions to a system of nonlinear PDEs in dimension $n\geq 2$, which can be viewed as a kind of truncation of the codimension one local isometric embedding equation in Nash-Kuiper Theorem. This leads to flexible solutions with higher H\"older regularity, and consequently, improved very weak solutions to certain induced equations for any $n$, including Monge-Amp\`ere systems and $2$-Hessian systems. The H\"older exponent of the solutions can be taken as any $\alpha &lt;(n^2+1)^{-1}$ for $n=2,4,8,16$, and any $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n-2\rho(\frac{n}{2})-1)^{-1}$ for other $n$, thereby improving the previously known bound $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n+1)^{-1}$ for $n\geq 3$. Here, $\rho(n)$ is the Radon-Hurwitz number, which exhibits an $8$-fold periodicity on $n$ that is related to Bott periodicity.
  Our arguments involve novel applications of several results from algebraic geometry and topology, including Adams' theorem on maximum linearly independent vector fields on spheres, the intersection of projective varieties, and projective duality. We also use an elliptic method ingeniously that avoids loss of differentiability.</description>

      <title>K-moduli of quasimaps and quasi-projectivity of moduli of K-stable Calabi-Yau fibrations over curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a projective K-moduli space of quasimaps with a certain log Fano condition.
  Moreover, we investigate relationships between the K-moduli of quasimaps and the K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations over curves of negative Kodaira dimension constructed by the authors [HaHa23] when general fibers are Abelian varieties or irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds.
  We show that there is a quasi-finite morphism from the K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations to the K-moduli of quasimaps and the CM line bundle of the K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations converges to the CM line bundle of the K-moduli of quasimaps.
  As a corollary, we obtain the entire quasi-projectivity of K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations in this case.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of anisotropic stiffness tensors from partial data around one polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inverse problems in anisotropic elasticity using tools from algebraic geometry. The singularities of solutions to the elastic wave equation in dimension $n$ with an anisotropic stiffness tensor have propagation kinematics captured by so-called slowness surfaces, which are hypersurfaces in the cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that turn out to be algebraic varieties. Leveraging the algebraic geometry of families of slowness surfaces we show that, for tensors in a dense open subset in a space of anisotropic two-dimensional stiffness tensors, a small amount of data around one polarization in an individual slowness surface uniquely determines the entire slowness surface and its stiffness tensor. In three dimensions, for generic orthorhombic and monoclinic stiffness tensors, a small number of anomalous companions give rise to the same slowness surface; nevertheless, we conjecture that in the most anisotropic setting (triclinic) the tensor is unique, as in two dimensions. The partial data needed to determine a tensor arises naturally from seismological measurements or geometrized versions of seismic inverse problems. Additionally, we explain how the reconstruction of the stiffness tensor can be carried out effectively, using Gr\"obner bases. Our uniqueness or finiteness results fail for symmetric materials (e.g., fully isotropic), evidencing the counterintuitive claim that inverse problems in elasticity can become more tractable with increasing asymmetry.</description>

      <title>No compact split limit Ricci flow of type II from the blow-down</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By Perelman's $\mathcal L$-geodesic theory, we study the blow-down solutions on a noncompact $\kappa$-noncollapsed steady gradient Ricci soliton $(M^n, g)$ $(n\ge 4)$ with nonnegative curvature operator and positive Ricci curvature away from a compact set of $M$. We prove that any compact split ancient solution of codimension one from the blow-down of $(M, g)$ is of type I. The result is a generalization of our previous work from $n=4$ to any dimension.</description>

Abstract: Given an area-minimizing integral $m$-current in $\Sigma$, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the interior singular set of $T$ cannot exceed $m-2$, provided that $\Sigma$ is an embedded $(m+\bar{n})$-submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ of class $C^{2,\alpha}$, where $\alpha&gt;0$. This result establishes the complete counterpart, in the arbitrary codimension setting, of the interior regularity theory for area-minimizing integral hypercurrents within a Riemannian manifold of class $C^{2,\alpha}$.</description>

As a consequence, we prove K-stability of a large class of quasi-smooth Fano hypersurfaces of index 1 and of all smooth Fano weighted hypersurfaces of index 1 and 2. The proofs are based on the Abban--Zhuang method and on the study of linear systems on flags of weighted hypersurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the geometry of connected totally geodesic compact null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds is only slightly more specialized than that of Riemannian flows over compact manifolds, the latter mathematical theory having been much studied in the context of foliation theory since the work by Reinhart (Ann Math 69:119, 1959). We are then able to import results on Riemannian flows to the horizon case, so obtaining theorems on the dynamical structure of compact horizons that do not rely on (non-)degeneracy assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between isometric/geodesible Riemannian flows and non-degeneracy conditions. This work also contains some positive results on the possibility of finding, in the degenerate case, lightlike fields tangent to the horizon that have zero surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Pointwise dispersive estimates for Schrodinger and wave equations in a conical singular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pointwise decay estimates for the Schr\"odinger and wave equations on a product cone $(X,g)$, where the metric $g=dr^2+r^2 h$ and $X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)\times Y$ is a product cone over the closed Riemannian manifold $(Y,h)$ with metric $h$. Under the assumption that the conjugate radius $\epsilon$ of $Y$ satisfies $\epsilon&gt;\pi$, we prove the pointwise dispersive estimates for the Schr\"odinger and half-wave propagator in this setting. The key ingredient is the modified Hadamard parametrix on $Y$ in which the role of the conjugate points does not come to play if $\epsilon&gt;\pi$. In a work in progress, we will further study the case that $\epsilon\leq\pi$ in which the role of conjugate points come. A new finding is that a threshold of the conjugate radius of $Y$ for $L^p$-estimates in this setting is the magical number $\pi$.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problem for symmetric hyperbolic Partial Differential Operators on Complete Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a complete Riemannian manifold, as well as time independent smooth lower order terms appearing in a first order symmetric perturbation of a Riemannian wave operator can be uniquely recovered, up to the natural obstructions, from a local source to solution map of the respective hyperbolic initial value problem. Our proofs are based on an adaptation of the classical Boundary Control method (BC-method) originally developed by Belishev and Kurylev. The BC-method reduces the PDE-based problem to a purely geometric problem involving the so-called travel time data. For each point in the manifold the travel time data contains the distance function from this point to any point in a fixed \textit{a priori} known compact observation set. It is well known that this geometric problem is solvable. The main novelty of this paper lies in our strategy to recover the lower order terms via a further adaptation of the BC-method.</description>

      <title>Fourier and Helgason Fourier transforms for Vector Bundle-valued Differential Forms on Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the perspective of the functional equation satisfied by the classical Fourier transform to derive the Helgason Fourier transform map $\Omega^{l}(G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,V[\chi]):f\longmapsto \widehat{f}:G/K\times G/P\mapsto V[\chi]:(x,b)\longmapsto\widehat{f}(x,b)$ (for $W-$valued differential forms $f\in \Omega^{l}(G/K,W)$) as the $G-$ invariant vector bundle-valued differential form $\widehat{f}$ on the product space $G/K\times G/P$ whose image under the vector bundle-valued Poisson transform is the fibre convolution-integral $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}* f$ on $G/K,$ where $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}$ is the $W-$valued $\tau-$spherical $l-$form on $G/K.$ Explicitly, we prove that $$\widehat{f}_{l,k,\varepsilon(\lambda)}(x,b)=({\bf C_{o}\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}(\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\lambda,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x),$$ where $b\in G/P$ is a consequence of the boundary map $\beta^{V}(\lambda),$ ${\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}$ is the vector bundle-valued Harish-Chandra $c-$function and for some $\lambda-$linear relation, $\varepsilon(\lambda).$ The Fourier transform is found to be the map $\Omega^{l}G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,W)$ $:f\mapsto f^{\triangle}:$ $G/P\times G/K\longrightarrow W$ $:(b,x)\longmapsto f^{\triangle}(b,x)$ and is then established to be explicitly given as $f^{\triangle}_{l,k,\upsilon(\lambda)}(b,x)=$ $$\int_{G/P}\phi_{k,l,\lambda}\wedge\pi^{*}_{P}(({\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\lambda,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x)),$$ where $\upsilon(\lambda)$ is some $\lambda-$linear relation.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations are widely used to model irreversible processes in complex systems in physics. Recently, it has been studied that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We refer to these manifolds as finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations in probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, as well as Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a simplex set with a three-point lattice.</description>
