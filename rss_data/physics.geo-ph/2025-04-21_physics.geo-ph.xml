      <title>Learning the nature of viscoelasticity in geologic materials with MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rock and ice are ubiquitous geologic materials. While apparently solid, they also exhibit fluid behavior under stress - a property termed viscoelasticity. Viscoelastic convection of Earth's mantle drives tectonic plate motion with consequences for earthquakes and sea-level rise, while viscoelastic deformation of ice controls glacier flow and the flexure of icy moons. For crystalline materials, "flow laws" describing bulk rheology can be derived from understanding microstructural dynamics such as crystal-defect migration. Common geologic materials like ice and olivine have grain sizes and crystal orientations that evolve with strain; this complexity precludes a first principles approach. Here we use a Bayesian inference method to learn the connection between microstructure and flow in ice and olivine, from fits to experimental data of these materials undergoing steady-state deformation and forced oscillations. We demonstrate that this method can constrain a nonlinear viscoelastic model for each material, that is capable of capturing both steady and transient dynamics and can also predict dynamics for data it was not trained on. Our results may improve geodynamic models that rely on parameterized constitutive equations, while our approach will be useful for experimental design and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-aware rock physics enhanced digital shadow for underground-energy storage monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground energy storage, which includes storage of hydrogen, compressed air, and CO2, requires careful monitoring to track potential leakage pathways, a situation where time-lapse seismic imaging alone may be inadequate. A recently developed Digital Shadow (DS) enhances forecasting using machine learning and Bayesian inference, yet their accuracy depends on assumed rock physics models, the mismatch of which can lead to unreliable predictions for the reservoir's state (saturation/pressure). Augmenting DS training with multiple rock physics models mitigates errors but averages over uncertainties, obscuring their sources. To address this challenge, we introduce context-aware sensitivity analysis inspired by amortized Bayesian inference, allowing the DS to learn explicit dependencies between seismic data, the reservoir state, e.g., CO2 saturation, and rock physics models. At inference time, this approach allows for real-time ''what if'' scenario testing rather than relying on costly retraining, thereby enhancing interpretability and decision-making for safer, more reliable underground storage.</description>

      <title>Estimating Soil Electrical Parameters in the Canadian High Arctic from Impedance Measurements of the MIST Antenna Above the Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the bulk soil electrical conductivity and relative permittivity at a site in the Canadian High Arctic (79.37980 degrees N, 90.99885 degrees W). The soil parameters are determined using impedance measurements of a dipole antenna mounted horizontally 52 cm above the surface. The antenna is part of the Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST) radio cosmology experiment. The measurements were conducted on July 17-28, 2022, every 111 minutes, and in the frequency range 25-125 MHz. To estimate the soil parameters, we compare the impedance measurements with models produced from numerical electromagnetic simulations of the antenna, considering single- and two-layer soil models. Our best-fit soil model corresponds to a two-layer model in which the electrical parameters are consistent with unfrozen soil at the top and frozen soil underneath. The best-fit parameters further agree with measurements done at other Arctic sites with more traditional techniques, such as capacitively-coupled resistivity, electrical resistivity tomography, and ground-penetrating radar.</description>

      <title>Solving All Seismic Tomographic Problems using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a variety of geoscientific applications scientists often need to image properties of the Earth's interior in order to understand the heterogeneity and processes taking place within the Earth. Seismic tomography is one such method which has been used widely to study properties of the subsurface. In order to solve tomographic problems efficiently, neural network-based methods have been introduced to geophysics. However, these methods can only be applied to certain types of problems with fixed acquisition geometry at a specific site. In this study we extend neural network-based methods to problems with various scales and acquisition geometries by using graph mixture density networks (MDNs). We train a graph MDN for 2D tomographic problems using simulated velocity models and travel time data, and apply the trained network to both synthetic and real data problems that have various scales and station distributions at different sites. The results demonstrate that graph MDNs can provide comparable solutions to those obtained using traditional Bayesian methods in seconds, and therefore provide the possibility to use graph MDNs to produce rapid solutions for all kinds of seismic tomographic problems over the world.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary Integration of Remote Sensing -- A Review with Four Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a high-level discipline, the development of remote sensing depends on the contribution of many other basic and applied disciplines and technologies. For example, due to the close relationship between remote sensing and photogrammetry, remote sensing would inevitably integrate disciplines such as optics and color science. Also, remote sensing integrates the knowledge of electronics in the conversion from optical signals to electrical signals via CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) or other image sensors. Moreover, when conducting object identification and classification with remote sensing data, mathematical morphology and other digital image processing technologies are used. These examples are only the tip of the iceberg of interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing. This work briefly reviews the interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing with four examples - ecology, mathematical morphology, machine learning, and electronics.</description>

      <title>Power-scaled Bayesian Inference with Score-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a score-based generative algorithm for sampling from power-scaled priors and likelihoods within the Bayesian inference framework. Our algorithm enables flexible control over prior-likelihood influence without requiring retraining for different power-scaling configurations. Specifically, we focus on synthesizing seismic velocity models conditioned on imaged seismic. Our method enables sensitivity analysis by sampling from intermediate power posteriors, allowing us to assess the relative influence of the prior and likelihood on samples of the posterior distribution. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we evaluate the effects of varying the power parameter in different settings: applying it solely to the prior, to the likelihood of a Bayesian formulation, and to both simultaneously. The results show that increasing the power of the likelihood up to a certain threshold improves the fidelity of posterior samples to the conditioning data (e.g., seismic images), while decreasing the prior power promotes greater structural diversity among samples. Moreover, we find that moderate scaling of the likelihood leads to a reduced shot data residual, confirming its utility in posterior refinement.</description>
