      <title>Column and row subset selection using nuclear scores: algorithms and theory for Nystr\"{o}m approximation, CUR decomposition, and graph Laplacian reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Column selection is an essential tool for structure-preserving low-rank approximation, with wide-ranging applications across many fields, such as data science, machine learning, and theoretical chemistry. In this work, we develop unified methodologies for fast, efficient, and theoretically guaranteed column selection. First we derive and implement a sparsity-exploiting deterministic algorithm applicable to tasks including kernel approximation and CUR decomposition. Next, we develop a matrix-free formalism relying on a randomization scheme satisfying guaranteed concentration bounds, applying this construction both to CUR decomposition and to the approximation of matrix functions of graph Laplacians. Importantly, the randomization is only relevant for the computation of the scores that we use for column selection, not the selection itself given these scores. For both deterministic and matrix-free algorithms, we bound the performance favorably relative to the expected performance of determinantal point process (DPP) sampling and, in select scenarios, that of exactly optimal subset selection. The general case requires new analysis of the DPP expectation. Finally, we demonstrate strong real-world performance of our algorithms on a diverse set of example approximation tasks.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning of the generalized Stokes problem arising from the approximation of the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers standard iterative methods for solving the generalized Stokes problem arising from the time and space approximation of the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Various preconditioning techniques are considered (Cahouet&amp;Chabard and augmented Lagrangian), and one investigates whether these methods can compete with traditional pressure-correction and velocity-correction methods in terms of CPU time per degree of freedom and per time step. Numerical tests on fine unstructured meshes (68 millions degrees of freedoms) demonstrate convergence rates that are independent of the mesh size and improve with the Reynolds number. Three conclusions are drawn from the paper: (1) Although very good parallel scalability is observed for the augmented Lagrangian method, thorough tests on large problems reveal that the overall CPU time per degree of freedom and per time step is best for the standard Cahouet&amp;Chabar preconditioner. (2) Whether solving the pressure Schur complement problem or solving the full couple system at once does not make any significant difference in term of CPU time per degree of freedom and per time step. (3) All the methods tested in the paper, whether matrix-free or not, are on average 30 times slower than traditional pressure-correction and velocity-correction methods. Hence, although all these methods are very efficient for solving steady state problems, they are not yet competitive for solving time-dependent problems.</description>

      <title>Modified Singly-Runge-Kutta-TASE methods for the numerical solution of stiff differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singly-TASE operators for the numerical solution of stiff differential equations were proposed by Calvo et al. in J.Sci. Comput. 2023 to reduce the computational cost of Runge-Kutta-TASE (RKTASE) methods when the involved linear systems are solved by some $LU$ factorization. In this paper we propose a modification of these methods to improve the efficiency by considering different TASE operators for each stage of the Runge-Kutta. We prove that the resulting RKTASE methods are equivalent to $W$-methods (Steihaug and Wolfbrandt, Mathematics of Computation,1979) and this allows us to obtain the order conditions of the proposed Modified Singly-RKTASE methods (MSRKTASE) through the theory developed for the $W$-methods. We construct new MSRKTASE methods of order two and three and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear stiff systems. The results show that the MSRKTASE schemes significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy compared to previous Singly-RKTASE schemes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fourier Diffraction Theorem and Filtered Backpropagation for Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns diffraction-tomographic reconstruction of an object characterized by its scattering potential. We establish a rigorous generalization of the Fourier diffraction theorem in arbitrary dimension, giving a precise relation in the Fourier domain between measurements of the scattered wave and reconstructions of the scattering potential. With this theorem at hand, Fourier coverages for different experimental setups are investigated taking into account parameters such as object orientation, direction of incidence and frequency of illumination. Allowing for simultaneous and discontinuous variation of these parameters, a general filtered backpropagation formula is derived resulting in an explicit approximation of the scattering potential for a large class of experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Error analysis for a viscoelastic phase separation mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider systematic numerical approximation of a viscoelastic phase separation model that describes the demixing of a polymer solvent mixture. An unconditionally stable discretisation method is proposed based on a finite element approximation in space and a variational time discretization strategy. The proposed method preserves the energy-dissipation structure of the underlying system exactly and allows to establish a fully discrete nonlinear stability estimate in natural norms based on the concept of relative energy. These estimates are used to derive order optimal error estimates for the method under minimal smoothness assumptions on the problem data, despite the presence of various strong nonlinearities in the equations. The theoretical results and main properties of the method are illustrated by numerical simulations which also demonstrate the capability to reproduce the relevant physical effects observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Science DMZ Networks: How Different are They Really?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Science Demilitarized Zone (Science DMZ) is a network environment optimized for scientific applications. A Science DMZ provides an environment mostly free from competing traffic flows and complex security middleware such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems that often impede data transfer performance. The Science DMZ model provides a reference set of network design patterns, tuned hosts and protocol stacks dedicated to large data transfers and streamlined security postures that significantly improve data transfer performance, accelerating scientific collaborations and discovery.
  Over the past decade, many universities and organizations have adopted this model for their research computing. Despite becoming increasingly popular, there is a lack of quantitative studies comparing such a specialized network to conventional production networks regarding network characteristics and data transfer performance. We strive to answer the following research questions in this study: Does a Science DMZ exhibit significantly different behavior than a general-purpose campus network? Does it improve application performance compared to such general-purpose networks? Through a two-year-long quantitative network measurement study, we find that a Science DMZ exhibits lower latency, higher throughput, and lower jitter behaviors. However, we also see several non-intuitive results. For example, a DMZ may take a longer route to external destinations and experience higher latency than the campus network. While the DMZ model benefits researchers, the benefits are not automatic - careful network tuning based on specific use cases is required to realize the full potential of such infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of ZFP: Understanding Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of data generated and gathered in scientific simulations and data collection applications is continuously growing, putting mounting pressure on storage and bandwidth concerns. A means of reducing such issues is data compression; however, lossless data compression is typically ineffective when applied to floating-point data. Thus, users tend to apply a lossy data compressor, which allows for small deviations from the original data. It is essential to understand how the error from lossy compression impacts the accuracy of the data analytics. Thus, we must analyze not only the compression properties but the error as well. In this paper, we provide a statistical analysis of the error caused by ZFP compression, a state-of-the-art, lossy compression algorithm explicitly designed for floating-point data. We show that the error is indeed biased and propose simple modifications to the algorithm to neutralize the bias and further reduce the resulting error.</description>

      <title>Conforming/Non-Conforming Mixed Finite Element Methods for Optimal Control of Velocity-Vorticity-Pressure Formulation for the Oseen Problem with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the distributed optimal control of generalized Oseen equations with non-constant viscosity. We propose and analyze a new conforming augmented mixed finite element method and a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the velocity-vorticity-pressure formulation. The continuous formulation, which incorporates least-squares terms from both the constitutive equation and the incompressibility condition, is well-posed under certain assumptions on the viscosity parameter. The CG method is divergence-conforming and suits any Stokes inf-sup stable velocity-pressure finite element pair, while a generic discrete space approximates vorticity. The DG scheme employs a stabilization technique, and a piecewise constant discretization estimates the control variable. We establish optimal a priori and residual-based a posteriori error estimates for the proposed schemes. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to showcase the method's performance and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Consistency and stability of boundary conditions for a two-velocities lattice Boltzmann scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore theoretical aspects of boundary conditions for lattice Boltzmann methods, focusing on a toy two-velocities scheme. By mapping lattice Boltzmann schemes to Finite Difference schemes, we facilitate rigorous consistency and stability analyses. We develop kinetic boundary conditions for inflows and outflows, highlighting the trade-off between accuracy and stability, which we successfully overcome. Stability is assessed using GKS (Gustafsson, Kreiss, and Sundstr{\"o}m) analysis and -- when this approach fails on coarse meshes -- spectral and pseudo-spectral analyses of the scheme's matrix that explain effects germane to low resolutions.</description>

      <title>Robust First and Second-Order Differentiation for Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications such as unbalanced and fully shuffled regression can be approached by optimizing regularized optimal transport (OT) distances, such as the entropic OT and Sinkhorn distances. A common approach for this optimization is to use a first-order optimizer, which requires the gradient of the OT distance. For faster convergence, one might also resort to a second-order optimizer, which additionally requires the Hessian. The computations of these derivatives are crucial for efficient and accurate optimization. However, they present significant challenges in terms of memory consumption and numerical instability, especially for large datasets and small regularization strengths. We circumvent these issues by analytically computing the gradients for OT distances and the Hessian for the entropic OT distance, which was not previously used due to intricate tensor-wise calculations and the complex dependency on parameters within the bi-level loss function. Through analytical derivation and spectral analysis, we identify and resolve the numerical instability caused by the singularity and ill-posedness of a key linear system. Consequently, we achieve scalable and stable computation of the Hessian, enabling the implementation of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-Newton methods. Tests on shuffled regression examples demonstrate that the second stage of the SGD-Newton method converges orders of magnitude faster than the gradient descent-only method while achieving significantly more accurate parameter estimations.</description>

      <title>Smoothers with localized residual computations for geometric multigrid methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the performance of multigrid solvers on many-core architectures with cache hierarchies by reorganizing operations in the smoothing step to minimize memory transfers. We focus on patch smoothers, which offer robust convergence rates with respect to the finite element degree for various equations, in the setting of multiplicative subspace correction for numerical efficiency. By combining the computation of local residuals with local solvers, we increase the locality of the problem and thus reduce data transfers. The thread-parallel implementation of this algorithm is based on coloring, which contradicts cache efficiency. We improve data locality by rearranging the loop into batches so that more data can be reused. The organization of consecutive batches prioritizes data locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops and discusses a residual-based a posteriori error estimate and a space--time adaptive algorithm for solving parabolic surface partial differential equations on closed stationary surfaces. The full discretization uses the surface finite element method in space and the backward Euler method in time. The proposed error indicator bounds the error quantities globally in space from above and below, and globally in time from above and locally from below. A space--time adaptive algorithm is proposed using the derived error indicator. Numerical experiments illustrate and complement the theory.</description>

      <title>Control theory and splitting methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal is to highlight some of the deep links between numerical splitting methods and control theory. We consider evolution equations of the form $\dot{x} = f_0(x) + f_1(x)$, where $f_0$ encodes a non-reversible dynamic, so that one is interested in schemes only involving forward flows of $f_0$. In this context, a splitting method can be interpreted as a trajectory of the control-affine system $\dot{x}(t)=f_0(x(t))+u(t)f_1(x(t))$, associated with a control~$u$ which is a finite sum of Dirac masses. The general goal is then to find a control such that the flow of $f_0 + u(t) f_1$ is as close as possible to the flow of $f_0+f_1$.
  Using this interpretation and classical tools from control theory, we revisit well-known results concerning numerical splitting methods, and we prove a handful of new ones, with an emphasis on splittings with additional positivity conditions on the coefficients. First, we show that there exist numerical schemes of any arbitrary order involving only forward flows of $f_0$ if one allows complex coefficients for the flows of $f_1$. Equivalently, for complex-valued controls, we prove that the Lie algebra rank condition is equivalent to the small-time local controllability of a system. Second, for real-valued coefficients, we show that the well-known order restrictions are linked with so-called "bad" Lie brackets from control theory, which are known to yield obstructions to small-time local controllability. We use our recent basis of the free Lie algebra to precisely identify the conditions under which high-order methods exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical training algorithm for standard feed-forward neural networks that adaptively extends the network architecture as soon as the optimization reaches a stationary point. By solving small (low-dimensional) optimization problems, the extended network provably escapes any local minimum or stationary point. Under some assumptions on the approximability of the data with stable neural networks, we show that the algorithm achieves an optimal convergence rate s in the sense that loss is bounded by the number of parameters to the -s. As a byproduct, we obtain computable indicators which judge the optimality of the training state of a given network and derive a new notion of generalization error.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the parameter-dependent diffusion equation in a two-dimensional domain consisting of locally mirror symmetric layers. It is assumed that the diffusion coefficient is a constant in each layer. The goal is to find approximate parameter-to-solution maps that have a small number of terms. It is shown that in the case of two layers one can find a solution formula consisting of three terms with explicit dependencies on the diffusion coefficient. The formula is based on decomposing the solution into orthogonal parts related to both of the layers and the interface between them. This formula is then expanded to an approximate one for the multi-layer case. We give an analytical formula for square layers and use the finite element formulation for more general layers. The results are illustrated with numerical examples and have applications for reduced basis methods by analyzing the Kolmogorov n-width.</description>

Abstract: A new, more efficient, numerical method for the SDOF problem is presented. Its construction is based on the weak form of the equation of motion, as obtained in part I of the paper, using piece-wise polynomial functions as interpolation functions. The approximation rate can be arbitrarily high, proportional to the degree of the interpolation functions, tempered only by numerical instability. Moreover, the mechanical energy of the system is conserved. Consequently, all significant drawbacks of existing algorithms, such as the limitations imposed by the Dahlqvist Barrier theorem and the need for introduction of numerical damping, have</description>

      <title>An elasticity-based mesh morphing technique with application to reduced-order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce a new methodology for constructing morphings between shapes that have identical topology. This morphing is obtained by deforming a reference shape, through the resolution of a sequence of linear elasticity equations, onto the target shape. In particular, our approach does not assume any knowledge of a boundary parametrization. Furthermore, we demonstrate how constraints can be imposed on specific points, lines and surfaces in the reference domain to ensure alignment with their counterparts in the target domain after morphing. Additionally, we show how the proposed methodology can be integrated in an offline and online paradigm, which is useful in reduced-order modeling scenarii involving variable shapes. This framework facilitates the efficient computation of the morphings in various geometric configurations, thus improving the versatility and applicability of the approach. The methodology is illustrated on the regression problem of the drag and lift coefficients of airfoils of non-parameterized variable shapes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Low-Depth Quantum Signal-Processing Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects like entanglement and coherent amplification can be used to drastically enhance the accuracy of quantum parameter estimation beyond classical limits. However, challenges such as decoherence and time-dependent errors hinder Heisenberg-limited amplification. We introduce Quantum Signal-Processing Phase Estimation algorithms that are robust against these challenges and achieve optimal performance as dictated by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. These algorithms use quantum signal transformation to decouple interdependent phase parameters into largely orthogonal ones, ensuring that time-dependent errors in one do not compromise the accuracy of learning the other. Combining provably optimal classical estimation with near-optimal quantum circuit design, our approach achieves an unprecedented standard deviation accuracy of $10^{-4}$ radians for estimating unwanted swap angles in superconducting two-qubit experiments, using low-depth ($&lt;10$) circuits. This represents up to two orders of magnitude improvement over existing methods. Theoretically and numerically, we demonstrate the optimality of our algorithm against time-dependent phase errors, observing that the variance of the time-sensitive parameter $\varphi$ scales faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg scaling in the small-depth regime. Our results are rigorously validated against the quantum Fisher information, confirming our protocol's ability to achieve unmatched precision for two-qubit gate learning.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution-based training of Free Knot Splines and ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of one-dimensional function approximation using shallow neural networks (NN) with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and compare their training with traditional methods such as univariate Free Knot Splines (FKS). ReLU NNs and FKS span the same function space, and thus have the same theoretical expressivity. In the case of ReLU NNs, we show that their ill-conditioning degrades rapidly as the width of the network increases. This often leads to significantly poorer approximation in contrast to the FKS representation, which remains well-conditioned as the number of knots increases. We leverage the theory of optimal piecewise linear interpolants to improve the training procedure for a ReLU NN. Using the equidistribution principle, we propose a two-level procedure for training the FKS by first solving the nonlinear problem of finding the optimal knot locations of the interpolating FKS. Determining the optimal knots then acts as a good starting point for training the weights of the FKS. The training of the FKS gives insights into how we can train a ReLU NN effectively to give an equally accurate approximation. More precisely, we combine the training of the ReLU NN with an equidistribution based loss to find the breakpoints of the ReLU functions, combined with preconditioning the ReLU NN approximation (to take an FKS form) to find the scalings of the ReLU functions, leads to a well-conditioned and reliable method of finding an accurate ReLU NN approximation to a target function. We test this method on a series or regular, singular, and rapidly varying target functions and obtain good results realising the expressivity of the network in this case.</description>

      <title>Finer-Grained Hardness of Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In batch Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for a kernel function $f$, we are given as input $2n$ points $x^{(1)}, \cdots, x^{(n)}, y^{(1)}, \cdots, y^{(n)}$ in dimension $m$, as well as a vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$. These inputs implicitly define the $n \times n$ kernel matrix $K$ given by $K[i,j] = f(x^{(i)}, y^{(j)})$. The goal is to compute a vector $v$ which approximates $K w$ with $|| Kw - v||_\infty &lt; \varepsilon ||w||_1$. A recent line of work has proved fine-grained lower bounds conditioned on SETH. Backurs et al. first showed the hardness of KDE for Gaussian-like kernels with high dimension $m = \Omega(\log n)$ and large scale $B = \Omega(\log n)$. Alman et al. later developed new reductions in roughly this same parameter regime, leading to lower bounds for more general kernels, but only for very small error $\varepsilon &lt; 2^{- \log^{\Omega(1)} (n)}$.
  In this paper, we refine the approach of Alman et al. to show new lower bounds in all parameter regimes, closing gaps between the known algorithms and lower bounds. In the setting where $m = C\log n$ and $B = o(\log n)$, we prove Gaussian KDE requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to achieve additive error $\varepsilon &lt; \Omega(m/B)^{-m}$, matching the performance of the polynomial method up to low-order terms. In the low dimensional setting $m = o(\log n)$, we show that Gaussian KDE requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to achieve $\varepsilon$ such that $\log \log (\varepsilon^{-1}) &gt; \tilde \Omega ((\log n)/m)$, matching the error bound achievable by FMM up to low-order terms. To our knowledge, no nontrivial lower bound was previously known in this regime.
  Our new lower bounds make use of an intricate analysis of a special case of the kernel matrix -- the `counting matrix'. As a key technical lemma, we give a novel approach to bounding the entries of its inverse by using Schur polynomials from algebraic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive meshfree approximation for linear elliptic partial differential equations with PDE-greedy kernel methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the meshless approximation for solutions of boundary value problems (BVPs) of elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) via symmetric kernel collocation. We discuss the importance of the choice of the collocation points, in particular by using greedy kernel methods. We introduce a scale of PDE-greedy selection criteria that generalizes existing techniques, such as the PDE-P -greedy and the PDE-f -greedy rules for collocation point selection. For these greedy selection criteria we provide bounds on the approximation error in terms of the number of greedily selected points and analyze the corresponding convergence rates. This is achieved by a novel analysis of Kolmogorov widths of special sets of BVP point-evaluation functionals. Especially, we prove that target-data dependent algorithms that make use of the right hand side functions of the BVP exhibit faster convergence rates than the target-data independent PDE-P -greedy. The convergence rate of the PDE-f -greedy possesses a dimension independent rate, which makes it amenable to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. The advantages of these greedy algorithms are highlighted by numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: As a first approximation, early embryos may be modeled as foams whose shape depends on the surface tensions of each cell. However it has been remarked that exist line tensions at polarized exterior cellular interfaces (apical). In order to understand the changes it may imply on the usual foam model, a simple case study is considered: a double cell with line tension. Phase diagrams, bifurcations, possible new configurations are studied.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of large-scale nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems under model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for Bayesian nonlinear inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) under model uncertainty. Specifically, we consider inverse problems in which, in addition to the inversion parameters, the governing PDEs include secondary uncertain parameters. We focus on problems with infinite-dimensional inversion and secondary parameters and present a scalable computational framework for optimal design of such problems. The proposed approach enables Bayesian inversion and OED under uncertainty within a unified framework. We build on the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach, to incorporate modeling uncertainties in the Bayesian inverse problem, and methods for A-optimal design of infinite-dimensional Bayesian nonlinear inverse problems. Specifically, a Gaussian approximation to the posterior at the maximum a posteriori probability point is used to define an uncertainty aware OED objective that is tractable to evaluate and optimize. In particular, the OED objective can be computed at a cost, in the number of PDE solves, that does not grow with the dimension of the discretized inversion and secondary parameters. The OED problem is formulated as a binary bilevel PDE constrained optimization problem and a greedy algorithm, which provides a pragmatic approach, is used to find optimal designs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for a model inverse problem governed by an elliptic PDE on a three-dimensional domain. Our computational results also highlight the pitfalls of ignoring modeling uncertainties in the OED and/or inference stages.</description>

Abstract: We present a space-time continuous-Galerkin finite element method for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. To ensure stability of the discrete variational problem, we apply ideas from the variational multi-scale method. The finite element problem is posed on the ``full" space-time domain, considering time as another dimension. We provide a rigorous analysis of the stability and convergence of the stabilized formulation. And finally, we apply this method on two benchmark problems in computational fluid dynamics, namely, lid-driven cavity flow and flow past a circular cylinder. We validate the current method with existing results from literature and show that very large space-time blocks can be solved using our approach.</description>

Abstract: We present an extension of the linear sampling method for solving the sound-soft inverse scattering problem in two dimensions with data generated by randomly distributed small scatterers. The theoretical justification of our novel sampling method is based on a rigorous asymptotic model, a modified Helmholtz--Kirchhoff identity, and our previous work on the linear sampling method for random sources. Our numerical implementation incorporates boundary elements, Singular Value Decomposition, Tikhonov regularization, and Morozov's discrepancy principle. We showcase the robustness and accuracy of our algorithms with a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Analysis and improvement of a semi-Lagrangian exponential scheme for the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study and extend a class of semi-Lagrangian exponential methods, which combine exponential time integration techniques, suitable for integrating stiff linear terms, with a semi-Lagrangian treatment of nonlinear advection terms. Partial differential equations involving both processes arise for instance in atmospheric circulation models. Through a truncation error analysis, we show that previously formulated semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes are limited to first-order accuracy due to the discretization of the linear term; we then formulate a new discretization leading to second-order accuracy. Also, a detailed stability study is conducted to compare several Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes, as well as a well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method, which is used in operational atmospheric models. Numerical simulations of the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere are performed to assess the orders of convergence, stability properties, and computational cost of each method. The proposed second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential method was shown to be more stable and accurate than the previously formulated schemes of the same class at the expense of larger wall-clock times; however, the method is more stable and has a similar cost compared to the well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method; therefore, it is a competitive candidate for potential operational applications in atmospheric circulation modeling.</description>

Abstract: This work considers the variable-exponent fractional diffusion-wave equation, which describes, e.g. the propagation of mechanical diffusive waves in viscoelastic media with varying material properties. Rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis for this model is not available in the literature, partly because the variable-exponent Abel kernel may not be positive definite or monotonic. We overcome these difficulties to design two numerical schemes and derive their stability and error estimate based on the proved solution regularity, with $\alpha(0)$-order and second-order accuracy in time, respectively. Numerical experiments are presented to substantiate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method for generating random orthogonal matrices \(A\) that satisfy the property \(A^t S A = S\), where \(S\) is a fixed real invertible symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix. This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms. The implementation of our algorithms can be accomplished using standard linear algebra libraries.</description>

      <title>High Order Accurate Hermite Schemes on Curvilinear Grids with Compatibility Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High order accurate Hermite methods for the wave equation on curvilinear domains are presented. Boundaries are treated using centered compatibility conditions rather than more standard one-sided approximations. Both first-order-in-time (FOT) and second-order-in-time (SOT) Hermite schemes are developed. Hermite methods use the solution and multiple derivatives as unknowns and achieve space-time orders of accuracy $2m-1$ (FOT) and $2m$ (SOT) for methods using $(m+1)^d$ degree of freedom per node in $d$ dimensions. The compatibility boundary conditions (CBCs) are based on taking time derivatives of the boundary conditions and using the governing equations to replace the time derivatives with spatial derivatives. These resulting constraint equations augment the Hermite scheme on the boundary. The solvability of the equations resulting from the compatibility conditions are analyzed. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the new schemes in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

      <title>Potential Singularity of the Axisymmetric Euler Equations with $C^\alpha$ Initial Vorticity for A Large Range of $\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide numerical evidence for a potential finite-time self-similar singularity of the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl and with $C^\alpha$ initial vorticity for a large range of $\alpha$. We employ a highly effective adaptive mesh method to resolve the potential singularity sufficiently close to the potential blow-up time. Resolution study shows that our numerical method is at least second-order accurate. Scaling analysis and the dynamic rescaling method are presented to quantitatively study the scaling properties of the potential singularity. We demonstrate that this potential blow-up is stable with respect to the perturbation of initial data. Our numerical study shows that the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with our initial data develop finite-time blow-up when the H\"older exponent $\alpha$ is smaller than some critical value $\alpha^*$, which has the potential to be $1/3$. We also study the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl, and observe that the critical H\"older exponent $\alpha^*$ is close to $1-\frac{2}{n}$. Compared with Elgindi's blow-up result in a similar setting \cite{elgindi2021finite}, our potential blow-up scenario has a different H\"older continuity property in the initial data and the scaling properties of the two initial data are also quite different. We also propose a relatively simple one-dimensional model and numerically verify its approximation to the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations. This one-dimensional model sheds useful light to our understanding of the blow-up mechanism for the $n$-dimensional Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Potential Singularity of the Axisymmetric Euler Equations with $C^\alpha$ Initial Vorticity for A Large Range of $\alpha$. Part II: the $N$-Dimensional Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Part II of this sequence to our previous paper for the 3-dimensional Euler equations \cite{zhang2022potential}, we investigate potential singularity of the $n$-diemnsional axisymmetric Euler equations with $C^\alpha$ initial vorticity for a large range of $\alpha$. We use the adaptive mesh method to solve the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations and use the scaling analysis and dynamic rescaling method to examine the potential blow-up and capture its self-similar profile. Our study shows that the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with our initial data develop finite-time blow-up when the H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha&lt;\alpha^*$, and this upper bound $\alpha^*$ can asymptotically approach $1-\frac{2}{n}$. Moreover, we introduce a stretching parameter $\delta$ along the $z$-direction. Based on a few assumptions inspired by our numerical experiments, we obtain $\alpha^*=1-\frac{2}{n}$ by studying the limiting case of $\delta \rightarrow 0$. For the general case, we propose a relatively simple one-dimensional model and numerically verify its approximation to the $n$-dimensional Euler equations. This one-dimensional model sheds useful light to our understanding of the blowup mechanism for the $n$-dimensional Euler equations. As shown in \cite{zhang2022potential}, the scaling behavior and regularity properties of our initial data are quite different from those of the initial data considered by Elgindi in \cite{elgindi2021finite}.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Flame Structure and Interactions Between Chemical Reactions, Species Transport and Heat Release in Laminar Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel method for analyzing counterflow diffusion flames, inspired by Zurada's sensitivity approach for neural networks, is proposed to identify critical species influencing the heat release rate in combustion. By further analyzing concentration changes of selected key species and radicals, this method reveals complex interactions among them across regions with temperature. To illustrate this approach, the study investigates the mechanisms of auto-ignition of n-heptane and ethanol mixtures in a counterflow configuration under low strain rates. In mixtures where n-heptane is dominant, the inhibition of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) by addition of ethanol impacts the heat release rate in regions where the temperature is higher through the diffusion of specific radicals such as CH2O, C2H4, C3H6, and H2O2. In mixtures where ethanol is dominant, the high ethanol fractions in the mixture increase the heat release rate, primarily due to ethanol decomposition and its subsequent reactions. This method effectively quantifies and compares the influence of both chemical kinetics and species diffusion effects, providing detailed insights into the interactions among species across the reactive field when analyzing the counterflow configuration of complex fuel mixtures.</description>

      <title>Portable, Massively Parallel Implementation of a Material Point Method for Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent evolution of software and hardware technologies is leading to a renewed computational interest in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods such as the Material Point Method (MPM). Indeed, provided some critical aspects are properly handled, PIC methods can be cast in formulations suitable to the requirements of data locality and fine-grained parallelism of modern hardware accelerators as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Such a rapid and continuous technological development increases also the importance of generic and portable implementations. While continuum mechanics simulations have already shown the capabilities of MPM on a wide range of phenomena, the use of the method in compressible fluid dynamics is less frequent. In this paper we present a portable, highly parallel, GPU based MPM solver for compressible gas dynamics. The implementation aims to reach a good compromise between portability and efficiency and to give a first assessment of the potential of this approach in reproducing strongly compressible gas flows, also taking into account solid obstacles. The proposed model constitutes a first step towards the development of a monolithic MPM solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems at all Mach numbers up to the supersonic regime.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Learning for Provable One Step Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high generation quality with just a single evaluation of neural network.</description>

      <title>Projection scheme for a perfect plasticity model with a time-dependent constraint set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new numerical scheme for a system that includes evolution equations describing a perfect plasticity model with a time-dependent yield surface. We demonstrate that the solution to the proposed scheme is stable under suitable norms. Moreover, the stability leads to the existence of an exact solution, and we also prove that the solution to the proposed scheme converges strongly to the exact solution under suitable norms.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulations of high-density two-phase flows using projection-based Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio ($\mathcal{O}(10^5)$) two-phase flows is important for many applications in material science and manufacturing. In this work, we consider numerical simulations of molten metal undergoing microgravity oscillations. Accurate simulation of the oscillation dynamics allows us to characterize the interplay between the two fluids' surface tension and density ratio, which is an important consideration for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows under these large density ratios. A modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. [$\textit{A projection-based, semi-implicit time-stepping approach for the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations on adaptive octree meshes.}$, Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874] is used. We present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We deploy our framework to predict the oscillation behavior of three physical systems exhibiting very large density ratios ($10^4-10^5:1$) that have previously never been performed.</description>

      <title>Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Making: Principles, Algorithms and Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world decision and optimization problems, often involve constraints and conflicting criteria. For example, choosing a travel method must balance speed, cost, environmental footprint, and convenience. Similarly, designing an industrial process must consider safety, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. Ideal solutions where all objectives are optimally met are rare; instead, we seek good compromises and aim to avoid lose-lose scenarios. Multicriteria optimization offers computational techniques to compute Pareto optimal solutions, aiding decision analysis and decision making. This reader offers an introduction to this topic and has been developed on the basis of the revised edition of the reader for the MSc computer science course "Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Analysis" at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This course was taught annually by the first author from 2007 to 2023 as a single semester course with lectures and practicals. Our aim was to make the material accessible to MSc students who do not study mathematics as their core discipline by introducing basic numerical analysis concepts when necessary and providing numerical examples for interesting cases. The introduction is organized in a unique didactic manner developed by the authors, starting from more simple concepts such as linear programming and single-point methods, and advancing from these to more difficult concepts such as optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization and set-oriented solution algorithms. Besides, we focus on the mathematical modeling and foundations rather than on specific algorithms, though not excluding the discussion of some representative examples of solution algorithms.</description>
