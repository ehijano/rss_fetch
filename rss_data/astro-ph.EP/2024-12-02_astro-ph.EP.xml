      <title>A giant planet transiting a 3-Myr protostar with a misaligned disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomers have found more than a dozen planets transiting 10-40 million year old stars, but even younger transiting planets have remained elusive. A possible reason for the lack of such discoveries is that newly formed planets are not yet in a configuration that would be recognized as a transiting planet or cannot exhibit transits because our view is blocked by a protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report the observations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3 Myr, 0.7 M$_\odot$, pre-main sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. IRAS 04125+2902 hosts a nearly face-on (i $\sim$ 30$^\circ$) transitional disk and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.9 R$_\oplus$ (0.97R$_J$), and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of 90M$_\oplus$ (0.3M$_J$) from radial velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that are commonly found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4", 635 AU) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system appear to be aligned except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear. Given the rare set of circumstances required to detect a transiting planet at ages when the disk is still present, IRAS 04125+2902 b likely provides a unique window into sub-Neptunes immediately following formation.</description>

      <title>Convective mixing in distant and close-in giant planets -- Dependences on the initial composition, luminosity, bloating and semi-convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent structure models of Jupiter suggest the existence of an extended region in the deep interior with a high heavy element abundance, referred to as a dilute core. This finding has led to increased interest in modelling the formation and evolution processes with the goal of understanding how and under what circumstances such a structure is formed and retained, to in turn better understand the relation between atmospheric and bulk metallicity. We modelled the evolution of giant planets, varying various parameters relevant for the convective mixing process, such as the mixing length parameter and the size of the mesh, and parameters related to the general evolution, such as the orbital distance and the initial luminosity. We in particular studied hot Jupiters and find that the effect of bloating on the mixing process is small but can in some cases inhibit convective mixing by lowering the intrinsic luminosity for a given entropy. Semi-convection can significantly lower the extent of a dilute core if it is strong enough. We find that dilute cores are unable to persist for initial luminosities much higher than 3 x 1e3 LJ for a Jupiter-like planet for the initial heavy element profiles we studied. From this we conclude that, based on our model, it is unlikely that a large number of giant planets retain a dilute core throughout their evolution, although this is dependent on the assumptions and limitations of our method. Future work should focus on improving the link between formation and evolution models so that the mixing process is accurately modelled throughout a planet's lifetime and on improving the understanding of how to model convection near radiative-convective boundaries.</description>

      <title>Using the chi-square test to compare asteroid and laboratory reflectance spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses the Pearson's chi-square test to analyze the VNIR reflectance spectra of seven asteroids and look for spectral matches among approximately 11,000 laboratory spectra of meteoritic, terrestrial, synthetic, Apollo, and Luna samples. First, we use the chi-square method to analyze three well-studied asteroids - (4) Vesta, (6) Hebe, and (19) Fortuna - to establish the technique's reliability by attempting to confirm previously predicted spectral matches. The chi-square test is then applied to four other asteroids: the Mars trojans (5261) Eureka, (101429) 1998 VF31, (311999) 2007 NS2, and (385250) 2001 DH47. This study focuses on Mars trojans because of their undetermined origin and possible relationship to Mars. For asteroids that may have undergone space weathering, reddening effects are removed from the spectra to allow for a more accurate chi-square analysis. The top chi-square matches among the Mars trojans reveal significant spectral similarities with Martian meteorites and minerals found on Mars, supporting the hypothesis of a Martian origin for the analyzed Mars trojans. However, the possibility that these Mars trojans could be fragments of a disrupted differentiated body or bodies cannot be ruled out. We find that using the chi-square test with a large number of laboratory spectra is a very useful initial technique for identifying spectral analogs to asteroids.</description>

      <title>Potential for life to exist and be detected on Earth-like planets orbiting white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent observations confirming exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs, there is growing interest in exploring and quantifying the habitability of temperate rocky planets around white dwarfs. In this work, the limits of the habitable zone of an Earth-like planet around a white dwarf are computed based on the incident stellar flux, and these limits are utilized to assess the duration of habitability at a given orbital distance. For a typical $0.6 M_\odot$ white dwarf an Earth-like planet at $\sim 0.012$ AU could remain in the temporally evolving habitable zone, maintaining conditions to support life, for nearly 7 Gyr. In addition, additional constraints on habitability are studied for the first time by imposing the requirement of receiving sufficient photon fluxes for UV-mediated prebiotic chemistry and photosynthesis. We demonstrate that these thresholds are comfortably exceeded by planets in the habitable zone. The prospects for detecting atmospheric biosignatures are also evaluated, and shown to require integration times on the order of one hour or less for ongoing space observations with JWST.</description>

      <title>Orbital Migration through Atmospheric Mass Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric mass loss is thought to have strongly shaped the sample of close-in exoplanets. These atmospheres should be lost isotropically, leading to no net migration on the planetary orbit. However, strong stellar winds can funnel the escaping atmosphere into a tail trailing the planet. We derive a simple kinematic model of the gravitational interaction between the planet and this anisotropic wind, and derive expressions for the expected migration of the planet. Over the expected range of parameters, we find typical migrations of a few tenths to a few percent inward. We argue that this modest migration may be observable for planet pairs near mean motion resonances, which would provide an independent observational constraint on atmospheric mass loss models.</description>

      <title>The binary Yarkovsky effect on the primary asteroid with applications to singly synchronous binary asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binary Yarkovsky effect on the secondary asteroid (BYS) was recently discovered to influence binary asteroid systems by pushing the secondary asteroid toward a synchronous orbit on a short timescale. However, the binary Yarkovsky effect on the primary (BYP) remains less understood, partly due to non-linear effects from partial eclipses, but could have significant implications for singly synchronous binaries. In this work, we studied the BYP effect by numerical methods and estimated its induced orbital drifting rates for real binary asteroids. We find an empirical modified solution to estimate the effective BYP: the traditional BYP formula multiplied by $(r_s / r_p)^(\alpha -1 )$. We confirm that the BYP pushes the primary towards a synchronous orbit where its spin equals the mean motion. The parameter $\alpha$ is insensitive to the ratio of the spin rate to the mean motion and decreases slightly with increasing thermal inertia. For small binary systems with a typical thermal inertia of 200 tiu, $\alpha$ is approximately 1.7. The BYP is found to affect the mutual orbit of singly synchronous binaries with a timescale typically an order of magnitude longer than that of the BYS.
  Drift rates induced by the BYP for known small binary asteroids (primary radius &lt; 1 km) range from -0.001 to -1 cm $yr^{-1}$. A comparative analysis with observed orbital drift rates shows agreement for pre-impact Didymos and 1996 FG$_3$ but discrepancies for 2001 SL$_9$ and 1999 KW$_4$, suggesting complex dynamics in these systems involving the BYP, the binary Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (BYORP) effect, and tides. The BYP is changing the mutual orbits of most discovered binary asteroids. We suggest that the BYP should be considered along with BYORP and tidal effects when studying binary systems' long-term dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations with strong indirect terms in Fargo-like codes: Numerical aspects of non-inertial frame and artificial viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Binary star systems allow us to study the planet formation process under extreme conditions. In the early stages, these systems contain a circumbinary disk and a disk around each star. To model the interactions between these disks in the frame of one of the stars, strong fictitious forces must be included in the simulations. The original Fargo and the Fargo3D codes fail to correctly simulate such systems if the indirect term becomes too strong.
  Aims. We present a different way to compute the indirect term which, together with a tensor artificial viscosity prescription, allows the Fargo code to simulate the circumbinary disks in a non-inertial frame of reference. In this way, the Fargo code can be used to study interactions between circumstellar and circumbinary disks.
  Results. We find that updating the indirect term becomes relevant when the indirect term becomes stronger than the direct gravitational forces, which occurs for mass ratios of $q &gt; 5\%$. The default artificial viscosity used in the Fargo code inherently produces artificial pressure in a non-inertial frame of reference even in the absence of shocks. This leads to artificial mass ejection from the Hill sphere, starting at brown dwarf masses ($q &gt; 1\%$). These problems can be mitigated by using a tensor artificial viscosity formulation. For high mass ratios, $q &gt; 1\%$, it is also becomes important to initialize the disk in the center-of-mass frame. We expect our proposed changes to be relevant for other grid-based hydrodynamic codes where strong indirect terms occur, or for codes that use artificial viscosity.</description>

      <title>Magma ocean evolution at arbitrary redox state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between magma oceans and overlying atmospheres on young rocky planets leads to an evolving feedback of outgassing, greenhouse forcing, and mantle melt fraction. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the solidification of oxidized Earth-similar planets, but the diversity in mean density and irradiation observed in the low-mass exoplanet census motivate exploration of strongly varying geochemical scenarios. We aim to explore how variable redox properties alter the duration of magma ocean solidification, the equilibrium thermodynamic state, melt fraction of the mantle, and atmospheric composition. We develop a 1D coupled interior-atmosphere model that can simulate the time-evolution of lava planets. This is applied across a grid of fixed redox states, orbital separations, hydrogen endowments, and C/H ratios around a Sun-like star. The composition of these atmospheres is highly variable before and during solidification. The evolutionary path of an Earth-like planet at 1 AU ranges between permanent magma ocean states and solidification within 1 Myr. Recently solidified planets typically host H2O- or H2-dominated atmospheres in the absence of escape. Orbital separation is the primary factor determining magma ocean evolution, followed by the total hydrogen endowment, mantle oxygen fugacity, and finally the planet's C/H ratio. Collisional absorption by H2 induces a greenhouse effect which can prevent or stall magma ocean solidification. Through this effect, as well as the outgassing of other volatiles, geochemical properties exert significant control over the fate of magma oceans on rocky planets.</description>

      <title>Methods to Characterise Exoplanet Host Stars from Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key to understand exoplanets is characterisation of their host stars. One of the most powerful tools to characterise stellar properties like effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity, is spectroscopy based on observations of stellar atmospheres. This chapter describes the stellar parameters that can be derived from a spectrum with examples of well established methods and theoretical model atmospheres. Combined with photometry and parallax measurements, the outcome of the spectroscopic modelling can be used to derive stellar radii and masses.</description>

      <title>Long-term stability and dynamical spacing of compact planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet detection surveys revealed the existence of numerous multi-planetary systems packed close to their stability limit. In this proceeding, we review the mechanism driving the instability of compact systems, originally published in Petit et al. (2020). Compact systems dynamics are dominated by the interactions between resonances involving triplets of planets. The complex network of three-planet mean motion resonances drives a slow chaotic semi-major axes diffusion, leading to a fast and destructive scattering phase. This model reproduces quantitatively the instability timescale found numerically. We can observe signpost of this process on exoplanet systems architecture. The critical spacing ensuring stability scales as the planet-to star mass ratio to the power 1/4. It explains why the Hill radius is not an adapted measure of dynamical compactness of exoplanet systems, particularly for terrestrial planets. We also provide some insight on the theoretical tools developed in the original work and how they can be of interest in other problems.</description>

      <title>Retrieving wind properties from the ultra-hot dayside of WASP-189b with CRIRES$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme temperature gradients from day- to nightside in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters generate fast winds in the form of equatorial jets or day-to-night flows. Observations of blue-shifted and red-shifted signals in the transmission and dayside spectra of WASP-189b have sparked discussions about the nature of winds on this planet. To investigate the structure of winds in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189b, we studied its dayside emission spectrum with CRIRES$^+$ in the spectral K band. We used the cross-correlation method to detect emission signals of CO and Fe, and employed a Bayesian framework to retrieve the atmospheric parameters relating to the temperature-pressure structure and chemistry. The retrieval incorporated a numerical model of the line profile influenced by various dynamic effects to determine the wind structure. The cross-correlation signals of CO and Fe showed a velocity offset of ~6km/s, which could be caused by a fast day-to-night wind in the atmosphere of WASP-189b. The atmospheric retrieval showed that the line profile of the observed spectra is best fitted by the presence of a day-to-night wind of 4.4km/s, while the retrieved equatorial jet velocity of 1.0km/s is consistent with the absence of such a jet. Such a wind pattern is consistent with the observed line broadening and can explain the majority of the velocity offset, while uncertainties in the ephemerides and the effects of a hot spot could also contribute to this offset. We further retrieved an inverted temperature-pressure profile and determined the C/O ratio and metallicity. We showed that red-shifts of a few km/s in the dayside spectra could be explained by day-to-night winds. Further studies combining transmission and dayside observations could advance our understanding of WASP-189b's atmospheric circulation by improving the uncertainties in the velocity offset and wind parameters.</description>

      <title>The role of ammonia in the distribution of volatiles in the primordial hydrosphere of Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a hydrosphere on Europa raises questions about its habitability, and studies of its volatile inventory can provide insight into its formation process. Different scenarios suggest that Europa's volatiles could be derived from cometary ices or devolatilized building blocks. The study of post-accretion processes, in particular the "open ocean" phase that likely occurred before the formation of the icy crust, is crucial to distinguish these origins, as this phase is likely to have influenced the volatile inventory. The abundance of ammonia in Europa's building blocks is also crucial for understanding the composition of its ocean and primordial atmosphere. We aim to investigate ocean-atmosphere equilibrium during the post-accretion period by varying the ammonia fraction in the atmosphere. Our model evaluates the vapor-liquid equilibrium of water and volatiles, as well as the chemical equilibrium within the ocean, to study Europa's early hydrosphere. We explore two initial conditions: one in which Europa's hydrosphere originates from comet-like building blocks, and another in which it forms in equilibrium with a thick, CO$_2$-rich atmosphere. In both scenarios, the initial ratio of accreted CO$_2$ to NH$_3$ determines the magnitude of their partial pressures in Europa's early atmosphere. If this ratio exceeds a certain threshold (set to $10^{-4}$ in this study), the atmosphere will be CO$_2$-rich; otherwise, it will be CO$_2$-depleted by multiple orders of magnitude. Overall, our work provides a initial assessment of the distribution of primordial volatiles in Europa's primitive hydrosphere, and provides a baseline for interpreting data from the upcoming Europa Clipper mission.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is due to commence the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the end of 2025. To detect transient/variable sources and identify solar system objects (SSOs), the processing pipelines require templates of the static sky to perform difference imaging. During the first year of the LSST, templates must be generated as the survey progresses, otherwise SSOs cannot be discovered nightly. The incremental template generation strategy has not been finalized; therefore, we use the Metric Analysis Framework (MAF) and a simulation of the survey cadence (one_snap_v4.0_10yrs}) to explore template generation in Year 1. We have assessed the effects of generating templates over timescales of days-weeks, when at least four images of sufficient quality are available for $\geq90\%$ of the visit. We predict that SSO discoveries will begin $\sim$2-3 months after the start of the survey. We find that the ability of the LSST to discover SSOs in real-time is reduced in Year 1. This is especially true for detections in areas of the sky that receive fewer visits, such as the North Ecliptic Spur (NES), and in less commonly used filters, such as the $u$ and $g$-bands. The lack of templates in the NES dominates the loss of real-time SSO discoveries; across the whole sky the MAF Main-Belt asteroid (MBA) discovery metric decreases by up to $63\%$ compared to the baseline observing strategy, whereas the metric decreases by up to $79\%$ for MBAs in the NES alone.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dissipative Forces in Celestial Motion Using the Method of Multiple Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of nonlinear dissipative forces, specifically Gravitational Friction (GF), on the precession of celestial bodies within the framework of general relativity. We derive a modified line element by introducing a density-dependent term to model interactions between planetary bodies and the low-density interplanetary medium, providing a covariant description of dissipative forces in planetary motion. The resulting metric modification leads to corrections in the perihelion precession of Mercury, also reproducing the classical relativistic predictions. Utilizing the method of multiple scales, we analyze perturbative effects induced by GF. Using this model, we successfully constrain the medium density near Mercury to approximately $\rho_0 \approx 1.12 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{kg/m}^3$. These findings offer a new approach for incorporating dissipative mechanisms into general relativity, with potential applications in other astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental tests of the calibration of high precision differential astrometry for exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High precision differential Astrometry is the branch of astronomy that evaluates the relative position, distance and motion of celestial objects with respect to the stars present in the field of view. A mission called Theia has been submitted in 2022 for ESA's M7 call for missions, using a diffraction-limited telescope about 1m in diameter and with a field of view of 0.5 degrees, capable of achieving sub-micro-arcsecond angular accuracy, corresponding to 1e-5 pixel on the detector. Such precision makes it possible to study the nature of dark matter in our galaxy and to reveal the architecture of exoplanetary systems close to the Sun, down to the mass of the Earth. The aim of the experimental tests presented in this poster is to improve the TRL of 2 specific aspects: the calibration of new CMOS detectors with very large number of pixels and the calibration of the telescope aberrations.First, a key element of such a space telescope is the focal plane, which must be calibrated spatially with an extreme precision down to the 1e-5 pixel level. Previous work has shown that this is possible with small detector matrices (80x80 px) [1]. The goal is now to check the performances and validate this method with the new very large detectors. Pyxalis, a company based near Grenoble, is developing very large detectors (8000x5000 px) that have a low noise level and high sensitivity. The aim is to characterize and validate this type of detectors in a laboratory demonstration (see poster Pancher et al.), to ensure that the performance achieved meets the required specifications. We present the results of these characterization in this contribution.The telescope stability is also a sensitive issue. Recent work [2] has shown that the reference stars in the field of the telescope can be used as actual metrology sources in order to compute the field distortion function. Our simulations allow to model the optical aberrations with bivariate polynoms. The effects on the calibration accuracy of the degrees of the polynoms, the number of reference stars and the tilt perturbation of the M2 mirror are investigated. This poster will present the latest results obtained on a test bed developed to experimentally study the performances of this new field calibration method.</description>

      <title>A New Look at Disk Winds and External Photoevaporation in the $\sigma$-Orionis Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disk winds play a crucial role in the evolution of protoplanetary disks. Typical conditions for star and planet formation are in regions with intermediate or strong UV radiation fields produced by massive stars. The $\sigma$-Orionis cluster is the ideal site to study disk winds under these conditions; its outer parts can be used to study disk evolution, while its innermost regions to study the effect of external irradiation. For this, we analyze the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300, $\rm [NII]\,\lambda$6583, and $\rm [SII]\,\lambda$6731,$\lambda$6716 lines using high-resolution MIKE spectra of 27 classical T Tauri stars and complemented by intermediate-resolution X-shooter data. We decompose the line profiles into multiple Gaussian components. We calculated luminosities, line ratios, and kinematic properties of these components. We found that the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line luminosity and kinematic properties are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs). The frequency of single-component $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line profiles reflects the expected evolutionary stage given the intermediate age of $\sigma$-Orionis. This points to internal processes contributing to the line emission. However, the highly irradiated disks do not follow the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation found in low-mass SFRs, and all exhibit single-component line profiles. Line ratios of highly ionized species of [NII] and [SII] show higher ratios than typical values found in low-mass SFRs. The innermost regions of $\sigma$-Orionis are clearly affected by external irradiation, evidenced by the lack of correlation in the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation. The broad line widths of close-in sources, however, indicate a contribution from internal processes, such as magnetohydrodynamical winds and/or internal photoevaporation. This suggests a coevolution of internal and external winds in $\sigma$-Orionis.</description>

      <title>Silicon Isotopic Composition of Mainstream Presolar SiC Grains Revisited: The Impact of Nuclear Reaction Rate Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presolar grains are stardust particles that condensed in the ejecta or in the outflows of dying stars and can today be extracted from meteorites. They recorded the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent stars and thus serve as valuable probes of these astrophysical sites. The most common types of presolar silicon carbide grains (called mainstream SiC grains) condensed in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars. Their measured silicon isotopic abundances are not significantly influenced by nucleosynthesis within the parent star, but rather represents the pristine stellar composition. Silicon isotopes can thus be used as a proxy for galactic chemical evolution. However, the measured correlation of $^{29}$Si/$^{28}$Si versus $^{30}$Si/$^{28}$Si does not agree with any current chemical evolution model. Here, we use a Monte Carlo model to vary nuclear reaction rates within their theoretical or experimental uncertainties and process them through stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution models to study the variation of silicon isotope abundances based on these nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. We find that these uncertainties can indeed be responsible for the discrepancy between measurements and models and that the slope of the silicon isotope correlation line measured in mainstream SiC grains agrees with chemical evolution models within the nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. Our result highlights the importance of future precision reaction rate measurements for resolving the apparent data-model discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Logistic regression to boost exoplanet detection performances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets requires to separate the background noise from the exoplanet signals. Statistical methods have been recently proposed to avoid subtracting any signal of interest as opposed to initial self-subtracting methods based on Angular Differential Imaging (ADI). However, unless conservative thresholds are chosen to claim for a detection, such approaches tend to produce a list of candidates that include many false positives. Choosing high, conservative, thresholds leads to miss the faintest planets. We extend a statistical framework with a logistic regression to filter the list of candidates. Features with physical/optical meaning (in two wavelengths) are used, leading to a very fast and pragmatic approach. The overall method requires a simple edge detection (image processing) and clustering algorithm to work with sub-images. To estimate its efficiency, we apply our approach to targets observed with the ESO/SPHERE high contrast imager, that were previously used as tests for blind surveys. Experimental results with injected signals show that either the number of false detections is considerably reduced or faint exoplanets that would otherwise not be detected can be sometimes found. Typically, on the blind tests performed, we are now able to detect around 50% more of the injected planets with an SNR below 5, and with a very low number of additional candidates.</description>

      <title>3D Gap Opening in Non-Ideal MHD Protoplanetary Disks: Asymmetric Accretion, Meridional Vortices, and Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-angular resolution ALMA observations have revealed rich information about protoplanetary disks, including ubiquitous substructures and three-dimensional gas kinematics at different emission layers. One interpretation of these observations is embedded planets. Previous 3-D planet-disk interaction studies are either based on viscous simulations, or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations with simple prescribed magnetic diffusivities. This study investigates the dynamics of gap formation in 3-D non-ideal MHD disks using non-ideal MHD coefficients from the look-up table that is self-consistently calculated based on the thermo-chemical code. We find a concentration of the poloidal magnetic flux in the planet-opened gap (in agreement with previous work) and enhanced field-matter coupling due to gas depletion, which together enable efficient magnetic braking of the gap material, driving a fast accretion layer significantly displaced from the disk midplane. The fast accretion helps deplete the gap further and is expected to negatively impact the growth of planetary embryos. It also affects the corotation torque by shrinking the region of horseshoe orbits on the trailing side of the planet. Together with the magnetically driven disk wind, the fast accretion layer generates a large, persistent meridional vortex in the gap, which breaks the mirror symmetry of gas kinematics between the top and bottom disk surfaces. Finally, by studying the kinematics at the emission surfaces, we discuss the implications of planets in realistic non-ideal MHD disks on kinematics observations.</description>

      <title>CRIRES$^+$ transmission spectroscopy of WASP-127b. Detection of the resolved signatures of a supersonic equatorial jet and cool poles in a hot planet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General circulation models of gas giant exoplanets predict equatorial jets that drive inhomogeneities in the atmospheric physical parameters across the planetary surface. We studied the transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-127\,b during one transit in the K band with CRIRES$^+$. Telluric and stellar signals were removed from the data using SYSREM. The planetary signal was investigated using the cross-correlation technique. After detecting a spectral signal indicative of atmospheric inhomogeneities, we employed a Bayesian retrieval framework with a 2D modelling approach tailored to address this scenario. We detected strong signals of H$_2$O and CO, which exhibited not one but two distinct cross-correlation peaks. The double-peaked signal can be explained by a supersonic equatorial jet and muted signals at the planetary poles, with the two peaks representing the signals from the planet's morning and evening terminators. We calculated a jet velocity of $7.7\pm0.2$ km~s$^{-1}$ and derive distinct atmospheric properties for the two terminators as well as the polar region. Our retrieval yields a solar C/O ratio and metallicity and challenges previous studies of WASP-127b's atmosphere. It provides tentative evidence for the morning terminator to be cooler than the evening terminator by $-175^{+133}_{-117}$K and shows that the muted signals from the poles can be explained by either significantly lower temperatures or a high cloud deck. The presence of a clear double-peaked signal highlights the importance of taking planetary 3D structure into account during interpretation of atmospheric signals. The supersonic jet velocity and lack of signal from the polar regions, representing a detection of latitudinal inhomogeneity in a spatially unresolved target, showcases the power of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for the characterisation of global circulation in exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Clouds in partial atmospheres of lava planets and where to find them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With dayside temperatures hot enough to sustain a magma ocean and a silicate atmosphere, lava planets are the best targets to study the atmosphere of a rocky world. In the absence of nightside heating, the entire atmosphere collapses near the day-night terminator, so condensation seems inevitable, but the impact of clouds on radiative transfer, dynamics, and observables has not yet been studied in the non-global atmospheric regime. Therefore, we simulate cloud formation and determine which lava planets should be most affected by clouds. We find that despite the scattering of visible light by clouds, heat advection compensates for the cooling effect of clouds in the atmosphere. On the other hand, surface temperatures are significantly affected and can drop 100-200 K under a cloudy sky. We find that among our targets, HD213885b and HD20329b are most affected by cloud formation: there is a discernable difference between having clouds and not having them, but the precision required to make such an inference is at the limit of current instruments.</description>

      <title>The possible dual nature of the asteroid (12499) 1998 FR47</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the R-band lightcurves of the Flora family asteroid (12499) 1998 FR47, obtained in 2022 at two different astronomical sites: Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen (MPC Code 071) and Astronomical Station Vidojevica (MPC Code C89). The quadramodal lightcurves reveal a rotation period of 6.172+/-0.003 h and an amplitude of about 0.44 mag. Using the lightcurve inversion method, with the combination of our dense lightcurves and the sparse data from Gaia DR3, we found the sidereal period, an indication of a retrograde rotation of (12499) and its low-convex resolution shape. Nonetheless, the unusual shape of the quadramodal lightcurve and its additional analysis reveals two possible periods, 3.0834+/-0.0085 h and 4.1245+/-0.0151 h, making the suspect that the asteroid might be a non-synchronised wide binary system. Spectral analysis of the asteroid using data from the GAIA DR3 shows that it is either an M- or an L-type object and maybe a piece of the first planetesimals to form in the Solar System protoplanetary disk. On the other hand, (12499)'s dynamical properties indicate a significantly shorter lifetime. The asteroid lies exactly on the chaotic border of the 7:4 mean motion resonance with Mars (7M:4), alternating between being in and out of it for almost 190 Myrs. During 200 Myrs of integration, (12499) visited other resonances in the Flora family, but it never became a Near Earth Object (NEO). Additional integration of fictive objects from the 7M:4 resonance showed a possibility of transportation to the NEO region already at about 20 Myrs.</description>

      <title>Potential technosignature from anomalously low deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) in planetary water depleted by nuclear fusion technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion is viewed as an ideal energy source for humanity in the far future, given a vast seawater supply of D. Here, we consider long-lived, extraterrestrial, technological societies that develop DD fusion. If such a society persists over geologic timescales, oceanic deuterium would diminish. For an ocean mass and initial D/H that are Earth-like, fusion power use of only $\sim$10 times that projected for humankind next century would deplete the deuterium-hydrogen ratio (D/H) in $\sim$(a few)$\times 10^8$ years to values below that of the local Interstellar Medium (ISM). Ocean masses of a few percent Earth's would reach anomalously low D/H in $\sim10^6$ to $10^7$ years. The timescale shortens with greater energy consumption, smaller oceans, or lower initial D/H. Here, we suggest that anomalous D/H in planetary water below local ISM values of $\sim16\times 10^{-6}$ (set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis plus deuterium loss onto dust or small admixtures of deuterium-poor stellar material) may be a technosignature. Unlike SETI from radio signals, anomalous D/H would persist for eons, even if civilizations perish or relocate. We discuss wavelengths of strong absorption features for detecting D/H anomalies in atmospheric water vapor. These are vibrational O-D stretching at 3.7 $\mu$m in transmission spectroscopy of Earth-like worlds, $\sim1.5$ $\mu$m (in the wings of the 1.4 $\mu$m water band) in the shorter near-infrared for direct imaging by Habitable Worlds Observatory, and 3.7 $\mu$m or $\sim7.5$ $\mu$m (in the wings of the broad 6.3 $\mu$m bending vibration of water) for concepts like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE).</description>

Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>
