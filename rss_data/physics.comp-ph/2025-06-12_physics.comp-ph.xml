      <title>Implicit unified gas kinetic particle method for steady-state solution of multiscale phonon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a highly efficient implicit unified gas-kinetic particle (IUGKP) method for obtaining steady-state solutions of multi-scale phonon transport. The method adapts and reinterprets the integral solution of the BGK equation for time-independent solutions. The distribution function at a given point is determined solely by the surrounding equilibrium states, where the corresponding macroscopic quantities are computed through a weighted sum of equilibrium distribution functions from neighboring spatial positions. From a particle perspective, changes in macroscopic quantities within a cell result from particle transport across cell interfaces. These particles are sampled according to the equilibrium state of their original cells, accounting for their mean free path as the traveling distance. The IUGKP method evolves the solution according to the physical relaxation time scale, achieving high efficiency in large Knudsen number regimes. To accelerate convergence for small Knudsen numbers, an inexact Newton iteration method is implemented, incorporating macroscopic equations for convergence acceleration in the near-diffusive limit. The method also addresses spatial-temporal inconsistency caused by relaxation time variations in physical space through the null-collision concept. Numerical tests demonstrate the method's excellent performance in accelerating multi-scale phonon transport solutions, achieving speedups of one to two orders of magnitude. The IUGKP method proves to be an efficient and accurate computational tool for simulating multiscale non-equilibrium heat transfer, offering significant advantages over traditional methods in both numerical performance and physical applicability.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Performance Measures using Global Properties of Attractors for Black-Box Surrogate Models of Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In climate systems, physiological models, optics, and many more, surrogate models are developed to reconstruct chaotic dynamical systems. We introduce four data-driven measures using global attractor properties to evaluate the quality of the reconstruction of a given surrogate time series. The measures are robust against the initial position of the chaotic system as they are based on empirical approximations of the correlation integral and the probability density function, both of which are global properties of the attractor. In contrast to previous methods, we do not need a manual fitting procedure, making the measures straightforward to evaluate. Using a hypothesis testing framework, we can systematically find and reject surrogate models whose reconstructions significantly differ from the true system. Further, we show that the measures can be used as a statistical ranking metric, which in practice allows for hyperparameter optimization. Applying our measures to reservoir computing with a low number of nodes, we demonstrate how the measures can be used to reject poor reconstructions and use them as a tool to find an optimal spectral radius for which considerably fewer solutions are rejected and the overall quality of the solution improves.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Sound Energy Reduction in the Polycarbonate Plate Reinforced with Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to develop a new method for sound insulation materials reinforcement, in this study, the effect of carbon nanotubes on polycarbonate plates as a sample of materials used in acoustic insulators, have been investigated via numerical methods including finite element method (FEM) and finite difference time domain method (FDTDM). It was observed that the addition of carbon nanotubes to the polycarbonate material at frequencies below 1000 Hz increased the reflection of the acoustic wave from the surface of the polycarbonate plate and also decreased the amplitude of the acoustic wave pressure within the material. Therefore, it can be concluded that the reinforcement of polycarbonate plates by carbon nanotubes can reduce the intensity and help absorption of acoustic energy in the plate, and as a result, reduce the transmitted acoustic energy through the plate at low frequencies. Thereupon, these reinforced polycarbonate plates can be used in situations where a sound-absorbing material is needed next to the reflector material in the sound barriers.</description>

      <title>Choosing a Suitable Acquisition Function for Batch Bayesian Optimization: Comparison of Serial and Monte Carlo Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch Bayesian optimization is widely used for optimizing expensive experimental processes when several samples can be tested together to save time or cost. A central decision in designing a Bayesian optimization campaign to guide experiments is the choice of a batch acquisition function when little or nothing is known about the landscape of the "black box" function to be optimized. To inform this decision, we first compare the performance of serial and Monte Carlo batch acquisition functions on two mathematical functions that serve as proxies for typical materials synthesis and processing experiments. The two functions, both in six dimensions, are the Ackley function, which epitomizes a "needle-in-haystack" search, and the Hartmann function, which exemplifies a "false optimum" problem. Our study evaluates the serial upper confidence bound with local penalization (UCB/LP) batch acquisition policy against Monte Carlo-based parallel approaches: q-log expected improvement (qlogEI) and q-upper confidence bound (qUCB), where q is the batch size. Tests on Ackley and Hartmann show that UCB/LP and qUCB perform well in noiseless conditions, both outperforming qlogEI. For the Hartmann function with noise, all Monte Carlo functions achieve faster convergence with less sensitivity to initial conditions compared to UCB/LP. We then confirm the findings on an empirical regression model built from experimental data in maximizing power conversion efficiency of flexible perovskite solar cells. Our results suggest that when empirically optimizing a "black-box" function in less than or equal to six dimensions with no prior knowledge of the landscape or noise characteristics, qUCB is best suited as the default to maximize confidence in the modeled optimum while minimizing the number of expensive samples needed.</description>

      <title>Scale-invariant dynamics in a purely deterministic Game of Life model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07189v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a key feature that characterizes criticality in complex dynamical systems, which often organize into structures exhibiting no typical size and/or lifespan. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required for showcasing such criticality, the question of whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions remains unclear. In this work, we discover highly affirmative signatures of critical dynamics in equal-state clusters that emerge in the \textit{logistic} Game of life (GOL): an extension of Conway's GOL into a Cantor set state space that is nevertheless deterministic. We uncover at least three types of asymptotic behavior, i.e. phases, that are separated by two fundamentally distinct critical points. The first critical point -- associated with a peculiar form of self-organized criticality -- defines the non-analytic boundary between a sparse-static and a sparse-dynamic asymptotic phase. Meanwhile, the second point marks an enigmatic deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic and a third, dense-dynamic phase. Moreover, we identify distinct power-law distributions of cluster sizes with unconventional critical exponents that challenge the current paradigms for critical behavior. Overall, our work concretely paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description>

      <title>Aluminum oxide coatings on Co-rich cathodes and interactions with organic electrolyte</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become essential in modern energy storage; however, their performance is often limited by the stability and efficiency of their components, particularly the cathode and electrolyte. Transition metal layered oxide cathodes, a popular choice for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), suffer from several degradation mechanisms, including capacity fading, reactions with the electrolyte, unstable cathode-electrolyte interfaces, and lattice breakdown during cycling. In recent years, oxide coating, such as alumina, has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the durability of cathodes by forming a protective layer that mitigates detrimental reactions and improves the stability of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This study employs ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the chemical and mechanical behavior of LiCoO2 cathodes with and without aluminum oxide coatings in contact with an organic electrolyte. We examine the interactions between electrolyte molecules with both bare and coated cathode surfaces, focusing on the decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), the formation of oxygen species, and solvation dynamics, and evaluate the mechanical robustness of the cathode-coating interface using calculations of axial strain and cleavage energy. Our findings reveal that alumina coatings effectively reduce electrolyte degradation and stabilize the cathode structure, particularly under high-charge states. The coating's thickness and structural orientation are crucial in enhancing mechanical strength and minimizing detrimental reactions at the cathode-electrolyte interface. These insights contribute to the development of more durable LIBs by optimizing the interface chemistry and mechanical properties, providing a pathway toward higher energy densities and longer cycle life.</description>

      <title>Engineering topological phase transitions via sliding ferroelectricity in MBi2Te4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb) bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials combining electrically switchable ferroelectricity and tunable topological states hold significant promise for advancing both foundamental quantum phenomena and innovative device architectures. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the sliding ferroelectricity-mediated topological transitions in bilayer MBi2Te4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb). By strategically engineering interlayer sliding configurations with oppositely polarized states, we demonstrate reversible band inversion accompanied by topological phase transitions. The calculated spin-orbit-coupled bandgaps reach 31 meV (GeBi2Te4), 36 meV (SnBi2Te4), and 35 meV (PbBi2Te4), thereby enabling room-temperature observation of the quantum spin Hall effect. Crucially, these systems exhibit substantial out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization magnitudes of 0.571-0.623 pC/m, with PbBi2Te4 showing the maximum polarization (0.623 pC/m). The topological nontriviality is unambiguously confirmed by two independent signatures: (i) the computed z2 topological invariant, and (ii) the emergence of gapless helical edge states spanning the bulk insulating gap. This synergy arises from the unique sliding-induced charge redistribution mechanism, which simultaneously modulates Berry curvature and breaks in-plane inversion symmetry without disrupting out-of-plane polarization stability. The co-engineering of non-volatile ferroelectric switching and topologically protected conduction channels in MBi2Te4 bilayers establishes a material paradigm for designing reconfigurable quantum devices, where electronic topology can be electrically controlled via polarization reversal. Our results provide critical insights into manipulating correlated quantum states in van der Waals ferroelectrics for multifunctional nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of SrTiO$_3$ with Oxygen Vacancies using Neural Network Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise analysis of point defects in solids requires accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large-scale systems. However, ab initio MD simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) incur high computational cost, while classical MD simulations lack accuracy. We perform MD simulations using a neural network potential (NNP) model (NNP-MD) to predict the physical quantities of both pristine SrTiO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ in the presence of oxygen vacancies (V$_{\text{O}}$). To verify the accuracy of the NNP models trained on different data sets, their NNP-MD predictions are compared with the results obtained from DFT calculations. The predictions of the total energy show good agreement with the DFT results for all these NNP models, and the NNP models can also predict the formation energy once SrTiO$_3$:V$_{\text{O}}$ data are included in the training data sets. Even for larger supercell sizes that are difficult to calculate using first-principles calculations, the formation energies evaluated from the NNP-MD simulations well reproduce the extrapolated DFT values. This study offer important knowledge for constructing accurate NNP models to describe point-defect systems including SrTiO$_3$:V$_{\text{O}}$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Prediction of SO(3)-Equivariant Hamiltonian Matrices via SO(2) Local Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of predicting Hamiltonian matrices to accelerate electronic structure calculations, which plays an important role in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Motivated by the inherent relationship between the off-diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix and the SO(2) local frame, we propose a novel and efficient network, called QHNetV2, that achieves global SO(3) equivariance without the costly SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful SO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates and message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of SO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed within the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the symmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and MD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong generalization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames offer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of electronic structures. Our code will be released as part of the AIRS library https://github.com/divelab/AIRS.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric control of bipolar magnetic semiconductor with room Curie temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of room-temperature tunable magnetic semiconductors is crucial for the advancement of low-power, high-performance information technologies. Using density functional theory calculations, we propose a series of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors with critical temperature above room temperature, including three ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic semiconductors.Their stability is confirmed through phonon spectra, molecular dynamics simulations, and formation energy calculations. In particular, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS), Cr2NiSe4, formed via Ni intercalation into bilayer CrSe2, which exhibits a 0.40 eV band gap and a Curie temperature of 352 K. Nonvolatile carrier spin polarization control in Cr2NiSe4 is achieved by switching the ferroelectric polarization of an Al2Se3 substrate. Switching the ferroelectric state of monolayer Al2Se3 induces a BMS-to-half-metal transition. Reversing the polarization of bilayer Al2Se3 yields a half-metallic Cr2NiSe4 with fully opposite carrier spin polarization. Furthermore, we propose a multiferroic nonvolatile memory design: write operations are controlled by the ferroelectric polarization state of bilayer Al2Se3, while read operations rely on detecting the distinct carrier spin polarizations of Cr2NiSe4. Our work reports a two dimensional BMS with Curie temperature above room temperature and presents a feasible strategy for its nonvolatile electrical control.</description>

      <title>Enhancing semi-resolved CFD-DEM for dilute to dense particle-fluid systems: A point cloud based, two-step mapping strategy via coarse graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) coupling is an efficient and powerful tool to simulate particle-fluid systems. However, current volume-averaged CFD-DEM relying on direct grid-based mapping between the fluid and particle phases can exhibit a strong dependence on the fluid grid resolution, becoming unstable as particles move across fluid grids, and can fail to capture pore fluid pressure effects in very dense granular systems. Here we propose a two-step mapping CFD-DEM which uses a point-based coarse graining technique for intermediate smoothing to overcome these limitations. The discrete particles are first converted into smooth, coarse-grained continuum fields via a multi-layer Fibonacci point cloud, independent of the fluid grids. Then, accurate coupling is achieved between the coarse-grained, point cloud fields and the fluid grid-based variables. The algorithm is validated in various configurations, including weight allocation of a static particle on one-dimensional grids and a falling particle on two-dimensional grids, sedimentation of a sphere in a viscous fluid, size-bidisperse fluidized beds, Ergun's pressure drop test, and immersed granular column collapse. The proposed CFD-DEM represents a novel strategy to accurately simulate fluid-particle interactions for a wide range of grid-to-particle size ratios and solid concentrations, which is of potential use in many industrial and geophysical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant spectroscopies, which involve intermediate states with finite lifetimes, provide essential insights into collective excitations in quantum materials that are otherwise inaccessible. However, theoretical understanding in this area is often limited by the numerical challenges of solving Kramers-Heisenberg-type response functions for large-scale systems. To address this, we introduce a multi-shifted biconjugate gradient algorithm that exploits the shared structure of Krylov subspaces across spectra with varying incident energies, effectively reducing the computational complexity to that of linear spectroscopies. Both mathematical proofs and numerical benchmarks confirm that this algorithm substantially accelerates spectral simulations, achieving constant complexity independent of the number of incident energies, while ensuring accuracy and stability. This development provides a scalable, versatile framework for simulating advanced spectroscopies in quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum block Krylov subspace projector algorithm for computing low-lying eigenenergies</title>

Abstract: Determining eigenvalues is a computationally expensive task that is crucial for countless applications in natural sciences. Toward this end, we introduce the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm, a multireference quantum variant of the Lanczos algorithm designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenvalues, including degenerate states. We present three different compact quantum circuits to evaluate the required expectation values, each suited to different problem settings. To investigate the impact of the number and fidelity of the initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. The results demonstrate that using multiple initial reference states improves the convergence of the algorithm, especially in realistic precision-limited simulations and in cases where a single reference fails to simultaneously retrieve all desired eigenvalues. Furthermore, the QBKSP algorithm enables the computation of degenerate eigenstates and respective multiplicity by imposing appropriate convergence criteria.</description>

      <title>First-principles Quantum Insights into Bandgap Engineering, Valley Quantum Hall Effect, and Nonlinear Optical Response of Ge-Doped Graphene for Potential Optoelectronic Applications</title>

Abstract: The valley in the band structure of materials has gained a lot of attention recently. The promising applications of the valley degree of freedom include the next-generation valleytronic devices, quantum information processing, quantum computing, and optoelectronic devices. Graphene is an ideal quantum material for high-speed valleytronic applications because of its high carrier mobility and convenience of bandgap engineering. Employing first-principles density functional theoretical approach, this study opted bandgap engineering strategy via Germanium doping to open bandgap and enhance valley selectivity in graphene monolayers. The impact of Ge dopant concentration of 2%, 3.125%, 5.5%, and 12.5% is explored on the valleytronic; valley Hall effect, valley transport, and optical properties. The reported results demonstrate that bandgap, valley polarization, and second harmonic generation can be tuned effectively by varying doping concentration of Germanium. The Berry curvature profile is antisymmetric for corresponding K and K' valleys, thus leading to valley-dependent transport properties and a potential valley Hall effect. Finally, the second-order susceptibilities exhibit corresponding optical absorption peaks, indicating efficient second-harmonic generation due to the broken inversion symmetry. These findings highlight the potential of Ge-doped graphene for nonlinear optics and valleytronics applications, while providing novel insights into its topological phase and transport properties.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Irregular Domain Mapping and Partial Differential Equations solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of partial differential equations (PDES) on irregular domains has long been a subject of significant research interest. In this work, we present an approach utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to achieve irregular-to-regular domain mapping. Thus we can use finite difference method and physics-informed convolutional neural networks to solve PDEs on rectangular grids instead of the original irregular boundary.
  Structured grids on irregular domains are obtained by inverse mapping. We demonstrate PINN's versatile capability to produce customized structured grids tailored to diverse computational requirements, thereby significantly facilitating PDEs solving.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Science in Quantum, Atomistic, and Continuum Systems</title>

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins, materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss other common technical challenges, including explainability, out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.</description>

      <title>Accurate neural quantum states for interacting lattice bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems. However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>AeroDiT: Diffusion Transformers for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulations of Airfoil Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time and accurate prediction of aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils is crucial for flow control and aerodynamic optimization. However, achieving this remains challenging due to the high computational costs and the non-linear nature of flow physics. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face limitations in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, hindering their application in real-time scenarios. To address these challenges, this study presents AeroDiT, a novel surrogate model that integrates scalable diffusion models with transformer architectures to address these challenges. Trained on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation data for high Reynolds-number airfoil flows, AeroDiT accurately captures complex flow patterns while enabling real-time predictions. The model demonstrates impressive performance, with average relative L2 errors of 0.1, 0.025, and 0.050 for pressure p and velocity components ux, uy, confirming its reliability. The transformer-based structure allows for real-time predictions within seconds, outperforming traditional U-net diffusion models. This work underscores the potential of generative machine learning techniques to advance computational fluid dynamics, offering potential solutions to persistent challenges in simulating high-fidelity aerodynamic flows.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lie Symmetries in Physics-Informed Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators (PINOs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating Lie point symmetry information can significantly enhance the training efficiency of PINOs, primarily through techniques like data, architecture, and loss augmentation. In this work, we focus on the latter, highlighting that point symmetries oftentimes result in no training signal, limiting their effectiveness in many problems. To address this, we propose a novel loss augmentation strategy that leverages evolutionary representatives of point symmetries, a specific class of generalized symmetries of the underlying PDE. These generalized symmetries provide a richer set of generators compared to standard symmetries, leading to a more informative training signal. We demonstrate that leveraging evolutionary representatives enhances the performance of neural operators, resulting in improved data efficiency and accuracy during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the analytic adjoint solution for two-dimensional (2D) incompressible potential flow for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force using the connection of the adjoint approach to Green's functions and also by establishing and exploiting its relation to the adjoint incompressible Euler equations. By comparison with the analytic solution, it is shown that the naive approach based on solving Laplace's equation for the adjoint variables can be ill-defined. The analysis of the boundary behavior of the analytic solution is used to discuss the proper formulation of the adjoint problem as well as the mechanism for incorporating the Kutta condition in the adjoint formulation</description>

      <title>KP-PINNs: Kernel Packet Accelerated Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems. Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific computing.</description>
