      <title>Reservoir Computing-Based Detection for Molecular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based Molecular Communication (MC) is inherently challenged by severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). This is significantly amplified in mobile scenarios, where the channel impulse response (CIR) becomes time-varying and stochastic. Obtaining accurate Channel State Information (CSI) for traditional model-based detection is intractable in such dynamic environments. While deep learning (DL) offers adaptability, its complexity is unsuitable for resource-constrained micro/nanodevices. This paper proposes a low-complexity Reservoir Computing (RC) based detector. The RC architecture utilizes a fixed, recurrent non-linear reservoir to project the time-varying received signal into a high-dimensional state space. This effectively transforms the complex temporal detection problem into a simple linear classification task, capturing ISI dynamics without explicit channel modeling or complex retraining. Evaluated in a realistic 3D mobile MC simulation environment (Smoldyn), our RC detector significantly outperforms classical detectors and achieves superior performance compared to complex ML methods (LSTM, CNN, MLP) under severe ISI. Importantly, RC achieves this with significantly fewer trainable parameters (e.g., 300 vs. up to 264k for MLP) and ultra-low latency inference (approx. 1 $\mu$s per symbol).</description>

      <title>Modeling Closed-loop Analog Matrix Computing Circuits with Interconnect Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog matrix computing (AMC) circuits based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM) have shown strong potential for accelerating matrix operations. However, as matrix size grows, interconnect resistance increasingly degrades computational accuracy and limits circuit scalability. Modeling and evaluating these effects are therefore critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulators, which rely on modified nodal analysis, become prohibitively slow for large-scale AMC circuits due to the quadratic growth of nodes and feedback connections. In this work, we model AMC circuits with interconnect resistance for two key operations-matrix inversion (INV) and eigenvector computation (EGV), and propose fast solving algorithms tailored for each case. The algorithms exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, enabling rapid and accurate solutions. Compared to SPICE, they achieve several orders of magnitude acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. We further extend the approach to open-loop matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) circuits, demonstrating similar efficiency gains. Finally, leveraging these fast solvers, we develop a bias-based compensation strategy that reduces interconnect-induced errors by over 50% for INV and 70% for EGV circuits. It also reveals the scaling behavior of the optimal bias with respect to matrix size and interconnect resistance.</description>

      <title>RIoT Digital Twin: Modeling, Deployment, and Optimization of Reconfigurable IoT System with Optical-Radio Wireless Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimized Reconfigurable Internet of Things (RIoT) framework that integrates optical and radio wireless technologies with a focus on energy efficiency, scalability, and adaptability. To address the inherent complexity of hybrid optical-radio environments, a high-fidelity Digital Twin (DT) is developed within the Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) platform. The DT models deploy subsystems of the RIoT architecture, including radio frequency (RF) communication, optical wireless communication (OWC), and energy harvesting and consumption mechanisms that enable autonomous operation. Real-time energy and power measurements from target hardware platforms are also incorporated to ensure accurate representation of physical behavior and enable runtime analysis and optimization. Building on this foundation, a proactive cross-layer optimization strategy is devised to balance energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS). The strategy dynamically reconfigures RIoT nodes by adapting transmission rates, wake/sleep scheduling, and access technology selection. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework, combining digital twin technology, hybrid optical-radio integration, and data-driven energy modeling, substantially enhances the performance, resilience, and sustainability of 6G IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Advancing Lunar Communication through Inter-domain Space Networks and Dynamic Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resurgent era of lunar exploration is defined by a strategic shift from temporary visits to a sustained international and commercial presence, resulting in an unprecedented demand for a robust and continuously available communication infrastructure. The conventional direct-to-Earth communication architecture relies on limited and oversubscribed deep space networks, which are further challenged by the radiative environment and insufficient visibility in certain areas of the cislunar domain. We address these issues by proposing a foundational move toward inter-domain space network cooperation by introducing architectures based on near space networks. They can directly service lunar surface users or, via cislunar relays, by forming a resilient and multi-layered communication backbone. First, we establish a unified link analysis framework incorporating frequently disregarded environmental factors, such as the Moon's variable illumination, to provide a high-fidelity performance evaluation. Second, we assess architectures' reliability based on the outage risk, essential for quantifying the operational robustness of communication links. Finally, to manage the inherent dynamism of architectures, we propose an inter-domain space digital twin: a dynamic decision-making engine that performs real-time analysis to autonomously select the best communication path, ensuring high and stable reliability while simultaneously optimizing power consumption. Overall, our paper provides a holistic architectural and conceptual management framework, emphasizing the necessity of lunar communications to support a permanent human and economic foothold on the Moon.</description>
