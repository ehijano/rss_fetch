      <title>Sub-ion scale current sheets in kinetic Alfv\'en wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed using the kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) eigenvector relations from a two-fluid model as initial conditions, in order to study turbulent fluctuations and intermittent structures at sub-ion and electron scales. Simulations with different ion-to-electron mass ratios are set up to investigate the role of electron scales in the formation of intermittent structures. We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence. This study reveals the nature of sub-ion-scale current sheets in KAW turbulence and their role in dissipation.</description>

      <title>Different Transient Phenomena at the Edges of Traveling Foreshocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations have shown that traveling foreshocks (TFs) are bounded by either foreshock compressional boundaries (FCBs) or foreshock bubbles (FBs). Here we present four TFs with a different kind of structure appearing at one of their edges. Two of them, observed by the Cluster mission, are bounded by a hot flow anomaly (HFA). In one case, the HFA was observed only by the spacecraft closest to the bow shock, while the other three probes observed an FCB. In addition, two other TFs were observed by the MMS spacecraft to be delimited by a structure that we call HFA-like FCB. In the spacecraft data, these structures present signatures similar to those of HFAs: dips in magnetic field magnitude and solar wind density, decelerated and deflected plasma flow and increased temperature. However, a detailed inspection of these events reveals the absence of heating of the SW beam. Instead, the beam almost disappears inside these events and the plasma moments are strongly influenced by the suprathermal particles. We suggest that HFA-like FCBs are related to the evolution and structure of the directional discontinuities of the interplanetary magnetic field whose thickness is larger than the gyroradious of suprathermal ions. We also show that individual TFs may appear together with several different types of transient upstream mesoscale structures, which brings up a question about their combined effect on regions downstream of the bow shock.</description>

      <title>Lambert's problem in orbital dynamics: a self--contained introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lambert's problem is a classical boundary value problem in analytical mechanics. It arises when trying to determine the energy required to place a particle, subject to a central gravitational potential, in a "free fall" trajectory connecting two given points on a desired travel time. Due to its mathematical beauty and its relevance in aerospace engineering, it has been and remains the object of attention of countless engineers, mathematicians (pure and applied), and physicists seeking to produce efficient solution algorithms. In this expository article, didactic in nature, we present a unified and comprehensive derivation that assumes only a minimal background in physics and mathematics. We focus on the simplest unperturbed case and carefully develop the argument for elliptical trajectories. The goal is to provide a single reference that can serve as an accelerated introduction for students and researchers interested in a quick introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>Can the jet precession of M87$^\ast$ be caused by a distant intermediate-mass black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application to the case of the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$. In principle, the presence of another distant intermediate-mass black hole may concur to cause the observed jet precession, assumed tightly coupled with the accretion disk. Such a possibility is ruled out by the exclusion plots in the parameter space obtained with the approach presented here.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: The topological origin of Bohm resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta \propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>
