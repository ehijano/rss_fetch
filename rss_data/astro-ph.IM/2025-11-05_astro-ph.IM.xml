      <title>Improving Bayesian inference in PTA data analysis: importance nested sampling with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while preserving the quality of the inference.</description>

      <title>Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA data analysis II: Noise and SGWB inference through parameter decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows. We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes involved.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Electrical Properties of Prototype Readout Components for CMB-S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CMB-S4 is the fourth-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background project, designed to probe the early universe and cosmic inflation. CMB-S4 would achieve its science goals in part by dramatically increasing the number of transition edge sensor (TES) bolometer detectors on the sky. The detector readout system for CMB-S4 is time-division multiplexing (TDM) with a two-stage Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) system. To accommodate the large increase in detectors, the size of our camera increases, placing physical constraints on the readout, its wiring, and its power dissipation. Therefore, to optimize readout performance, we need to balance competing design considerations such as thermal load and bandwidth. We present results characterizing the thermal and electrical performance of prototype components, including wiring and SQUID arrays for CMB-S4, and discuss the impact on overall system performance.</description>

      <title>ASTROFLOW: A Real-Time End-to-End Pipeline for Radio Single-Pulse Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely bright, millisecond duration cosmic transients of unknown origin. The growing number of wide-field and high-time-resolution radio surveys, particularly with next-generation facilities such as the SKA and MeerKAT, will dramatically increase FRB discovery rates, but also produce data volumes that overwhelm conventional search pipelines. Real-time detection thus demands software that is both algorithmically robust and computationally efficient. We present Astroflow, an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated pipeline for single-pulse detection in radio time-frequency data. Built on a unified C++/CUDA core with a Python interface, Astroflow integrates RFI excision, incoherent dedispersion, dynamic-spectrum tiling, and a YOLO-based deep detector. Through vectorized memory access, shared-memory tiling, and OpenMP parallelism, it achieves 10x faster-than-real-time processing on consumer GPUs for a typical 150 s, 2048-channel observation, while preserving high sensitivity across a wide range of pulse widths and dispersion measures. These results establish the feasibility of a fully integrated, GPU-accelerated single-pulse search stack, capable of scaling to the data volumes expected from upcoming large-scale surveys. Astroflow offers a reusable and deployable solution for real-time transient discovery, and provides a framework that can be continuously refined with new data and models.</description>

      <title>Development of Silicon Micromachined Waveguide Filter-Banks for On-Chip Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of high-speed, spatial-mapping spectrometers in the millimeter and far-infrared frequencies would enable entirely new research avenues in astronomy and cosmology. An "on-chip" spectrometer is one such technology that could enable Line Intensity Mapping. Recent work has shown the promise of high-speed imaging; however, a limiting factor is that many of these devices suffer from low optical efficiency. Here we present the fabrication of a metalized, Si waveguide filter-bank fabricated using deep reactive ion etching for use in millimeter spectroscopy. Our design simultaneously provides high-density pixel packing, high optical efficiency, high spectral resolution, and is readily compatible with simple and multiplexable MKID arrays. Gold plated test waveguide and filter show excellent match to simulations with a measured resolving power of 263 and a loss quality factor of 1116 at room temperature. The results show promise for extending the measurements to larger, multi-wavelength designs.</description>

      <title>Precise Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of a star's radial velocity (RV) made using extremely stable, high resolution, optical or near infrared spectrographs can be used to determine the masses and orbital parameters of gravitationally-bound extra-solar planets (exoplanets). Indeed, RV surveys and follow up efforts have provided the vast majority of published exoplanet mass measurements and in doing so have enabled studies into exoplanet interior and atmospheric compositions. Here we review the current state of the RV field, with particular attention paid to:
  -The evolution of precise RV methodologies over the past two decades
  -Modern RV spectrograph designs that can be calibrated to a stability level of better than 50 cm/s over timescales of years
  -RV data reduction and post-processing techniques that minimize the impact of instrument systematics and stellar variability
  -Techniques for detecting exoplanets in RV data and disentangling planetary signals from stellar variability</description>

      <title>Computing the Full Earth System at 1 km Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first-ever global simulation of the full Earth system at \qty{1.25}{\kilo\meter} grid spacing, achieving highest time compression with an unseen number of degrees of freedom. Our model captures the flow of energy, water, and carbon through key components of the Earth system: atmosphere, ocean, and land. To achieve this landmark simulation, we harness the power of \num{8192} GPUs on Alps and \num{20480} GPUs on JUPITER, two of the world's largest GH200 superchip installations. We use both the Grace CPUs and Hopper GPUs by carefully balancing Earth's components in a heterogeneous setup and optimizing acceleration techniques available in ICON's codebase. We show how separation of concerns can reduce the code complexity by half while increasing performance and portability. Our achieved time compression of 145.7 simulated days per day enables long studies including full interactions in the Earth system and even outperforms earlier atmosphere-only simulations at a similar resolution.</description>

      <title>A robust method for identifying Be stars in the LAMOST Data Release 11 based on Deep-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Be stars are rapidly rotating B-type stars that exhibit Balmer emission lines in their optical spectra. These stars play an important role in studies of stellar evolution and disk structures. In this work, we carried out a systematic search for Be stars based on LAMOST spectroscopic data. Using low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR11, we constructed a data set and developed a classification model that combines long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks , achieving a testing accuracy of 97.86%. The trained model was then applied to spectra with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10, yielding 55,667 B-type candidates. With the aid of the MKCLASS automated classification tool and manual verification, we finally confirmed 40,223 B-type spectra. By cross-matching with published H{\alpha} emission-line star catalogs, we obtained a sample of 8298 Be stars, including 3787 previously reported Be stars and 4511 newly discovered. Furthermore, by incorporating color information, we classified the Be star sample into Herbig Be stars and Classical Be stars. In total, we identified 3363 Classical Be stars and 35 Herbig Be stars. The B-type and Be star catalogs derived in this study, together with the code used for model training, have been publicly released to facilitate community research.</description>

      <title>Lunar Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regain of interest in Moon exploration has substantially grown in the last years. For this reason, the space agencies consider the development of a precise navigation and positioning service similar to the Earth GNSS. Aiming at some meter accuracy, this requires to set up a relativistic lunar reference frame, with an associated coordinate time. If the IAU already defined the Lunar Coordinate Time TCL, there is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be adopted as reference on or around the Moon. This paper proposes a trade-off analysis of different possible options for this reference time scale. It shows that TCL is the best option to be used as practical time reference on the Moon, without the need to define a new time scale based on a scaling of TCL.</description>

      <title>Visualization of High Dynamic Range Solar Imagery and the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard visualizations of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) solar imagery often fail to convey the full complexity of the Sun's corona, especially in faint off-limb regions. This can leave the misleading impression of the Sun as a bright ball in a dark void, rather than revealing it as the dynamic, structured source of the solar wind and space weather. A variety of enhancement algorithms have been developed to address this challenge, each with its own strengths and tradeoffs. We introduce the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter (RHEF), a novel hybrid technique that optimizes contrast in high dynamic range solar images. By combining the spatial awareness of radial graded filters with the perceptual benefits of histogram equalization, RHEF reveals faint coronal structures and works out of the box -- without requiring careful parameter tuning or prior dataset characterization. RHEF operates independently on each frame, and it enhances on-disk and off-limb features uniformly across the field of view. For additional control, we also present the Upsilon redistribution function -- a symmetrized cousin of gamma correction -- as an optional post-processing step that provides intuitive programmatic tonal compression. We benchmark RHEF against established methods and offer guidance on filter selection across various applications, with examples from multiple solar instruments provided in an appendix. Implemented and available in both Python sunkit_image and IDL, RHEF enables immediate improvements in solar coronal visualization.</description>

      <title>Data availability and requirements relevant for the Ariel space mission and other exoplanet atmosphere applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this white paper is to provide a snapshot of the data availability and data needs primarily for the Ariel space mission, but also for related atmospheric studies of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. It covers the following data-related topics: molecular and atomic line lists, line profiles, computed cross-sections and opacities, collision-induced absorption and other continuum data, optical properties of aerosols and surfaces, atmospheric chemistry, UV photodissociation and photoabsorption cross-sections, and standards in the description and format of such data. These data aspects are discussed by addressing the following questions for each topic, based on the experience of the "data-provider" and "data-user" communities: (1) what are the types and sources of currently available data, (2) what work is currently in progress, and (3) what are the current and anticipated data needs. We present a GitHub platform for Ariel-related data, with the goal to provide a go-to place for both data-users and data-providers, for the users to make requests for their data needs and for the data-providers to link to their available data. Our aim throughout the paper is to provide practical information on existing sources of data whether in databases, theoretical, or literature sources.</description>

      <title>Costless correction of chain based nested sampling parameter estimation in gravitational wave data and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nested sampling parameter estimation differs from evidence estimation, in that it incurs an additional source of uncertainty. This uncertainty affects estimates of parameter means and credible intervals in gravitational wave analyses and beyond, and yet, it is typically not accounted for in standard uncertainty estimation methods. In this paper, we present two novel methods to quantify this uncertainty more accurately for any chain based nested sampler, using the additional likelihood calls made at runtime in producing independent samples. Using injected signals of black hole binary coalescences as an example, we first show concretely that the usual uncertainty estimation method is insufficient to capture the true error bar on parameter estimates. We then demonstrate how the extra points in the chains of chain based samplers may be carefully utilised to estimate this uncertainty correctly, and provide a way to check the accuracy of the resulting error bars. Finally, we discuss how this uncertainty affects $p$-$p$ plots and coverage assessments.</description>

      <title>Accelerated nested sampling with posterior repartitioning and $\beta$-flows for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an ever-growing need in the gravitational wave community for fast and reliable inference methods, accompanied by an informative error bar. Nested sampling satisfies the last two requirements, but its computational cost can become prohibitive when using the most accurate waveform models. In this paper, we demonstrate the acceleration of nested sampling using a technique called posterior repartitioning. This method leverages nested sampling's unique ability to separate prior and likelihood contributions at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we define a `repartitioned prior' informed by the posterior from a low-resolution run. To construct this repartitioned prior, we use a $\beta$-flow, a novel type of conditional normalizing flow designed to better learn deep tail probabilities. $\beta$-flows are trained on the entire nested sampling run and conditioned on an inverse temperature $\beta$. Applying our methods to simulated and real binary black hole mergers, we demonstrate how they can reduce the number of likelihood evaluations required for a given evidence precision by up to an order of magnitude, enabling faster model comparison and parameter estimation. Furthermore, we highlight the robustness of using $\beta$-flows over standard normalizing flows for posterior repartitioning. Notably, $\beta$-flows are able to recover posteriors and evidences which are generally consistent with those from traditional nested sampling, even in cases where standard normalizing flows fail.</description>

Abstract: Foundational models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning field, leveraging their capacity to learn robust representations from large-scale datasets and effectively to diverse downstream applications such as classification. In this paper, we present Astromer 2 a foundational model specifically designed for extracting light curve embeddings. We introduce Astromer 2 as an enhanced iteration of our self-supervised model for light curve analysis. This paper highlights the advantages of its pre-trained embeddings, compares its performance with that of its predecessor, Astromer 1, and provides a detailed empirical analysis of its capabilities, offering deeper insights into the model's representations. Astromer 2 is pretrained on 1.5 million single-band light curves from the MACHO survey using a self-supervised learning task that predicts randomly masked observations within sequences. Fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset allows us to assess its performance in classification tasks. The quality of the embeddings is measured by the F1 score of an MLP classifier trained on Astromer-generated embeddings. Our results demonstrate that Astromer 2 significantly outperforms Astromer 1 across all evaluated scenarios, including limited datasets of 20, 100, and 500 samples per class. The use of weighted per-sample embeddings, which integrate intermediate representations from Astromer's attention blocks, is particularly impactful. Notably, Astromer 2 achieves a 15% improvement in F1 score on the ATLAS dataset compared to prior models, showcasing robust generalization to new datasets. This enhanced performance, especially with minimal labeled data, underscores the potential of Astromer 2 for more efficient and scalable light curve analysis.</description>

      <title>MadVoro: Parallel Construction of Voronoi Diagrams in Distributed Memory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voronoi diagrams are essential geometrical structures with numerous applications, particularly astrophysics-driven finite volume methods. While serial algorithms for constructing these entities are well-established, parallel construction remains challenging. This is especially true in distributed memory systems, where each host manages only a subset of the input points. This process requires redistributing points across hosts and accurately computing the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed construction algorithm, which is implemented in our open-source C++ 3-dimensional Voronoi construction framework. Our approach leverages Delaunay triangulation as an intermediate step, which is then transformed into a Voronoi diagram. We introduce the algorithms we implemented for the precise construction and our load-balancing approach and compare the running time with other state-of-the-art frameworks. MadVoro is a versatile tool that can be applied in various scientific domains, such as mesh decomposition, computational physics, chemistry, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Leveraging pre-trained vision Transformers for multi-band photometric light curve classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a pre-trained vision Transformer (VT) model, specifically the Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2), to classify photometric light curves without the need for feature extraction or multi-band preprocessing. The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.</description>

      <title>BrahMap: A scalable and modular map-making framework for the CMB experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments have reached an era of unprecedented precision and complexity. Aiming to detect the primordial B-mode polarization signal, these experiments will soon be equipped with $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ detectors. Consequently, future CMB missions will face the substantial challenge of efficiently processing vast amounts of raw data to produce the initial scientific outputs - the sky maps - within a reasonable time frame and with available computational resources. To address this, we introduce BrahMap, a new map-making framework that will be scalable across both CPU and GPU platforms. Implemented in C++ with a user-friendly Python interface for handling sparse linear systems, BrahMap employs advanced numerical analysis and high-performance computing techniques to maximize the use of super-computing infrastructure. This work features an overview of the BrahMap's capabilities and preliminary performance scaling results, with application to a generic CMB polarization experiment.</description>
