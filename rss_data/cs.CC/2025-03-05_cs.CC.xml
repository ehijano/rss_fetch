      <title>Temporal Cycle Detection and Acyclic Temporization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In directed graphs, a cycle can be seen as a structure that allows its vertices to loop back to themselves, or as a structure that allows pairs of vertices to reach each other through distinct paths. We extend these concepts to temporal graph theory, resulting in multiple interesting definitions of a "temporal cycle". For each of these, we consider the problems of Cycle Detection and Acyclic Temporization. For the former, we are given an input temporal digraph, and we want to decide whether it contains a temporal cycle. Regarding the latter, for a given input (static) digraph, we want to time the arcs such that no temporal cycle exists in the resulting temporal digraph. We're also interested in Acyclic Temporization where we bound the lifetime of the resulting temporal digraph. Multiple results are presented, including polynomial and fixed-parameter tractable search algorithms, polynomial-time reductions from 3-SAT and Not All Equal 3-SAT, and temporizations resulting from arbitrary vertex orderings which cover (almost) all cases.</description>

      <title>How to compute the volume in low dimension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the volume of a convex body is a canonical problem in theoretical computer science. Its study has led to major advances in randomized algorithms, Markov chain theory, and computational geometry. In particular, determining the query complexity of volume estimation to a membership oracle has been a longstanding open question. Most of the previous work focuses on the high-dimensional limit. In this work, we tightly characterize the deterministic, randomized and quantum query complexity of this problem in the high-precision limit, i.e., when the dimension is constant.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Complexity of the Spectral Gap Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the spectral gap of a local Hamiltonian is known to be contained in the class $P^{QMA[log]}$: polynomial time with access to a logarithmic number of QMA queries. The problem was shown to be hard for $P^{UQMA[log]}$, a weaker class, under Turing reductions by Gharibian and Yirka [arXiv:1606.05626].
  I give a brief proof that the Spectral Gap problem is QMA-hard under a many-one (Karp) reduction. Consequently, the problem is $P^{QMA[log]}$-complete under truth-table reductions.
  It remains open to characterize the complexity of the Spectral Gap problem under many-one reductions. I conjecture that the problem belongs to a strict subclass of $P^{QMA[log]}$.</description>

      <title>Computational Equivalence of Spiked Covariance and Spiked Wigner Models via Gram-Schmidt Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show the first average-case reduction transforming the sparse Spiked Covariance Model into the sparse Spiked Wigner Model and as a consequence obtain the first computational equivalence result between two well-studied high-dimensional statistics models. Our approach leverages a new perturbation equivariance property for Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, enabling removal of dependence in the noise while preserving the signal.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Complexity of Multi-Objective Integer Network Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>CMSO-transducing tree-like graph decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that given a graph G we can CMSO-transduce its modular decomposition, its split decomposition and its bi-join decomposition. This improves results by Courcelle [Logical Methods in Computer Science, 2006] who gave such transductions using order-invariant MSO, a strictly more expressive logic than CMSO. Our methods more generally yield CMSO[2]-transductions of the canonical decomposition of weakly-partitive set systems and weakly-bipartitive systems of bipartitions.</description>
