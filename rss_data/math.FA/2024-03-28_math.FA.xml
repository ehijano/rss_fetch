      <title>Partial Dynamical Systems of $L^p$-Spaces and their Stability Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the convolution product and weak derivatives, we consider the partial dynamical systems of the locally convex $L^p(\Omega)$ spaces defined by the action of the smooth algebra $\mathscr{K}(\Omega)$ through its nets. Slice analysis is then employed to show that the Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ are the stable states or space of these partial dynamical systems as limit spaces of the convolution actions of the smooth algebra $K(\Omega)$ on the Banach spaces $L^p(\Omega)$. Thus, the Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ are closed subspaces of the $Lp(\Omega)$-spaces under convolution product and weak derivatives, with the weak derivative operators acting as equivariant maps of the slice spaces.</description>

      <title>Prony's Method in Banach Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the classical Prony's method for recovery of a sparse signal from its consecutive Fourier coefficients can be viewed as a spectral identification problem for an unknown restriction of a known linear operator. This presents a unified point of view on various existing and novel generalizations and applications of the method, some of which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Friedrichs and Kre\u{\i}n type extensions in terms of representing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semibounded operator or relation $S$ in a Hilbert space with lower bound $m \in {\mathbb R}$ has a symmetric extension $S_{\rm f}=S {\, \widehat + \,} (\{0\} \times {\rm mul\,} S^*)$, the weak Friedrichs extension of $S$, and a selfadjoint extension $S_{\rm F}$, the Friedrichs extension of $S$, that satisfy $S \subset S_{\rm f} \subset S_{\rm F}$. The Friedrichs extension $S_{\rm F}$ has lower bound $\gamma$ and it is the largest semibounded selfadjoint extension of $S$. Likewise, for each $c \leq \gamma$, the relation $S$ has a weak Kre\u{\i}n type extension $S_{{\rm k},c}=S {\, \widehat + \,} (\ker (S^*-c) \times \{0\})$ and Kre\u{\i}n type extension $S_{{\rm K},c}$ of $S$, that satisfy $S \subset S_{{\rm k},c} \subset S_{{\rm K},c}$. The Kre\u{\i}n type extension $S_{{\rm K},c}$ has lower bound $c$ and it is the smallest semibounded selfadjoint extension of $S$ which is bounded below by $c$. In this paper these special extensions and, more generally, all extremal extensions of $S$ are constructed in terms of a representing map for ${\mathfrak t}(S)-c$ and their properties are being considered.</description>

      <title>de Branges-Rovnyak spaces which are complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider de Branges-Rovnyak spaces of a considerably large class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and find a characterization for them to be complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces. This extends as well as recovers earlier characterizations obtained for the Hardy space over the unit disc (\cite{Chu}) as well as for the Drury-Arveson space over the unit ball (\cite{Jesse}). Our characterization takes a complete form for the particular cases of the Hardy space over the polydisc and the Bergman space over the disc. We show that a non-trivial de Branges-Rovnyak space, associated to a contractive multiplier, of the Hardy space over the bidisc or the Bergman space over the unit disc is a complete Nevanlinna-Pick space if and only if it is isometrically isomorphic to the Hardy space over the unit disc. On the contrary, it is shown that non-trivial de Branges-Rovnyak spaces of the Hardy space over the $n$-disc with $n\ge 3$ are never complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces.</description>

      <title>Carleman factorization of layer potentials on smooth domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the unexplored benefits of studying layer potentials on smooth, closed hypersurfaces of Euclidean space is the factorization of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator into a product of two self-adjoint transforms. Resurrecting some pertinent indications of Carleman and M. G. Krein, we exploit this grossly overlooked structure by confining the spectral analysis of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator to the amenable $L^2$-space setting, rather than bouncing back and forth the computations between Sobolev spaces of negative or positive fractional order. An enhanced, fresh new look at symmetrizable linear transforms enters into the picture in the company of geometric-microlocal analysis techniques. The outcome is manyfold, complementing recent advances on the theory of layer potentials, in the smooth boundary setting.</description>

      <title>Barely alternating real almost chains and extension operators for compact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assume $\text{MA}(\kappa)$. We show that for every real chain of size $\kappa$ in the quotient Boolean algebra $P(\omega)/fin$ we can find an almost chain of representatives such that every $n\in\omega$ oscillates at most three times along the almost chain. This is used to show that for every countable discrete extension of a separable compact line $K$ of weight $\kappa$ there exists an extension operator $E:C(K)\longrightarrow C(L)$ of norm at most three.</description>

      <title>A nontrivial uniform algebra Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that there exists a nontrivial uniform algebra that is Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space and has a dense set of elements that are exponentials. This answers a 64-year-old question of John Wermer and a 16-year-old question of Garth Dales and Joel Feinstein. Our example is P(X) for a certain compact set X in complex Euclidean 2-space ($\mathbb{C}^2$). It is also shown that there exists a logmodular uniform algebra with proper Shilov boundary but with no nontrivial Gleason parts. This answers a modified form of another 64-year-old question of Wermer.</description>

      <title>Preserving positivity for rank-constrained matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0042</link>
      <description>arXiv:1406.0042v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entrywise functions preserving the cone of positive semidefinite matrices have been studied by many authors, most notably by Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9, 1942] and Rudin [Duke Math. J. 26, 1959]. Following their work, it is well-known that entrywise functions preserving Loewner positivity in all dimensions are precisely the absolutely monotonic functions. However, there are strong theoretical and practical motivations to study functions preserving positivity in a fixed dimension $n$. Such characterizations for a fixed value of $n$ are difficult to obtain, and in fact are only known in the $2 \times 2$ case. In this paper, using a novel and intuitive approach, we study entrywise functions preserving positivity on distinguished submanifolds inside the cone obtained by imposing rank constraints. These rank constraints are prevalent in applications, and provide a natural way to relax the elusive original problem of preserving positivity in a fixed dimension. In our main result, we characterize entrywise functions mapping $n \times n$ positive semidefinite matrices of rank at most $l$ into positive semidefinite matrices of rank at most $k$ for $1 \leq l \leq n$ and $1 \leq k &lt; n$. We also demonstrate how an important necessary condition for preserving positivity by Horn and Loewner [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 136, 1969] can be significantly generalized by adding rank constraints. Finally, our techniques allow us to obtain an elementary proof of the classical characterization of functions preserving positivity in all dimensions obtained by Schoenberg and Rudin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12765v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sun dual space corresponding to a strongly continuous semigroup is a known concept when dealing with dual semigroups, which are in general only weak$^*$-continuous. In this paper we develop a corresponding theory for bi-continuous semigroups under mild assumptions on the involved locally convex topologies. We also discuss sun reflexivity and Favard spaces in this context, extending classical results by van Neerven.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Strict Cone Separation Theorems in Real Normed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive some new results for the separation of two not necessarily convex cones by a (convex) cone / conical surface in real (reflexive) normed spaces. In essence, we follow the nonlinear and nonsymmetric separation approach developed by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J. Optim. 20), which is based on augmented dual cones and Bishop-Phelps type (normlinear) separating functions. Compared to Kasimbeyli's separation theorem, we formulate our theorems for the separation of two cones under weaker conditions (concerning convexity and closedness requirements) with respect to the involved cones. By a new characterization of the algebraic interior of augmented dual cones in real normed spaces, we are able to establish relationships between our cone separation results and the results derived by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J. Optim. 20) and by Garcia-Castano, Melguizo-Padial and Parzanese (2023, Math. Meth. Oper. Res. 97).</description>

Abstract: A complex scalar k is said to be an extended eigenvalue of a bounded linear operator A on a complex Hilbert space if there is a nonzero operator X such that AX=kXA. There are some solutions to the problem of computing the extended eigenvalues for composition operators induced on the Fock space and Bergman space by linear fractional transformationsof the complex plane in this paper.</description>

      <title>2-positive contractive projections on noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.03128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the first theorem on projections on general noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces associated with non-type I von Neumann algebras where $1 \leqslant p &lt; \infty$. This is the first progress on this topic since the seminal work of Arazy and Friedman [Memoirs AMS 1992] where the problem of the description of contractively complemented subspaces of noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces is explicitly raised. We show that the range of a 2-positive contractive projection on an arbitrary noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-space is completely order isometrically isomorphic to some noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-space. This result is sharp and is even new for Schatten spaces $S^p$. Our approach relies on non-tracial Haagerup's noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces in an essential way, even in the case of a projection acting on a Schatten space and is unrelated to the methods of Arazy and Friedman.</description>
