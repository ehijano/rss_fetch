      <title>Impacting spheres: from liquid drops to elastic beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning the Entropy to Estimate Free Energy Differences without Sampling Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic phase transitions, a central concept in physics and chemistry, are typically controlled by an interplay of enthalpic and entropic contributions. In most cases, the estimation of the enthalpy in simulations is straightforward but evaluating the entropy is notoriously hard. As a result, it is common to induce transitions between the metastable states and estimate their relative occupancies, from which the free energy difference can be inferred. However, for systems with large free energy barriers, sampling these transitions is a significant computational challenge. Dedicated enhanced sampling algorithms require significant prior knowledge of the slow modes governing the transition, which is typically unavailable. We present an alternative approach, which only uses short simulations of each phase separately. We achieve this by employing a recently developed deep learning model for estimating the entropy and hence the free energy of each metastable state. We benchmark our approach calculating the free energies of crystalline and liquid metals. Our method features state-of-the-art precision in estimating the melting transition temperature in Na and Al without requiring any prior information or simulation of the transition pathway itself.</description>

      <title>Solute dispersion boosts the phoretic removal of colloids from dead-end pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting and controlling the transport of colloids in porous media is essential for a broad range of applications, from drug delivery to contaminant remediation. Chemical gradients are ubiquitous in these environments, arising from reactions, precipitation/dissolution, or salinity contrasts, and can drive particle motion via diffusiophoresis. Yet our current understanding mostly comes from idealized settings with sharply imposed solute gradients, whereas in porous media, flow disorder enhances solute dispersion, and leads to diffuse solute fronts. This raises a central question: does front dispersion suppress diffusiophoretic migration of colloids in dead-end pores, rendering the effect negligible at larger scales? We address this question using an idealized one-dimensional dead-end geometry. We derive an analytical model for the spatiotemporal evolution of colloids subjected to slowly varying solute fronts and validate it with numerical simulations and microfluidic experiments. Counterintuitively, we find that diffuseness of solute front enhances removal from dead-end pores: although smoothing reduces instantaneous gradient magnitude, it extends the temporal extent of phoretic forcing, yielding a larger cumulative drift and higher clearance efficiency than sharp fronts. Our results highlight that solute dispersion does not weaken the phoretic migration of colloids from dead-end pores, pointing to the potential relevance of diffusiophoresis at larger scales, with implications for filtration, remediation, and targeted delivery in porous media.</description>

      <title>Energy-Conserving Contact Dynamics of Nonspherical Rigid-Body Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the contact dynamics of nonspherical particles beyond the microscale is crucial for accurately modeling colloidal and granular systems, where shape anisotropy dictates structural organization and transport properties. In this paper, we introduce an energy-conserving contact dynamics framework for arbitrary convex rigid-body particles, integrating vertex-boundary interactions in 2D with vertex-surface and edge-edge detection in 3D. This formulation enables continuous force evaluation and strictly prevents particle overlap while conserving total energy during translational and rotational motion. Simulations of polygonal and polyhedral particles confirm the framework's stability and demonstrate its capability to capture packing behavior, anisotropic diffusion, and equations of state. The framework establishes a robust and extensible foundation for investigating the nonequilibrium dynamics of complex nonspherical particle systems, with potential applications in colloidal self-assembly, granular flow, and hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Flow-Induced Phase Separation for Active Brownian Particles in Four-Roll-Mill Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of active Brownian particles (ABPs) subjected to a steady two-dimensional four-roll-mill flow using numerical simulations. By varying the packing fraction ($\phi$), we uncover a novel flow-induced phase separation (FIPS) that emerges beyond a critical density ($\phi \geq 0.6$). The mean-square displacement (MSD) exhibits an intermediate bump between ballistic and diffusive regimes, indicating transient trapping and flow-guided clustering. The effective diffusivity decreases quadratically with $\phi$, while the drift velocity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that large-scale transport is primarily dictated by the background flow. Number fluctuations show a crossover from normal to giant scaling, signaling the onset of long-range density inhomogeneities in the FIPS regime. Our findings provide new insights into the coupling between activity, crowding, and flow, offering a unified framework for understanding phase behavior in driven active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Exotic Acoustic-Edge and Thermal Scaling in Disordered Hyperuniform Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles theory for the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and thermal properties of network materials built on stationary correlated disordered point configurations. For scalar (mass--spring) models whose dynamical matrix is a distance-weighted graph Laplacian, we prove that the limiting spectral measure is the pushforward of Lebesgue measure by a Fourier symbol that depends only on the edge kernel \(f\) and the two-point statistics \(g_2\) (equivalently the structure factor \(S\)). For hyperuniform systems with small-$k$ scaling \(S(k)\sim k^\alpha\) and compensated kernels, {the VDOS exhibits an algebraic \emph{pseudogap} at low frequency, \(g(\omega)\sim \omega^{\,2d/\beta-1}\) with \(\beta=\min\{4,\alpha+2\}\), which implies a low-temperature specific heat \(C(T)\sim T^{\,2d/\beta}\) and a heat-kernel decay \(Z(t)\sim t^{-d/\beta}\), defining a spectral dimension \(d_s=2d/\beta\).} This hyperuniformity-induced algebraic edge depletion could enable novel wave manipulation and low-temperature applications. Generalization to vector mechanical models and implications on material design are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Gradient Effects on Electric Double Layer Screening in Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature gradients drive asymmetric ion distributions via thermodiffusion (Soret effect), leading to deviations from the classical Debye--H\"uckel potential. We analyze non-isothermal electric double layers using dimensionless Soret coefficients $\alpha_\pm$ (for cations and anions, respectively). Analytical solutions of the generalized Debye--H\"uckel equation show that, for $\alpha_+ = \alpha_-$, the potential is exactly described by a modified Bessel function, while the marginal case $\alpha_\pm = 1$ exhibits algebraic decay. An effective screening length, $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, characterizes the near-electrode potential and increases with temperature, resulting in weaker screening on the hot side and stronger on the cold side for $\alpha_\pm &gt; -1$. The differential capacitance is controlled by $\alpha_\pm$ via $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, with its minimum coinciding with the potential of zero charge (PZC) even under a temperature gradient. These findings highlight the fundamental coupling between electrostatics and thermodiffusion in non-isothermal electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Self-organization, Memory and Learning: From Driven Disordered Systems to Living Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered systems subject to a fluctuating environment can self-organize into a complex history-dependent response, retaining a memory of the driving. In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.</description>

      <title>Associative and Segregative Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation in Macromolecular Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and interfacial properties of two LLPS modes: associative (ALLPS) and segregative (SLLPS). Analytical expressions for the critical point (CP) and binodal boundaries are derived and show excellent agreement with self-consistent field (SCF) lattice computations. Distinct thermodynamic features differentiate ALLPS from SLLPS: (1) in ALLPS, polymers co-concentrate within a single dense phase coexisting with a solvent-rich phase, whereas in SLLPS each polymer forms a separate phase; (2) the attractive interaction per monomer in ALLPS is strongly dependent on solvent quality, but solvent-independent in SLLPS; and (3) ALLPS binodals exhibit near-universal behavior, largely independent of solvent content. SCF results further show that interfacial tension increases and interfacial width decreases with distance from the CP. We provide scaling relations for both quantities are provided. Compared with SLLPS, ALLPS displays higher interfacial tension and a thinner interface, reflecting distinct molecular organization at the liquid-liquid boundary.</description>

      <title>Flocking in weakly nonreciprocal mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that weakly nonreciprocal alignment leads to large-scale structure formation in flocking mixtures. By combining numerical simulations of a binary Vicsek model and the analysis of coarse-grained continuum equations, we demonstrate that nonreciprocity destabilizes the ordered phase formed by mutually aligning or anti-aligning species in a large part of the phase diagram. For aligning populations, this instability results in one species condensing in a single band that travels within a homogeneous liquid of the other species. When interactions are anti-aligning, both species self-assemble into polar clusters with large-scale chaotic dynamics. In both cases, the emergence of structures is accompanied by the demixing of the two species, despite the absence of repulsive interactions. Our theoretical analysis allows us to elucidate the origin of the instability, and show that it is generic to nonreciprocal flocks.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents of fluid-fluid interfacial tensions near a critical endpoint in a nonwetting gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid three-phase equilibria, with phases $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, are studied close to a tricritical point, analytically and numerically, in a mean-field density-functional theory with two densities. Employing Griffiths' scaling for the densities, the interfacial tensions of the wet and nonwet interfaces are analysed. The mean-field critical exponent is obtained for the vanishing of the critical interfacial tension $\sigma_{\beta\gamma}$ as a function of the deviation of the noncritical interfacial tension $\sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$ from its limiting value at a critical endpoint $\sigma_{\alpha,\beta\gamma}$. In the wet regime, this exponent is $3/2$ as expected. In the nonwetting gap of the model, the exponent is again $3/2$, except for the approach to the critical endpoint on the neutral line where $\sigma_{\alpha\beta} = \sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$. When this point is approached along any path with $\sigma_{\alpha\beta} \neq \sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$, or along the neutral line, $\sigma_{\beta\gamma} \propto | \sigma_{\alpha\gamma} - \sigma_{\alpha,\beta\gamma}|^{3/4}$, featuring an anomalous critical exponent $3/4$, which is an exact result derived by analytic calculation and explained by geometrical arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by various recent experimental findings, we propose a dynamical model of intermittently self-propelled particles: active particles that recurrently switch between two modes of motion, namely an active run-state and a turn state, in which self-propulsion is absent. The durations of these motility modes are derived from arbitrary waiting-time distributions. We derive the expressions for exact forms of transport characteristics like mean-square displacements and diffusion coefficients to describe such processes. Furthermore, the conditions for the emergence of sub- and superdiffusion in the long-time limit are presented. We give examples of some important processes that occur as limiting cases of our system, including run-and-tumble motion of bacteria, L\'evy walks, hop-and-trap dynamics, intermittent diffusion and continuous time random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface curvature of membranes, interfaces, and substrates plays a crucial role in shaping the self-assembly of particles adsorbed on these surfaces. However, little is known about the interplay between particle anisotropy and surface curvature and how they couple to alter the free energy landscape of particle assemblies. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of prescribed curvatures on a quasi-2D assembly of anisotropic patchy particles. By varying curvature and surface coverage, we uncover a rich geometric phase diagram, with curvature inducing ordered structures entirely absent on planar surfaces. Large spatial domains of ordered structures can contain hidden microdomains of orientational textures imprinted by the surface on the assembly. The dynamical landscape is also reshaped by surface curvature, with a glass-like state emerging at modest densities and high curvature. Changes to the symmetry of the surface curvature are found to result in distinct structures, including phases with mesoscale ordering. Our findings show that the coupling between surface curvature and particle geometry opens an unexplored space of morphologies and structures that can be exploited for material design.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Non-equilibrium Structures of Active Dipolar Particles by an External Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of an external alignment field on the structure formation and polarization behavior of low-density dipolar active particles in three dimensions. Performing extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we characterize the interplay between long-range dipolar interactions, field alignment, and self-propulsion. We find that the competition between activity (favoring bond breaking) and the field's orientational constraint (promoting bond formation) gives rise to a rich variety of self-assembled, actuated structures. At low to intermediate field strengths, disordered fluids composed of active chains and active percolated networks can emerge, whereas strong fields drive the formation of polarized columnar clusters. Counterintuitively, low activity levels significantly extend the range of field strengths over which percolated networks persist. This structural evolution manifests in the polarization response of strongly dipolar systems, which exhibit a transition from super-Langevin to sub-Langevin behavior with increasing activity, as a result of the coupling between structure formation and activity-induced bond breaking.</description>

Abstract: Phase-field methods offer a versatile computational framework for simulating large-scale morphological evolution. However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no version of this approach that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. Leveraging molecular coarse-graining, we describe the formulation of an order parameter-based free energy functional appropriate for a phase-field description via the enhanced sampling of rare events. We demonstrate our approach on ice nucleation dynamics, achieving a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models and systematically bridges the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models.</description>

      <title>Topology of the simplest gene switch</title>

Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here, we show how a topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm would fail. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized multimodal stationary phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the single-mode and bimodal phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of the steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Self-organized epithelial reticulum inhibits cell proliferation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. Within the epithelial layer arises a self-organized reticulum comprising two interpenetrating multiscale networks: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells embedded within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of these networks was found to be susceptible to specific mechanical and molecular stimuli. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that is well-captured by network theory, and implies self-organization and proximity to criticality. Thus, the findings demonstrate a completely new biological paradigm - reticular inhibition of proliferation (RIP).</description>
