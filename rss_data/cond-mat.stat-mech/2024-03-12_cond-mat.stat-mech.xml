      <title>Non Equilibrium Transitions in a Polymer Replication Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fuel-driven process of replication in living systems generates distributions of copied entities with varying degrees of copying accuracy. Here we introduce a thermodynamically consistent ensemble for investigating universal population features of replicating systems. In the context of copolymer copying, coarse-graining over molecular details, we establish a phase diagram of copying accuracy. We discover sharp non-equilibrium transitions between populations of random and accurate copies. Maintaining a population of accurate copies requires a minimum energy expenditure that depends on the configurational entropy of copolymer sequences.</description>

      <title>Distributed fixed resources exchanging particles: Phases of an asymmetric exclusion process connected to two reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a conceptual one-dimensional model to explore how the combined interplay between fixed resources and particle exchanges between different parts of an extended system can affect the stationary densities in a current carrying channel connecting different parts of the system. To this end, we consider model composed of a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in a lattice connecting two particle reservoirs without any internal dynamics but which can exchange particles, ensuring nonvanishing currents in the steady states. The total particle number in the system that defines the ``resources'' available, although is kept constant by the model dynamics, but can take any value independent of the model parameters that define the dynamical update rules. We show that the resulting phase diagrams of the model are parametrised by the parameters which define the various dynamical update rules together with the total available resources. These parameters can be tuned to make the density on the TASEP lane globally uniform or piecewise continuous, and can also control populations of the two reservoirs. In general, the phase diagrams are quite different from a TASEP with open boundaries. In the limit of large amount of resources, the phase diagrams become topologically identical to that for an open TASEP.</description>

      <title>Discrete Boltzmann model with split collision for combustion with nonequilibrium effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-relaxation-time discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) with split collision is proposed for both subsonic and supersonic compressible combustion where the chemical reaction takes place among various components. The physical model is based on a unified set of discrete Boltzmann equations which describes the evolution of each chemical species with an adjustable acceleration, specific heat ratio and Prandtl number. On the righ-hand side of discrete Boltzmann equations, the collision, force, and reaction terms denote the change rates of distribution functions due to self- and cross-collisions, external forces, and chemical reactions. The source terms can be calculated in three ways among which the matrix inversion method possesses the highest physical accuracy and computational efficiency. Via the Chapman-Enskog analysis, it is proved that the DBM is consistent with the reactive Navier-Stokes equations with external forces, Fick's law and Stefan-Maxwell diffusion equation in the hydrodynamic limit. Compared with the one-step-relaxation model, the hydrodynamic, thermodynamic, and chemical nonequilibrium effects can be captured and measured more detailedly and precisely by the split collision model. Finally, the model is validated by six benchmarks, i.e., the multicomponent diffusion, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, mixture in the force field, flame at constant pressure, opposing chemical reaction, and steady detonation.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phase Transition in a 2D Ferromagnetic Spins with Effective Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium phase transitions (PTs) in a 2D ferromagnetic Ising model on a square lattice with effective interactions via Monte Carlo (MC) based computational algorithms. Possibly, we simplify the generic complexity of energy function describing the system model to manage the algorithms. The importance of accounting for the effective interactions to admit establishing the nature of nonequilibrium PT emphasizes. The existence of an effective parameter $h$ is verified employing mean-field theory, and the self-consistent equations (SCEs) are derived based on the two familiar dynamics$-$Metropolis and Glauber algorithms. The results qualitatively demonstrate that both dynamics estimate the same SCE for $-1&lt;h&lt;1$. We show the critical temperature $T_{c}$ of the model {\it with} effective interactions to be given as $T_{c}(h\neq 0)=4(1+h)/\ln(3 + 2\sqrt{2})$ where $T_{c}^{0}=T_{c}(h=0)$ retrieves the well-known analytical result of equilibrium Ising model {\it without} the effective interactions. Furthermore, we perform Metropolis MC simulations for a finite system of different lattice sizes with periodic boundary conditions and measure physical quantities of interest. By using data of the measurements, $T_{c}(h)$ and relevant critical { \it exponents} for various values of $h$ are determined employing finite-size scaling (FSS) techniques. The FSS result of $T_{c}(h\neq 0)$ obtained from numerical data is accurately in agreement with analytical results and quite different from $T_{c}^{0}$ as expected. Even so, the numerical results of the exponents are consistent with analytical values of the equilibrium 2D Ising model$-$belonging to the same universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this book, we study Statistical Physics under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, starting from the definition of statistical ensembles. The book is divided into five chapters: First, a brief introduction to statistical methods. Second, the statistical description of isolated systems, corresponding to microcanonical ensembles. Third, the statistical description of systems in contact with a heat reservoir at a constant temperature T, known as the canonical ensemble. Fourth, the description of systems in contact with a heat reservoir at temperature T and with a constant chemical potential {\mu}; the grand canonical ensemble. And finally, quantum statistics. In each chapter, a theoretical description, worked examples, links to simulations (see GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidalejandromiranda/StatisticalPhysics) and discussions on recent scientific reports will be presented so readers can complement their studies.</description>

      <title>Flat or crumpled: states of active symmetric membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up and study the hydrodynamic theory for active fluid and tethered membranes. We focus on those membranes which are inversion-symmetric. We show that such membranes are either described by appropriate linear hydrodynamic equations, which are exact in the asymptotic long wavelength limit, giving stable flat phases with positional quasi long range orders, or be linearly unstable, implying crumpling of the membranes. We argue that in a such an active membrane thermal noises dominate over any active noises, and use it to calculate the correlation functions of the undulation and in-plane displacements of the membrane in the stable case, and the associated correlation functions of the embedding bulk flow velocities.</description>

      <title>Quantum perspective for the non-equilibrium fluctuation relation and its experimental testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the intial and final states. Testing these remarkable relations is currently restricted to classical systems or to simple quantum systems whose energy state can be directly measured. Here we introduce the concept of a quantum work agent in thermodynamic processes, and suggest that it can allow to probe NFTs in general quantum systems. We elaborate on a simple model in the framework of mesoscopic systems, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Hierarchy and Thermalization Frustration in Graphene Nanoresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the essential cause of the intrinsic dissipation that limits the quality of graphene nanoresonators, intermodal energy transfer is also a key issue in thermalization dynamics. Typically systems with larger initial energy demand shorter time to be thermalized. However, we find quantitatively that instead of becoming shorter, the equipartition time of the graphene nanoresonator can increase abruptly by one order of magnitude. This thermalization frustration emerges due to the partition of the normal modes based on the hierarchical symmetry, and a sensitive on-off switching of the energy flow channels between symmetry classes controlled by Mathieu instabilities. The results uncover the decisive roles of symmetry in the thermalization at the nanoscale, and may also lead to strategies for improving the performance of graphene nanoresonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we modify the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilt on the noise (that is have non-linearly coupled noise). We introduce ghost Martin-Siggia-Rose (gMSR) action for the KPZ equation with Faddeev-Popov ghosts to compute an auxiliary functional determinant. We integrate out the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to leading order and the auxiliary MSR Lagrange multiplierexactly to obtain and action for the height. We analyze it within the gaussian, meanfield and Landau free energy like approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces.</description>

      <title>Rapid state-recrossing kinetics in non-Markovian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) is one standard measure for the reaction time in thermally activated barrier-crossing processes. While the relationship between MFPTs and phenomenological rate coefficients is known for systems that satisfy Markovian dynamics, it is not clear how to interpret MFPTs for experimental and simulation time-series data generated by non-Markovian systems. Here, we simulate a one-dimensional generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in a bistable potential and compare two related numerical methods for evaluating MFPTs: one that only incorporates information about first arrivals between subsequent states and is equivalent to calculating the waiting time, or dwell time, and one that incorporates information about all first-passages associated with a given barrier-crossing event and is therefore typically employed to enhance numerical sampling. In the Markovian limit, the two methods are equivalent. However, for significant memory times, the two methods suggest dramatically different reaction kinetics. By focusing on first-passage distributions, we systematically reveal the influence of memory-induced rapid state-recrossing on the MFPTs, which we compare to various other numerical or theoretical descriptions of reaction times. Overall, we demonstrate that it is necessary to consider full first-passage distributions, rather than just the mean barrier-crossing kinetics when analyzing non-Markovian time series data.</description>

      <title>Mapping a dissipative quantum spin chain onto a generalized Coulomb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An XXZ spin chain at zero magnetization is subject to spatially correlated baths acting as dissipation. We show that the low-energy excitations of this model are described by a dissipative sine-Gordon field theory, i.e. a sine-Gordon action with an additional long-range interaction emerging from dissipation. The field theory is then exactly mapped onto a generalized Coulomb gas which, in addition to the usual integer charges, displays half-integer charges that originate from the dissipative baths. These new charges come in pairs linked by a charge-independent logarithmic interaction. In the Coulomb gas picture, we identify a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like phase transition corresponding to the binding of charges and derive the associated perturbative renormalization group equations. For superohmic baths, the transition is due to the binding of the integer charges, while for subohmic baths, it is due to the binding of the half-integer charges, thereby signaling a dissipation-induced transition.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence in long-range quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$ microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that in the canonical ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) setups are delineated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective interactions that violate Newton's third law of action-reaction symmetry are common in systems where interactions are mediated by a non-equilibrium environment. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out on a two-dimensional Ising model, where the interactions are modified non-reciprocally. We demonstrate that the critical temperature decreases as the non-reciprocity increases and this decrease depends only on the magnitude of non-reciprocity. Further, travelling spin waves due to the local fluctuations in magnetisation are observed and these spin waves travel opposite to the non-reciprocity vector.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation of a leader by the increasing number of followers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the connected two-time correlator of the maximum $M_N(t)$ of $N$ independent Gaussian stochastic processes (GSP) characterised by a common correlation coefficient $\rho$ that depends on the two times $t_1$ and $t_2$. We show analytically that this correlator, for fixed times $t_1$ and $t_2$, decays for large $N$ as a power law $N^{-\gamma}$ (with logarithmic corrections) with a decorrelation exponent $\gamma = (1-\rho)/(1+ \rho)$ that depends only on $\rho$, but otherwise is universal for any GSP. We study several examples of physical processes including the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst exponent $H$ and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. For the fBm, $\rho$ is only a function of $\tau = \sqrt{t_1/t_2}$ and we find an interesting ``freezing'' transition at a critical value $\tau= \tau_c=(3-\sqrt{5})/2$. For $\tau &lt; \tau_c$, there is an optimal $H^*(\tau) &gt; 0$ that maximises the exponent $\gamma$ and this maximal value freezes to $\gamma= 1/3$ for $\tau &gt;\tau_c$. For the OU process, we show that $\gamma = {\rm tanh}(\mu \,|t_1-t_2|/2)$ where $\mu$ is the stiffness of the harmonic trap. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality under imperfect teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement, measurement, and classical communication together enable teleportation of quantum states between distant parties, in principle with perfect fidelity. To what extent do correlations and entanglement of a many-body wavefunction transfer under imperfect teleportation protocols? We address this question for the case of an imperfectly teleported quantum critical wavefunction, focusing on the ground state of a critical Ising chain. We demonstrate that imperfections, e.g., in the entangling gate adopted for a given protocol, effectively manifest as weak measurements acting on the otherwise pristinely teleported critical state. Armed with this perspective, we leverage and further develop the theory of measurement-altered quantum criticality to quantify the resilience of critical-state teleportation. We identify classes of teleportation protocols for which imperfection $(i)$ preserves both the universal long-range entanglement and correlations of the original quantum critical state, $(ii)$ weakly modifies these quantities away from their universal values, and $(iii)$ obliterates long-range entanglement altogether while preserving power-law correlations, albeit with a new set of exponents. We also show that mixed states describing the average over a series of sequential imperfect teleportation events retain pristine power-law correlations due to a `built-in' decoding algorithm, though their entanglement structure measured by the negativity depends on errors similarly to individual protocol runs. These results may allow one to design teleportation protocols that optimize against errors -- highlighting a potential practical application of measurement-altered criticality.</description>

Abstract: The behaviour of the solutions of the time-fractional diffusion equation, based on the Caputo derivative, is studied and its dependence on the fractional exponent is analysed. The time-fractional convection-diffusion equation is also solved and an application to Pennes bioheat model is presented. Generically, a wave-like transport at short times passes over to a diffusion-like behaviour at later times.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theories of state- and generation-dependent cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a general, high-dimensional kinetic theory describing the internal state (such as gene expression or protein levels) of cells in a stochastically evolving population. The resolution of our kinetic theory also allows one to track subpopulations associated with each generation. Both intrinsic noise of the cell's internal attribute and randomness in a cell's division times (demographic stochasticity) are fundamental to the development of our model. Based on this general framework, we are able to marginalize the high-dimensional kinetic PDEs in a number of different ways to derive equations that describe the dynamics of marginalized or "macroscopic" quantities such as structured population densities, moments of generation-dependent cellular states, and moments of the total population. We also show how nonlinear "interaction" terms in lower-dimensional integrodifferential equations can arise from high-dimensional linear kinetic models that contain rate parameters of a cell (birth and death rates) that depend on variables associated with other cells, generating couplings in the dynamics. Our analysis provides a general, more complete mathematical framework that resolves the coevolution of cell populations and cell states. The approach may be tailored for studying, e.g., gene expression in developing tissues, or other more general particle systems which exhibit Brownian noise in individual attributes and population-level demographic noise.</description>

      <title>Migration and separation of polymers in non-uniform active baths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer-like structures are ubiquitous in nature and synthetic materials. Their configurational and migration properties are often affected by crowded environments leading to non-thermal fluctuations. Here, we study an ideal Rouse chain in contact with a non-homogeneous active bath, characterized by the presence of active self-propelled agents which exert time-correlated forces on the chain. By means of a coarse-graining procedure, we derive an effective evolution for the center of mass of the chain and show its tendency to migrate towards and preferentially localize in regions of high/low bath activity depending on the model parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that an active bath with non-uniform activity can be used to separate efficiently polymeric species with different lengths and/or connectivity.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral for Chord Diagrams and Chaotic-Integrable Transitions in Double Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study transitions from chaotic to integrable Hamiltonians in the double scaled SYK and $p$-spin systems. The dynamics of our models is described by chord diagrams with two species. We begin by developing a path integral formalism of coarse graining chord diagrams with a single species of chords, which has the same equations of motion as the bi-local ($G\Sigma$) Liouville action, yet appears otherwise to be different and in particular well defined. We then develop a similar formalism for two types of chords, allowing us to study different types of deformations of double scaled SYK and in particular a deformation by an integrable Hamiltonian. The system has two distinct thermodynamic phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic SYK Hamiltonian, the other is continuously connected to the integrable Hamiltonian, separated at low temperature by a first order phase transition. We also analyze the phase diagram for generic deformations, which in some cases includes a zero-temperature phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish three equivalent versions of a Parisi formula for the free energy of mean-field spin glasses in a transversal magnetic field. These results are derived from available results for classical vector spin glasses by an approximation method using the functional integral representation of the partition function. In this approach, the order parameter is a non-decreasing function with values in the non-negative, real hermitian Hilbert-Schmidt operators. For the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, we also show that under the assumption of self-averaging of the self-overlap, the optimising Parisi order parameter is found within a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the self-overlap and the fully stationary overlap.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Pseudo-Random Number Generators in QMC-SSE Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method, the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) plays a crucial role in determining the computation time. However, the hidden structure of the PRNG may lead to serious issues such as the breakdown of the Markov process. Here, we systematically analyze the performance of the different PRNGs on the widely used QMC method -- stochastic series expansion (SSE) algorithm. To quantitatively compare them, we introduce a quantity called QMC efficiency that can effectively reflect the efficiency of the algorithms. After testing several representative observables of the Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, we recommend using LCG as the best choice of PRNGs. Our work can not only help improve the performance of the SSE method but also shed light on the other Markov-chain-based numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Unconventional topological mixed-state transition and critical phase induced by self-dual coherent errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological phase can undergo a phase transition driven by anyon condensation. A potential obstruction to such a mechanism could arise if there exists a symmetry between anyons that have non-trivial mutual statistics. Here we consider toric code subjected to errors that tend to proliferate anyons with non-trivial mutual statistics. Using triangle inequality, we show that in the presence of electromagnetic duality and a partial-transpose symmetry, a decoherence induced phase transition out of the topological phase must be rather unconventional and lie beyond standard rules of anyon condensation. To explore such physics, we first subject toric code to a self-dual quantum channel where Kraus operators are proportional to X+Z. We find that the topological phase is stable up to the maximal error rate, when viewing density matrix as a pure state in the double Hilbert space. To access an unconventional transition, we then consider a perturbed toric code subjected to the self-dual channel, and find numerical evidence that beyond a critical error rate, the topological phase is destroyed resulting in a critical phase where anyons are only power-law condensed.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise: Higher-order physical interactions affect phase separation in multi-component liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation, crucial for spatially segregating biomolecules in cells, is well-understood in the simple case of a few components with pairwise interactions. Yet, biological cells challenge the simple picture in at least two ways: First, biomolecules, like proteins and nucleic acids, exhibit complex, higher-order interactions, where a single molecule may interact with multiple others simultaneously. Second, cells comprise a myriad of different components that form various droplets. Such multicomponent phase separation has been studied in the simple case of pairwise interactions, but an analysis of higher-order interactions is lacking. We propose such a theory and study the corresponding phase diagrams numerically. We find that interactions between three components are similar to pairwise interactions, whereas composition-dependent higher-order interactions between two components can oppose phase separation. This surprising result can only be revealed from the equilibrium phase diagrams, implying that the often-used stability analysis of homogeneous states is inadequate to study these systems. We thus show that higher-order interactions could play a crucial role in forming droplets in cells, and their manipulation could offer novel approaches to controlling multicomponent phase separation.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced transitions past the onset of a steady symmetry-breaking bifurcation: the case of the sudden expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fluid flows, governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, subject to a steady symmetry-breaking bifurcation and forced by a weak noise acting on a slow time scale. By generalizing the multiple-scale weakly nonlinear expansion technique employed in the literature for the response of the Duffing oscillator, we rigorously derive a stochastically forced Stuart-Landau equation for the dominant symmetry-breaking mode. The probability density function of the solution, and of the escape time from one attractor to the other, are then determined by solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation. The validity of this reduced order model is tested on the flow past a sudden expansion, for a given Reynolds number and different noise amplitudes. At a very low numerical cost, the statistics obtained from the amplitude equation accurately reproduce those of long-time direct numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: This work studies exact solvability of a class of fractional reaction-diffusion equation with the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives on the half-line in terms of the similarity solutions. We derived the conditions for the equation to possess scaling symmetry even with the fractional derivatives. Relations among the scaling exponents are determined, and the appropriate similarity variable introduced. With the similarity variable we reduced the stochastic partial differential equation to a fractional ordinary differential equation. Exactly solvable systems are then identified by matching the resulted ordinary differential equation with the known exactly solvable fractional ones. Several examples involving the three-parameter Mittag-Leffler function (Kilbas-Saigo function) are presented. The models discussed here turn out to correspond to superdiffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in the computational complexity of the shortest common superstring and genome assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genome assembly, the process of reconstructing a long genetic sequence by aligning and merging short fragments, or reads, is known to be NP-hard, either as a version of the shortest common superstring problem or in a Hamiltonian-cycle formulation. That is, the computing time is believed to grow exponentially with the the problem size in the worst case. Despite this fact, high-throughput technologies and modern algorithms currently allow bioinformaticians to handle datasets of billions of reads. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we address this conundrum by demonstrating the existence of a phase transition in the computational complexity of the problem and showing that practical instances always fall in the 'easy' phase (solvable by polynomial-time algorithms). In addition, we propose a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministic algorithms in the hard regime.</description>

Abstract: We extend previous results providing an exact formula for the variance of a linear statistic for the Jellium model, a one-dimensional model of Statistical mechanics obtained from the $k \longrightarrow 0^{+}$ limit of the Dyson log-gas. For such a computation of the covariance, in comparison to previous work for computations of the log-gas covariance, we obtain a formula between two linear statistics, given arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$ over the real line, that is dependent upon an asymptotic approximation of the Jellium probability distribution function from large $N$ deviations, and from an effective saddle-point action.</description>

Abstract: In fluid mechanics, dimensionless numbers like the Reynolds number help classify flows. We argue that such a classification is also relevant for crowd flows by putting forward the dimensionless Intrusion and Avoidance numbers.Using an extensive dataset, we show that these delineate regimes that are characterized by distinct structural signatures, best probed in terms of distances at low Avoidance number and times-to-collision at low Intrusion number.These findings prompt a perturbative expansion of the agent-based dynamics; the generic models thus obtained perform well in (and only in) the regime in which they were derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation is frequently utilised to rewrite quantum spin chains in terms of fermionic operators. When the resulting Hamiltonian is bilinear in these fermions, i.e. the fermions are free, the exact spectrum follows from the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows only linearly with the volume of the system. However, several Hamiltonians that do not admit a Jordan-Wigner transformation to fermion bilinears still have the same type of free-fermion spectra. The spectra of such ``free fermions in disguise" models can be found exactly by an intricate but explicit construction of the raising and lowering operators. We generalise the methods further to find a family of such spin chains. We compute the exact spectrum, and generalise an elegant graph-theory construction. We also explain how this family admits an N=2 lattice supersymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take the paradigm of interacting spin chains, the Heisenberg spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ model, as a reference system and consider interacting models that are related to it by Jordan-Wigner transformations and restrictions to sub-chains. An example is the fermionic analogue of the gapless XXZ Hamiltonian, which, in a continuum scaling limit, is described by the massless Thirring model. We work out the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies of disjoint blocks in the ground state and extract the universal scaling functions describing the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information in the limit of infinite lengths. We consider also the von Neumann entropy, but only in the limit of large distance. We show how to use the entropies of spin blocks to unveil the spin structures of the underlying massless Thirring model. Finally, we speculate about the tripartite information after global quenches and conjecture its asymptotic behaviour in the limit of infinite time and small quench. The resulting conjecture for the ``residual tripartite information'', which corresponds to the limit in which the intervals' lengths are infinitely larger than their (large) distance, supports the claim of universality recently made studying noninteracting spin chains. Our mild assumptions imply that the residual tripartite information after a small quench of the anisotropy in the gapless phase of XXZ is equal to $-\log 2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermodynamic properties of spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ladders by means of the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo technique. This includes the thermal properties of the specific heat, uniform and staggered susceptibilities, spin gap, and structure factor. Our numerical simulations are probed over a large ensemble of random realizations in a wide range of disorder strengths $r$, from the clean ($r=0$) case up to the diluted ($r \rightarrow 1$) limit, and for selected choices of number of legs $L_y$ per site. Our results show some interesting phenomena, like the presence of crossing points in the temperature plane for both the specific heat and uniform susceptibility curves which appear to be universal in $r$, as well as a variable dependence of the spin gap in the amount of disorder upon increasing $L_y$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading conjecture for the emergence of statistical mechanics in generic isolated quantum systems and is formulated in terms of the matrix elements of operators. An analog known as the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that entanglement velocities, which govern the spreading of entanglement, are encoded in higher correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known dynamical property of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents concentration inequalities that provide lower bounds on the probability distributions of observables in quantum and classical Markov processes. These lower bounds incorporate the dynamical activity, a central thermodynamic quantity in tradeoff relations. By combining the obtained concentration inequalities with the Markov inequality, we derive upper bounds on the expectation value of an observable given its maximum value. Furthermore, we obtain generalized versions of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, where the first and second moments of the original relation are replaced by the $p$-norm. These tradeoff relations hold for arbitrary time-independent quantum and classical Markov processes, regardless of the initial state. The concentration inequalities derived in this paper lay the foundation for discovering new tradeoff relations in quantum and classical nonequilibrium processes.</description>

      <title>Reclaiming the Lost Conformality in a non-Hermitian Quantum 5-state Potts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal symmetry, emerging at critical points, can be lost when renormalization group fixed points collide. Recently, it was proposed that after collisions, real fixed points transition into the complex plane, becoming complex fixed points described by complex conformal field theories (CFTs). Although this idea is compelling, directly demonstrating such complex conformal fixed points in microscopic models remains highly demanding. Furthermore, these concrete models are instrumental in unraveling the mysteries of complex CFTs and illuminating a variety of intriguing physical problems, including weakly first-order transitions in statistical mechanics and the conformal window of gauge theories. In this work, we have successfully addressed this complex challenge for the (1+1)-dimensional quantum $5$-state Potts model, whose phase transition has long been known to be weakly first-order. By adding an additional non-Hermitian interaction, we successfully identify two conjugate critical points located in the complex parameter space, where the lost conformality is restored in a complex manner. Specifically, we unambiguously demonstrate the radial quantization of the complex CFTs and compute the operator spectrum, as well as new operator product expansion coefficients that were previously unknown.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Transition of Operator Size Growth in Quantum Systems Embedded in an Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In closed generic many-body systems, unitary evolution disperses local quantum information into highly non-local objects, resulting in thermalization. Such a process is called information scrambling, whose swiftness is quantified by the operator size growth. However, for quantum systems embedded in an environment, how the couplings to the environment affect the process of information scrambling quests revelation. Here we predict a dynamical transition in quantum systems with all-to-all interactions accompanied by an environment, which separates two phases. In the dissipative phase, information scrambling halts as the operator size decays with time, while in the scrambling phase, dispersion of information persists and the operator size grows and saturates to an $O(N)$ value in the long-time limit with $N$ the number of degrees of freedom of the systems. The transition is driven by the competition between the system intrinsic and environment propelled scramblings and the environment induced dissipation. Our prediction is derived from a general argument based on epidemiological models and demonstrated analytically via solvable Brownian SYK models. We provide further evidence which suggests that the transition is generic to quantum chaotic systems when coupled to an environment. Our study sheds light on the fundamental behavior of quantum systems in the presence of an environment.</description>

      <title>Tunable tachyon mass in the PT-broken massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the full phase diagram of a non-Hermitian PT-symmetric generalization of the paradigmatic two-dimensional massive Thirring model. Employing the non-perturbative functional renormalization-group, we find that the model hosts a regime where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. This new phase is characterized by a relevant imaginary mass, corresponding to monstronic excitations displaying exponentially growing amplitudes for time-like intervals and tachyonic (Lieb-Robison-bound breaking, oscillatory) excitations for space-like intervals. Furthermore, since the phase manifests itself as an unconventional attractive spinodal fixed point, which is typically unreachable in finite real-life systems, we find that the effective renormalized mass reached can be tuned through the microscopic parameters of the model. Our results further predict that the new phase is robust to external gauge fields, contrary to the celebrated BKT phase in the PT unbroken sector. The gauge field then provides an effective and easy means to tune the renormalized imaginary mass through a wide range of values, and therefore the amplitude growth/oscillation rate of the corresponding excitations.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that electron-phonon interactions enhance the stability of charge density waves in low-temperature phases of many-electron systems. Our proof method involves an appropriate application of the Pirogov--Sinai theory to electron-phonon systems. Combining our findings with existing results, we obtain rigorous information regarding the low-temperature phase diagram for half-filled electron-phonon systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and entanglement for two dimensional long-range Heisenberg bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum criticality and entanglement in systems with long-range (LR) interactions is still in its early stages, with many open questions remaining. In this work, we investigate critical exponents and scaling of entanglement entropies (EE) in the LR bilayer Heisenberg model using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and the recently developed nonequilibrium increment algorithm for measuring EE. By applying modified (standard) finite-size scaling (FSS) above (below) the upper critical dimension and field theory analysis, we obtain precise critical exponents in three regimes: the LR Gaussian regime with a Gaussian fixed point, the short-range (SR) regime with Wilson-Fisher (WF) exponents, and a LR non-Gaussian regime where the critical exponents vary continuously from LR Gaussian to SR values. We compute the R\'enyi EE both along the critical line and in the N\'eel phase and observe that as the LR interaction is enhanced, the area-law contribution in EE gradually vanishes both at quantum critical points (QCPs) and in the N\'eel phase. The log-correction in EE arising from sharp corners at the QCPs also decays to zero as LR interaction grows, whereas the log-correction for N\'eel states, caused by the interplay of Goldstone modes and restoration of the symmetry in a finite system, is enhanced as LR interaction becomes stronger. We also discuss relevant experimental settings to detect these nontrivial properties in critical behavior and entanglement information for quantum many-body systems with LR interactions.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Lifshitz-type Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate various aspects of the Lanczos coefficients in a family of free Lifshitz scalar theories, characterized by their integer dynamical exponent, at finite temperature. In this non-relativistic setup, we examine the effects of mass, finite ultraviolet cutoff, and finite lattice spacing on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients. We also investigate the effect of the dynamical exponent on the asymptotic behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, which show a universal scaling behavior. We carefully examine how these results can affect different measures in Krylov space, including Krylov complexity and entropy. Remarkably, we find that our results are similar to those previously observed in the literature for relativistic theories.</description>

      <title>The impact of microscale physics in continuous time random walks for hydrodynamic dispersion in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach has been widely applied to model large-scale non-Fickian transport in the flow through disordered media. Often, the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms and disorder characteristics are not known, and their effect on large-scale solute dispersion is encoded by a heavy-tailed transition time distribution. Here we study how the microscale physics manifests in the CTRW framework, and how it affects solute dispersion. To this end, we consider transport in disordered media with random sorption and random flow properties. Both disorder mechanisms can give rise to anomalous particle transport. We present the CTRW models corresponding to each of these physical scenarios to discuss the different manifestations of microscale heterogeneity on large-scale dispersion depending on the particle injection modes. The combined impact of random sorption and advection is studied with a novel CTRW model that explicitly represents both microscale disorder mechanisms. While random advection and sorption may show similar large-scale transport behaviors, they can be clearly distinguished in their response to uniform injection conditions, and, in general, to initial particle distributions that are not flux-weighted. These findings highlight the importance of the microscale physics for the interpretation and prediction of anomalous dispersion phenomena in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Voronoi Tessellations as Models for Cellular Neighborhoods in Simple Multicellular Organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on distinct multicellular organisms has revealed a hitherto unknown type of biological noise; rather than a regular arrangement, cellular neighborhood volumes, obtained by Voronoi tessellations of the cell locations, are broadly distributed and consistent with gamma distributions. We propose an explanation for those observations in the case of the alga $Volvox$, whose somatic cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) they export. Both a solvable one-dimensional model of ECM growth derived from bursty transcriptional activity and a two-dimensional "Voronoi liquid" model are shown to provide one-parameter families that smoothly interpolate between the empirically-observed near-maximum-entropy gamma distributions and the crystalline limit of Gaussian distributions governed by the central limit theorem. These results highlight a universal consequence of intrinsic biological noise on the architecture of certain tissues.</description>

      <title>The $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Green's functions $G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ and their self-consistent equations admit analytic continuations to complex $n$. The indeterminacy of bootstrap problems can be resolved by the principle of minimal singularity. We use the harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the bootstrap analysis, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we revisit the $\phi^n$ trajectories at non-integer $n$ by the standard wave function formulation. The results are in agreement with the minimally singular solutions. Using the matching procedure, we obtain accurate solutions for anharmonic oscillators with higher powers. In particular, the existence of $G_n$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant oscillators with non-integer powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a method for calculating holographic duals of BCFTs with more than two boundaries. We apply it to calculating the dynamics of entanglement entropy in a 1+1d CFT that is instantaneously split into multiple segments and calculate the entanglement entropy as a function of time for the case of two splits, showing that our approach reproduces earlier results for the double split case. Our manuscript lays the groundwork for future calculations of the entanglement entropy for more than two splits and systems at nonzero temperature.</description>
