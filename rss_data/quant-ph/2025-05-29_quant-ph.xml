      <title>Pauli Propagation: A Computational Framework for Simulating Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical methods to simulate quantum systems are not only a key element of the physicist's toolkit for studying many-body models but are also increasingly important for verifying and challenging upcoming quantum computers. Pauli propagation has recently emerged as a promising new family of classical algorithms for simulating digital quantum systems. Here we provide a comprehensive account of Pauli propagation, tracing its algorithmic structure from its bit-level implementation and formulation as a tree-search problem, all the way to its high-level user applications for simulating quantum circuits and dynamics. Utilising these observations, we present PauliPropagation.jl, a Julia software package that can perform rapid Pauli propagation simulation straight out-of-the-box and can be used more generally as a building block for novel simulation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear superconducting ring resonator for sensitive measurement of time reversal symmetry broken order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) has been central to detecting exotic phases of matter, often linked to complex superconducting order parameters or unique magnetic phenomena. Here, we leverage circuit electrodynamics capabilities of superconducting devices to propose a novel scheme based on a multimode superconducting ring resonator for sensitive probing of TRSB in quantum materials. Our device enables strong nonlinear interactions between the modes and we show that these interactions can lead to highly symmetric configurations which are sensitive to TRSB. Using a driven-dissipative model, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of a two-mode superconducting circuit with self- and cross-Kerr nonlinearities under conditions near the bifurcation threshold. When TRSB coupling is introduced, the critical behavior of the system serves as a highly sensitive detection method. Specifically, by mapping out the optimal parameter regimes, we show that even when the photon occupation numbers are subjected to different initial conditions, they can be driven into a symmetric configuration which can be broken even with weak TRSB. Our findings highlight the utility of superconducting microwave resonators other than quantum information processing as a tool for probing exotic states of matter.</description>

      <title>From simulatability to universality of continuous-variable quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged.) Quantum computers promise to solve some problems exponentially faster than traditional computers, but we still do not fully understand why this is the case. While the most studied model of quantum computation uses qubits, which are the quantum equivalent of a classical bit, an alternative method for building quantum computers is gaining traction. Continuous-variable devices, with their infinite range of measurement outcomes, use systems such as electromagnetic fields. Given this infinite-dimensional structure, combined with the complexities of quantum physics, we are left with a natural question: when are continuous-variable quantum computers more powerful than classical devices? This thesis investigates this question by exploring the boundary of which circuits are classically simulatable and which unlock a quantum advantage over classical computers. A series of proofs are presented demonstrating the efficient simulatability of progressively more complex circuits, even those with high amounts of Wigner negativity. Specifically, circuits initiated with highly Wigner-negative Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, which form a grid-like structure in phase space, can be simulated in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Designing Fault-Tolerant Blind Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind quantum computing (BQC) is a computational paradigm that allows a client with limited quantum capabilities to delegate quantum computations to a more powerful server while keeping both the algorithm and data hidden. However, in practice, existing BQC protocols face significant challenges when scaling to large-scale computations due to photon losses, low efficiencies, and high overheads associated with fault-tolerant operations, requiring the client to compile both logical operations and error correction primitives. We use a recently demonstrated hybrid light-matter approach [PRL 132, 150604 (2024); Science 388, 509-513 (2025)] to develop an architecture for scalable fault-tolerant blind quantum computation. By combining high-fidelity local gates on the server's matter qubits with delegated blind rotations using photons, we construct loss-tolerant delegated gates that enable efficient algorithm compilation strategies and a scalable approach for fault-tolerant blind logical algorithms. Our approach improves the error-correction threshold and increases the speed and depth of blind logical circuits. Finally, we outline how this architecture can be implemented on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, including neutral atom arrays and solid-state spin defects. These new capabilities open up new opportunities for deep circuit blind quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Complex and tunable heating in conformal field theories with structured drives via classical ergodicity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission and absorption of energy are fundamental aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics. The heating induced by driving a many-body system is perhaps the most straightforward diagnostic of the process of equilibration, or the lack thereof. Gapless systems are particularly susceptible to drive-induced heating, and the capacity to control such heating is of experimental importance. Our study addresses this challenge in the framework of conformal field theory (CFT), for which we study families of structured drives up to the aperiodic Thue-Morse sequence. Concretely, we consider a class of spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, where the operator evolution is governed by a non-linear classical dynamical system $\mathcal{K}$. The existence of invariant regions and fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$ leads to different levels of ergodicity breaking. Upon bridging the gap between this dynamical system and the driven CFT, we classify various dynamical phases of matter, including the heating and non-heating phases, as well as a prethermal phase with a controllably slow heating rate. We further generalize the discussion to $\eta-$random multipolar driving, characterized by $\eta-$th order multipolar correlation in time. A ``triply tunable'' parametric dependence of the prethermal lifetime arises as $K^{-2(\eta-\xi)}$, where $K$ quantifies the deviation from the preimages of the fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$, the multipolar order $\eta$, and the order of the preimages $\xi$. Upon sacrificing Hermiticity by considering SU(2) deformed CFTs, we find another non-heating phase with a non-zero measure, inaccessible via purely unitary CFTs. This is underpinned by an emergent compact subspace in the generic $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ group structure, which we also identify in the transfer matrix in non-Hermitian systems with binary disorder.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon QKD for Practical Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) will most likely be an integral part of any practical quantum network in the future. However, not all QKD protocols can be used in today's networks because of the lack of single-photon emitters and noisy intermediate quantum hardware. Attenuated-photon transmission, typically used to simulate single-photon emitters, severely limits the achievable transmission distances and makes the integration of the QKD into existing classical networks, that use tens of thousands of photons per bit of transmission, difficult. Furthermore, it has been found that protocol performance varies with topology. In order to remove the reliance of QKD on single-photon emitters and increase transmission distances, it is worthwhile to explore QKD protocols that do not rely on single-photon transmissions for security, such as the 3-stage QKD protocol, which can tolerate multiple photons in each burst without information leakage. This paper compares and contrasts the 3-stage QKD protocol with conventional QKD protocols and its efficiency in different network topologies and conditions. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical relationship between achievable key rates to increase transmission distances in various topologies.</description>

      <title>Events and their Localisation are Relative to a Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of events and their localisation fundamentally differ between quantum theory and general relativity, reconciling them becomes even more important and challenging in the context of quantum gravity where a classical spacetime background can no longer be assumed. We therefore propose an operational approach drawing from quantum information, to define events and their localisation relative to a Lab, which in particular includes a choice of physical degree of freedom (the reference) providing a generalised notion of "location". We define a property of the reference, relative measurability, that is sensitive to correlations between the Lab's reference and objects of study. Applying this proposal to analyse the quantum switch (QS), a process widely associated with indefinite causal order, we uncover differences between classical and quantum spacetime realisations of QS, rooted in the relative measurability of the associated references and possibilities for agents' interventions. Our analysis also clarifies a longstanding debate on the interpretation of QS experiments, demonstrating how different conclusions stem from distinct assumptions on the Labs. This provides a foundation for a more unified view of events, localisation, and causality across quantum and relativistic domains.</description>

      <title>Global-Local Duality of Energetic Control Cost in Multipartite Quantum Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite quantum correlated systems (MQCSs) are widely utilized in diverse quantum information tasks, where their sophisticated control inherently incurs energetic costs. However, the fundamental characteristics of these control costs remain elusive, largely due to the lack of thermodynamic descriptions capable of capturing the full complexities of MQCSs. Here, we uncover universal thermodynamic relations for arbitrary MQCSs weakly coupled to a thermal bath, establishing an intrinsic global-local duality of control costs. Using these relations, we elucidate the exact role of multipartite correlation--a defining quantum feature of MQCSs--in shaping control costs at finite times. We also demonstrate that the relative magnitude between global and local control costs is undetermined, which perplexes the cost management of MQCSs under finite-time controls. Our results are numerically corroborated with applications to experimentally realizable multi-qubit systems undergoing finite-time qubit reset processes.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Entanglement dynamics: the influence of intrinsic decoherence and decoherence channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines a system of three coupled qubits, focusing on entanglement measures in the presence of decoherence. It utilizes an XXZ Heisenberg chain with an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, considering intrinsic decoherence. The results reveal that only the magnetic field strength affects entanglement, while intrinsic decoherence suppresses it, with stronger decoherence leading to greater suppression. Various decoherence channels are analyzed, showing that the $I$-tangle typically decreases with increased decoherence, except for the generalized W state under phase damping channel, where only one qubit is affected. Interestingly, dark periods of $I$-tangle occur for the GHZ state under non-Markovian dephasing, and while steady-state entanglement disappears in this channel, it remains nonzero when starting from a mixture of GHZ and fully separable states. Additionally, under generalized amplitude damping channel, reduced bipartite states of a W state exhibit entanglement sudden death, while the steady-state $I$-tangle for the spectral decomposed state stays nonzero.</description>

      <title>SAT Strikes Back: Parameter and Path Relations in Quantum Toolchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the foreseeable future, toolchains for quantum computing should offer automatic means of transforming a high level problem formulation down to a hardware executable form. Thereby, it is crucial to find (multiple) transformation paths that are optimised for (hardware specific) metrics. We zoom into this pictured tree of transformations by focussing on k-SAT instances as input and their transformation to QUBO, while considering structure and characteristic metrics of input, intermediate and output representations. Our results can be used to rate valid paths of transformation in advance -- also in automated (quantum) toolchains. We support the automation aspect by considering stability and therefore predictability of free parameters and transformation paths. Moreover, our findings can be used in the manifesting era of error correction (since considering structure in a high abstraction layer can benefit error correcting codes in layers below). We also show that current research is closely linked to quadratisation techniques and their mathematical foundation.</description>

      <title>Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system.
  Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) are determined by the "diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the "off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <title>Symmetry reduction for testing $k$-block-positivity via extendibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of testing $k$-block-positivity via symmetric $N$-extendibility by taking the tensor product with a $k$-dimensional maximally entangled state. We exploit the unitary symmetry of the maximally entangled state to reduce the size of the corresponding semidefinite programs (SDP). For example, for $k=2$, the SDP is reduced from one block of size $2^{N+1} d^{N+1}$ to $\lfloor \frac{N+1}{2} \rfloor$ blocks of size $\approx O( (N-1)^{-1} 2^{N+1} d^{N+1} )$.</description>

      <title>Interpolation of Quantum Polar Codes and Quantum Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Good quantum error-correcting codes that fulfill practical considerations, such as simple encoding circuits and efficient decoders, are essential for functional quantum information processing systems. Quantum polar codes satisfy some of these requirements but lack certain critical features, thereby hindering their widespread use. Existing constructions either require entanglement assistance to produce valid quantum codes, suffer from poor finite-size performance, or fail to tailor polar codes to the underlying channel properties. Meanwhile, quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes demonstrate strong performance, though no known efficient decoding algorithm exists for them. In this work, we propose strategies to interpolate between quantum polar codes and quantum RM codes, thus addressing the challenges of designing valid quantum polar codes without entanglement assistance and improving finite-size code performance.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous decay of an excited atom by photon emission is one of the most common and elementary physical process present in nature and in laboratories. The decay is random in time with constant probability density, as it can be inferred by the exponential law observed experimentally. Despite the simplicity of the process, in Quantum Mechanics the decay itself is considered a law of nature which is not further analyzed or explained. However it is legitimate to ask for the reason of its randomness and for the dynamics of the atom around the decay. The decay process of an isolated atom is usually assumed to be instantaneous, the so called Quantum jumps. Particular experimental arrangements can widen the duration of the transition from an excited state to the ground state to a finite time. In general this is due to the quantum back action of the detector. The development of Quantum Optics has enormously enriched the possibilities to study in detail the process, and new illuminating insights have been obtained, but the question is still valid and its answer is still elusive. In this paper we analyze the spontaneous decay within the new prospect introduced by a recent model that complete standard Quantum Mechanics in a formalism which is able to describe the dynamics of measurement and of spontaneous decay. Comparison is made with more phenomenological theories, the Quantum Mechanics of open system and the Stochastic wave function model. In the new model the stochastic photon emission by an excited atom is triggered by the vacuum fluctuations. It is suggested how to re-analyze three types of experiments, already realized in many laboratories, in order to reveal the presence and the effect of these fluctuations.</description>

      <title>2-Category of Topological Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary Ribbon Fusion Categories (URFC) formalize anyonic theories. It has been widely assumed that the same category formalizes a topological quantum computing model. However, in previous work, we addressed and resolved this confusion and demonstrated while the former could be any fusion category, the latter is always a subcategory of Hilb. In this paper, we argue that a categorical formalism that captures and unifies both anyonic theories (the Hardware of quantum computing) and a model of topological quantum computing is a braided (fusion) 2-category. In this 2-category, 0-morphisms describe anyonic types and Hom-categories describe different models of quantum computing. This picture provides an insightful perspective on superselection rules. It presents furthermore a clear distinction between fusion of anyons versus tensor products as defined in linear algebra, between vector spaces of 1-morphisms. The former represents a monoidal product and sum between 0-morphisms and the latter a tensor product and direct sum between 1-morphisms.</description>

      <title>Physics-inspired Generative AI models via real hardware-based noisy quantum diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Diffusion Models (QDMs) are an emerging paradigm in Generative AI that aims to use quantum properties to improve the performances of their classical counterparts. However, existing algorithms are not easily scalable due to the limitations of near-term quantum devices. Following our previous work on QDMs, here we propose and implement two physics-inspired protocols. In the first, we use the formalism of quantum stochastic walks, showing that a specific interplay of quantum and classical dynamics in the forward process produces statistically more robust models generating sets of MNIST images with lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) than using totally classical dynamics. In the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by exploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four qubits. Our work could be a starting point to pave the way for new scenarios for large-scale algorithms in quantum Generative AI, where quantum noise is neither mitigated nor corrected, but instead exploited as a useful resource.</description>

      <title>Benincasa-Dowker causal set actions by quantum counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal set theory is an approach to quantum gravity in which spacetime is fundamentally discrete while retaining local Lorentz invariance. The Benincasa--Dowker action is the causal set equivalent to the Einstein--Hilbert action underpinning Einstein's general theory of relativity. We present a $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ running-time quantum algorithm to compute the Benincasa--Dowker action in arbitrary spacetime dimensions for causal sets with $n$ elements which is asymptotically optimal and offers a polynomial speed up compared to all known classical or quantum algorithms. To do this, we prepare a uniform superposition over an $O(n^{2})$-size arbitrary subset of computational basis states encoding the classical description of a causal set of interest. We then construct $\tilde{O}(n)$-depth oracle circuits testing for different discrete volumes between pairs of causal set elements. Repeatedly performing a two-stage variant of quantum counting using these oracles yields the desired algorithm.</description>

      <title>Tight qubit uncertainty relations studied through weak values in neutron interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In its original formulation, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle describes a trade-off relation between the error of a quantum measurement and the thereby induced disturbance on the measured object. However, this relation is not valid in general. An alternative universally valid relation was derived by Ozawa in 2003, defining error and disturbance in a general concept, experimentally accessible via a tomographic method. Later, it was shown by Hall that these errors correspond to the statistical deviation between a physical property and its estimate. Recently, it was discovered that these errors can be observed experimentally when weak values are determined through a procedure named "feedback compensation". Here, we apply this procedure for the complete experimental characterization of the error-disturbance relation between a which-way observable in an interferometer and another observable associated with the output of the interferometer, confirming the theoretically predicted relation. As expected for pure states, the uncertainty is tightly fulfilled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) proved to be a versatile tool for generating tunable and stable frequency combs in the mid infrared range in the form of quantum walk combs. By homogeneously integrating a racetrack QCL with a passive waveguide, which lays on top of the active region plane and therefore can be designed to be fully independent from the laser geometry, we improve the light outcoupling from the ring by more than 2 orders of magnitude reaching a maximum output power of 120 mW. In addition, we show that it is possible to achieve quantum walk comb operation in the devices under analysis. Finally, we prove that we can change the light dispersion by tuning the parameters of the passive waveguide, with a direct impact on the behavior of the generated comb.</description>

Abstract: Position-momentum entanglement is a versatile high-dimensional resource in quantum optics. From fundamental tests of reality, to application in quantum technologies, spatial entanglement has had an increasing growth in recent years. In this review, we explore these advances, starting from the generation of spatial entanglement, followed by the different types of measurements for quantifying the entanglement, and finishing with different quantum-based applications. We conclude the review with a discussion and future perspectives on the field.</description>

      <title>Simulation of single hole spin qubit in strained triangular FinFET quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an in-house Schroedinger-Poisson (SP) solver, we investigate the creation of a single hole spin qubit inside a triple-gate triangular silicon fin field effect transistor (Si FinFET) quantum device similar to experimental structures. The gate induced formation of the required quantum dot (QD) is monitored based on the Luttinger-Kohn 6x6 kp method accounting for magnetic fields and strain to determine the qubit ground state. Strain arises from the inhomogeneous contraction of the different FinFET components when they are cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. It leads to a renormalization of the qubit energy levels, thus impacting both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) populations as well as their mixing. The dot length, band mixing, g-factor, and Larmor/Rabi frequencies of the considered device are extracted. In particular, we show that these metrics exhibit strong strain-dependent variations of their magnitude, thus underlying the importance of including realistic thermal contraction scenarios when modeling hole spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Low Crosstalk in a Scalable Superconducting Quantum Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits are a key platform for advancing quantum information processing and simulation. Scaling efforts currently encounter challenges such as Josephson-junction fabrication yield, design frequency targeting, and crosstalk arising both from spurious microwave modes and intrinsic interactions between qubits. We demonstrate a scalable 4x4 square lattice with low crosstalk, comprising 16 fixed-frequency transmon qubits with nearest-neighbor capacitive coupling that is implemented in a tileable, 3D-integrated circuit architecture with off-chip inductive shunting to mitigate spurious enclosure modes. We report on the design and comprehensive characterization, and show that our implementation achieves targeted device parameters with very low frequency spreads and simultaneous single-qubit gate errors across the device. Our results provide a promising pathway toward a scalable, low-crosstalk superconducting lattice topology with high qubit connectivity for quantum error correction and simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Tsirelson's Theorems via Approximate Schur's Lemma and Probabilistic Stampfli's Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tsirelson showed that, in finite dimensions, quantum correlations generated by commuting observables--measurements associated with distinct parties whose operators mutually commute--are equivalent to those obtainable from measurements on separate tensor product factors. We generalize this foundational result to the setting of $\epsilon$-almost commuting observables, establishing two distinct quantitative approximate Tsirelson's theorems. Both theorems show that if a $d$-dimensional bipartite quantum strategy's observables $\epsilon$-almost commute, then they are within $O(\mathrm{poly}(d) \epsilon)$ (in operator norm) of observables from a genuine tensor product strategy. This provides a quantitative counterpart to the asymptotic result of [N. Ozawa, J. Math. Phys. 54, 032202 (2013)] and justifies the tensor product model as an effective model even when subsystem independence is only approximately satisfied.
  Our theorems arise from two different but complementary formulations of almost commutation: (i) The first approach utilizes deterministic operator norm bounds relative to specific matrix generators (such as clock and shift matrices), leading to an approximate Schur's Lemma from which the first theorem directly follows. (ii) The second approach employs probabilistic bounds, requiring small commutators only on average against Haar-random single-qubit unitaries. This method yields two novel probabilistic Stampfli's theorems, quantifying distance to scalars based on probabilistic commutation, a result which may be of independent interest. These theorems set the basis for the second approximate Tsirelson's theorem.</description>

      <title>Calibrating quantum gates up to 52 qubits in a superconducting processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking large-scale quantum gates, typically involving multiple native two-qubit and singlequbit gates, is crucial in quantum computing. Global fidelity, encompassing information about intergate correlations, offers a comprehensive metric for evaluating and optimizing gate performance, unlike the fidelities of individual local native gates. In this work, utilizing the character-average benchmarking protocol implementable in a shallow circuit, we successfully benchmark gate fidelities up to 52 qubits. Notably, we achieved a fidelity of 63.09$\pm $0.23% for a 44-qubit parallel CZ gate. Utilizing the global fidelity of the parallel CZ gate, we explore the correlations among local CZ gates by introducing an inter-gate correlation metric, enabling one to simultaneously quantify crosstalk error when benchmarking gate fidelity. Finally, we apply our methods in gate optimization. By leveraging global fidelity for optimization, we enhance the fidelity of a 6-qubit parallel CZ gate from 87.65% to 92.04% and decrease the gate correlation from 3.53% to 3.22%, compared to local gate fidelitybased optimization. The experimental results align well with our established composite noise model, incorporating depolarizing and ZZ-coupling noises, and provide valuable insight into further study and mitigation of correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Configuration-dependent precision in magnetometry and thermometry using multi-qubit quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performance of quantum sensors composed of four qubits arranged in different geometries for magnetometry and thermometry. The qubits interact via the transverse-field Ising model with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, maintained in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath under an external magnetic field. Using quantum Fisher information (QFI), we evaluate the metrological precision of these sensors. For ferromagnetic couplings, weakly connected graphs (e.g., the chain graph, P_4) perform optimally in estimating weak magnetic fields, whereas highly connected graphs (e.g., the complete graph, K_4) excel at strong fields. Conversely, K_4 achieves the highest sensitivity for temperature estimation in the weak-field regime. In the antiferromagnetic case, we uncover a fundamental trade-off dictated by spectral degeneracy: configurations with non-degenerate energy spectra - such as the pan-like graph (three qubits in a triangle with the fourth attached) - exhibit strong magnetic field sensitivity due to their pronounced response to perturbations. In contrast, symmetric structures like the square graph, featuring degenerate energy levels (particularly ground-state degeneracy), are better suited for precise thermometry. Notably, our four-qubit sensors achieve peak precision in the low-temperature, weak-field regime. Finally, we introduce a spectral sensitivity measure that quantifies energy spectrum deformations under small perturbations, offering a tool to optimize magnetometric performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22398v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a benchmark of eight optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the tVHA, evaluating performance on $H_2$, $H_4$, and $LiH$ (in both full and active spaces) under noiseless and sampling noise conditions. Sampling noise fundamentally alters optimizer behavior, with gradient-based methods performing best in ideal conditions, while population-based algorithms, such as CMA-ES, show greater resilience under noise. Hartree-Fock initialization reduces the number of function evaluations by 27-60% and consistently yields higher final accuracy compared to random starting points. We identify a precision limit set by sampling noise, with diminishing returns beyond approximately 1000 shots.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search on Computation Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a simple generalization of the quantum walk algorithm for search in backtracking trees by Montanaro (ToC 2018) to the case where vertices can have different times of computation. If a vertex $v$ in the tree of depth $D$ is computed in $t_v$ steps from its parent, then we show that detection of a marked vertex requires $\text{O}(\sqrt{TD})$ queries to the steps of the computing procedures, where $T = \sum_v t_v^2$. This framework provides an easy and convenient way to re-obtain a number of other quantum frameworks like variable time search, quantum divide &amp; conquer and bomb query algorithms. The underlying algorithm is simple, explicitly constructed, and has low poly-logarithmic factors in the complexity.
  As a corollary, this gives a quantum algorithm for variable time search with unknown times with optimal query complexity $\text{O}(\sqrt{T \log \min(n,t_{\max})})$, where $T = \sum_i t_i^2$ and $t_{\max} = \max_i t_i$ if $t_i$ is the number of steps required to compute the $i$-th variable. This resolves the open question of the query complexity of variable time search, as the matching lower bound was recently shown by Ambainis, Kokainis and Vihrovs (TQC'23). As another result, we obtain an $\widetilde{\text{O}}(n)$ time algorithm for the geometric task of determining if any three lines among $n$ given intersect at the same point, improving the $\text{O}(n^{1+\text{o}(1)})$ algorithm of Ambainis and Larka (TQC'20).</description>

Abstract: Under the nearing error-corrected era of quantum computing, it is necessary to understand the suitability of certain post-NISQ algorithms for practical problems. One of the most promising, applicable and yet difficult to implement in practical terms is the Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for linear systems of equations. An enormous number of problems can be expressed as linear systems of equations, from Machine Learning to fluid dynamics. However, in most cases, HHL will not be able to provide a practical, reasonable solution to these problems. This paper's goal inquires about whether problems can be labeled using Machine Learning classifiers as suitable or unsuitable for HHL implementation when some numerical information about the problem is known beforehand. This work demonstrates that training on significantly representative data distributions is critical to achieve good classifications of the problems based on the numerical properties of the matrix representing the system of equations. Accurate classification is possible through Multi-Layer Perceptrons, although with careful design of the training data distribution and classifier parameters.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Raman scattering from metastable states of Ba$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum logic gates performed via two-photon stimulated-Raman transitions in ions and atoms are fundamentally limited by spontaneous scattering errors. Recent theoretical treatment of these scattering processes has predicted no lower bound on the error rate of such gates when implemented with far-detuned lasers, while also providing an extension to metastable qubits. To validate this theoretical model, we provide experimental measurements of Raman scattering rates due to near-, and far-detuned lasers for initial states in the metastable D$_{5/2}$ level of $^{137}$Ba$^+$. The measured spontaneous Raman scattering rate is consistent with the theoretical prediction and suggests that metastable-level two-qubit gates with an error rate $\approx10^{-4}$ are possible with laser excitation detuned by tens of terahertz or more.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of robust entanglement generation in engineered XX spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation comparing two entanglement generation protocols in finite XX spin chains with varying spin magnitudes ($s = 1/2, 1, 3/2 $). Protocol 1 (P1) relies on staggered couplings to steer correlations toward the ends of the chain. At the same time, Protocol 2 (P2) adopts a dual-port architecture that uses optimized boundary fields to mediate virtual excitations between terminal spins. Our results show that P2 consistently outperforms P1 in all spin values, generating higher-fidelity entanglement in shorter timescales when evaluated under the same system parameters. Furthermore, P2 exhibits superior robustness under realistic imperfections, including diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, as well as dephasing noise. These advantages stem from its ability to suppress the bulk population and minimize susceptibility to decoherence. Together, the scalability, efficiency, and noise resilience of the dual-port approach position it as a promising framework for entanglement distribution in solid-state quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Assessing Quantum Advantage for Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression is a well-known machine learning technique for which several quantum algorithms have been proposed. We show here that in a wide range of scenarios these algorithms show no exponential speedup. We achieve this by rigorously proving that the condition number of a kernel matrix scales at least linearly with the matrix size under general assumptions on the data and kernel. We additionally prove that the sparsity and Frobenius norm of a kernel matrix scale linearly under similar assumptions. The implications for the quantum algorithms runtime are independent of the complexity of loading classical data on a quantum computer and also apply to dequantised algorithms. We supplement our theoretical analysis with numerical verification for popular kernels in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Closing the Quantum-Classical Scaling Gap in Approximate Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study (Ref. [1]), quantum annealing was reported to exhibit a scaling advantage for approximately solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). However, this claim critically depends on the choice of classical reference algorithm -- Parallel Tempering with Isoenergetic Cluster Moves (PT-ICM). Here, we reassess these findings with different classical paradigm -- Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM) -- that harnesses nonlinear Hamiltonian dynamics. By leveraging chaotic behavior rather than thermal fluctuations, SBM achieves comparable or superior scaling performance, effectively closing the previously reported quantum-classical gap. We show that small problem sizes analyzed in [1] are insufficient for inferring asymptotic scaling, due to sensitivity to runtime and hardware-specific factors. By extending the benchmark to larger instances -- beyond current quantum annealing capabilities -- we establish strong classical scaling behavior. And as a result, we conclude that it is unlikely that current generation of quantum annealers, can demonstrate supremacy in discrete approximate optimization under operationally meaningful conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum engineering of high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum sideband high harmonic generation (QSHHG), high harmonic generation is perturbed by a bright quantum field resulting in harmonic sidebands, with the intent to transfer non-classical properties from the quantum perturbation to the harmonic sidebands. So far, non-classical features have not been found in QSHHG yet. The closed form theory of QSHHG in atoms and solids developed here answers the question under which conditions non-classical features can be realized. QSHHG results in a multi-mode entanglement between harmonic sideband modes and perturbative quantum mode. A projective measurement on either creates a variety of non-classical states commonly used in quantum information science. This opens a pathway towards quantum engineering high harmonic generation as a short wavelength source for quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Minimal Quantum Reservoirs with Hamiltonian Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal architecture for quantum reservoir computing based on Hamiltonian encoding, in which input data is injected via modulation of system parameters rather than state preparation. This approach circumvents many of the experimental overheads typically associated with quantum machine learning, enabling computation without feedback, memory, or state tomography. We demonstrate that such a minimal quantum reservoir, despite lacking intrinsic memory, can perform nonlinear regression and prediction tasks when augmented with post-processing delay embeddings. Our results provide a conceptually and practically streamlined framework for quantum information processing, offering a clear baseline for future implementations on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Sweet and Sour Regions in Bichromatically Driven Floquet Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern superconducting and semiconducting quantum hardware use external charge and microwave flux drives to both tune and operate devices. However, each external drive is susceptible to low-frequency (e.g., $1/f$) noise that can drastically reduce the decoherence lifetime of the device unless the drive is placed at specific operating points that minimize the sensitivity to fluctuations. We show that operating a qubit in a driven frame using two periodic drives of distinct commensurate frequencies can have advantages over both monochromatically driven frames and static frames with constant offset drives. Employing Floquet theory, we analyze the spectral and lifetime characteristics of a two-level system under weak and strong bichromatic drives, identifying drive-parameter regions with high coherence (sweet spots) and highlighting regions where coherence is limited by additional sensitivity to noise at the drive frequencies (sour spots). We present analytical expressions for quasienergy gaps and dephasing rates, demonstrating that bichromatic driving can alleviate the trade-off between DC and AC noise robustness observed in monochromatic drives. This approach reveals continuous manifolds of doubly dynamical sweet spots, along which drive parameters can be varied without compromising coherence. Our results motivate further study of bichromatic Floquet engineering as a powerful strategy for maintaining tunability in high-coherence quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Disambiguating Pauli noise in quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To successfully perform quantum computations, it is often necessary to first accurately characterize the noise in the underlying hardware. However, it is well known that fundamental limitations prevent the unique identification of the noise. This raises the question of whether these limitations impact the ability to predict noisy dynamics and mitigate errors. Here, we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that when learnable parameters are self-consistently characterized, the unlearnable (gauge) degrees of freedom do not impact predictions of noisy dynamics or error mitigation. We use the recently introduced framework of gate set Pauli noise learning to efficiently and self-consistently characterize and mitigate noise of a complete gate set, including state preparation, measurements, single-qubit gates and multi-qubit entangling Clifford gates. We validate our approach through experiments with up to 92 qubits and show that while the gauge choice does not affect error-mitigated observable values, optimizing it reduces sampling overhead. Our findings address an outstanding issue involving the ambiguities in characterizing and mitigating quantum noise.</description>

      <title>A multimode cavity QED Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Visualization enhances Problem Solving in Multi-Qubit Systems: An Eye-Tracking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Information Science (QIS) is a vast, diverse, and abstract field. In consequence, learners face many challenges. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education research has found that visualizations are valuable to aid learners in complex matters. The conditions under which visualizations pose benefits are largely unexplored in QIS education. In this eye-tracking study, we examine the conditions under which the visualization of multi-qubit systems in addition to the mathematical symbolic Dirac Notation (DN) is associated with a benefit for solving problems on the ubiquitously used Hadamard gate operation in terms of performance, Extraneous Cognitive Load (ECL) and Intrinsic Cognitive Load (ICL). We find that visualization increases performance and reduces cognitive load for participants with little experience in quantum physics. In addition, representational competence is able to predict reductions in ECL with visualization, but not performance or ICL. Analysis of the eye-tracking results indicates that problem solvers with more transitions between DN and visualization benefit less from it. We discuss the generalizability of the results and practical implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important challenge for quantum theories of cognition and decision concerns the incorporation of memory for recently made judgments and their effects on later judgments. First, we review a general approach to measurement based on system plus environment representations of states and measurement instruments. These more general measurement models provide ways to incorporate effects of recent judgments on later judgments. Then we compare three different measurement models that are based on these more general measurement operations to a puzzling collection of question order effect findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional multi-orbital Kondo lattice model and show that by tuning the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons it is possible to stabilize Kondo insulators with non-trivial spin physics. In particular, depending on the size of the exchange coupling between the local moments, we find kinetic-energy-driven transitions between a featureless Kondo insulator and a valence-bond solid or a gapless spin liquid. We also provide evidence for an unconventional continuous phase transition between two featureless Kondo insulators distinguished by their quantum numbers under reflection symmetry.</description>

      <title>Optical Interference Effect in Strong-field Electronic Coherence Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.</description>

      <title>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Many-Body Scars in 2D Quantum Gauge Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model.

      <title>Universal principles for sudden-quench quantum Otto engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a simple sudden quench approximation for the unitary work strokes of a quantum Otto engine in order to provide a general analysis of its performance, applicable to arbitrary quantum models with two-body interactions. This work extends recent results for an interaction-driven Otto cycle to generic many-body interacting quantum models, providing universal bounds on their operation efficiency. From this, we demonstrate that the net work of such an engine cycle is determined entirely by interparticle correlations. Applications are demonstrated for a handful of paradigmatic many-body quantum models, including a novel engine -- with a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact two-body interactions as its working medium -- in which we leverage control over spin polarization to greatly enhance its performance compared to the unpolarized case. We then extend the analysis of interaction-driven quantum Otto engine cycles to systems where control is exerted over the strength of arbitrary quantum operators that might be present in the system Hamiltonian (such as one-body, or three-body, etc.), finding that the general principles derived for the sudden quench with two-body interactions apply universally. As an example, this is demonstrated for a conventional volumetric Otto cycle, where beneficial net work is generated by leveraging the control over the frequency of an external trap, which is a one-body operator. However, we emphasize that the results derived here apply universally to all Otto engine cycles operating under a sudden quench protocol.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index $n$, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of $n$ according to Max Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Hermann Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of photons and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole corresponds to the Abraham momentum. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum determines the direction of propagation and the precession of the photon spin, which is described by an SO(3) rotation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate thermal spin pumping in gadolinium iron garnet, focusing on dynamics of antiferromagnetic magnon and its impact on spin and heat transport. Antiferromagnet has right-handed and left-handed magnon modes. Using a two-magnetic-lattice model, we derive temperature-dependent spin-wave spectra and thermal spin pumping constants, revealing distinct transport regimes governed by competing contribution of magnon modes. We show that competition of both modes induces a compensation temperature in thermally generated spin current. This theoretical framework deepens the understanding of spin-caloritronic effects in ferrimagnets, offering new perspectives for spintronic device optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible Raman lattice system for alakaline-earth like atoms to investigate localization behaviors in a quasi-periodic lattice with controllable non-Hermiticity. We demonstrate that critical phases and mobility edges can arise by adjusting spin-dependence of the incommensurate potentials in the Hermitian regime. With non-Hermiticity introduced by spin-selective atom loss, we find the localization behaviour in this system can be suppressed by dissipation. Our work provides insights into interplay between quasi-periodicity and non-Hermitian physics, offering a new perspective on localization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Diverse Topological States in Ge Doped MnBi2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an ideal platform for studying interplays between symmetry, topology and magnetism, the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) MnBi2Te4 has attracted extensive attentions. However, its strong n-type intrinsic defects hinder the realizations of exotic phenomena. Stimulated by recent discoveries that Ge doping can efficiently tune the position of Fermi level, here we systematically investigate the band evolution and topological phase diagram with doping concentration from MTI MnBi2Te4 to strong topological insulator GeBi2Te4. Different from magnetically doped Bi2Se3, the topology here is determined by competition of two band inversions arising from band folding of two time-reversal invariant momenta between antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic unit cells. By employing a band momentum mapping method, besides the known MTI phase, remarkably, we find two classes of magnetic Dirac semimetal phases at antiferromagnetic state, two classes of Weyl semimetal phases at ferromagnetic state, and an intermediate trivial state at different doping regions. Interestingly, the trivial state can be tuned into a Weyl phase with two coexisting band inversions and extraordinarily long Fermi arcs by a small strain. Our work reveals diverse topological states with intrinsic quantum phenomena can be achieved with great potential for designing future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22433v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.</description>

      <title>TabularQGAN: A Quantum Generative Model for Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum generative model for synthesizing tabular data. Synthetic data is valuable in scenarios where real-world data is scarce or private, it can be used to augment or replace existing datasets. Real-world enterprise data is predominantly tabular and heterogeneous, often comprising a mixture of categorical and numerical features, making it highly relevant across various industries such as healthcare, finance, and software. We propose a quantum generative adversarial network architecture with flexible data encoding and a novel quantum circuit ansatz to effectively model tabular data. The proposed approach is tested on the MIMIC III healthcare and Adult Census datasets, with extensive benchmarking against leading classical models, CTGAN, and CopulaGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our quantum model outperforms classical models by an average of 8.5% with respect to an overall similarity score from SDMetrics, while using only 0.072% of the parameters of the classical models. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of the models using two custom-designed metrics that demonstrate the ability of the proposed quantum model to generate useful and novel samples. To our knowledge, this is one of the first demonstrations of a successful quantum generative model for handling tabular data, indicating that this task could be well-suited to quantum computers.</description>

      <title>How to avoid (apparent) signaling in Bell tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.05739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell tests have become a powerful tool for quantifying security, randomness, entanglement, and many other properties, as well as for investigating fundamental physical limits. In all these cases, the specific experimental value of the Bell parameter is important as it leads to a quantitative conclusion. However, experimental implementations can also produce experimental data with (apparent) signaling. This signaling can be attributed to systematic errors occurring due to weaknesses in the experimental designs. Here we point out the importance, for quantitative applications, to identify and address this problem. We present a set of experiments with polarization-entangled photons in which we identify common sources of systematic errors and demonstrate approaches to avoid them. In addition, we establish the highest experimental value for the Bell-CHSH parameter obtained after applying strategies to minimize signaling that we are aware of: $S = 2.812 \pm 0.003$ and negligible systematic errors. The experiments did not randomize the settings and did not close the locality loophole.</description>

Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have demonstrated considerable success as variational quantum states; however, their representational power remains incompletely understood. In this work, we present an analytical proof that RBMs can exactly and efficiently represent stabilizer code states (a class of highly entangled quantum states that are central to quantum error correction). Given a set of stabilizer generators, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine both the RBM architecture and the exact values of its parameters. Our findings provide new insights into the expressive power of RBMs, highlighting their capability to encode highly entangled states, and may serve as a useful tool for the classical simulation of quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

Abstract: Interactions of electron spins with rotational degrees of freedom during collisions or with external fields are fundamental processes that limit the coherence time of spin gases. We experimentally study the decoherence of hot cesium spins dominated by spin rotation-interaction during binary collisions with N$_2$ molecules or by absorption of near-resonant light. We report an order of magnitude suppression of the spin decoherence rate by either of those processes at low magnetic fields. This work extends the use of magnetic fields as a control knob, not only to suppress decoherence from random spin-conserving processes in the Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free (SERF) regime but also to suppress processes that relax electron spins rather than conserve them.</description>

Abstract: SERF magnetometers based on dense ensembles of alkali-metal spins are precision quantum sensors that hold the record of measured and projected sensitivity to magnetic fields, in the $\mu\textrm{G}-\textrm{mG}$ range. At geomagnetic fields however, these sensors quickly lose their magnetic sensitivity due to spin decoherence by random spin-exchange collisions. Here we discover that atoms with nuclear spin $I=1/2$ can operate in the Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free (SERF) regime even at high magnetic field. We counter-intuitively show that frequent collisions between a dense and optically-inaccessible $(I=1/2)$ gas with another optically-accessible spin gas ($I&gt;1/2$) improve the fundamental magnetic sensitivity of the latter. We analyze the performance of a dual-specie potassium and atomic hydrogen magnetometer, and project a fundamental sensitivity of about $10\,\mathrm{aT}\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{Hz}}$ at geomagnetic fields for feasible experimental conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom unitaries are neither real nor sparse nor noise-robust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) possess the dual nature of being efficiently constructible while appearing completely random to any efficient quantum algorithm. In this study, we establish fundamental bounds on pseudorandomness. We show that PRSs and PRUs exist only when the probability that an error occurs is negligible, ruling out their generation on noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Further, we show that PRUs need imaginarity while PRS do not have this restriction. This implies that quantum randomness requires in general a complex-valued formalism of quantum mechanics, while for random quantum states real numbers suffice. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the coherence of PRSs and PRUs, ruling out the existence of sparse PRUs and PRSs. We also show that the notions of PRS, PRUs and pseudorandom scramblers (PRSSs) are distinct in terms of resource requirements. We introduce the concept of pseudoresources, where states which contain a low amount of a given resource masquerade as high-resource states. We define pseudocoherence, pseudopurity and pseudoimaginarity, and identify three distinct types of pseudoresources in terms of their masquerading capabilities. Our work also establishes rigorous bounds on the efficiency of property testing, demonstrating the exponential complexity in distinguishing real quantum states from imaginary ones, in contrast to the efficient measurability of unitary imaginarity. Further, we show an exponential advantage in imaginarity testing when having access to the complex conjugate of the state. Lastly, we show that the transformation from a complex to a real model of quantum computation is inefficient, in contrast to the reverse process, which is efficient. Our results establish fundamental limits on property testing and provide valuable insights into quantum pseudorandomness.</description>

Existing classical algorithms for tackling this problem often assume that the ground state has a succinct classical description, i.e. a poly-size classical circuit for computing the amplitude. Notable examples of succinct states encompass matrix product states, contractible projected entangled pair states, and states that can be represented by classical neural networks.
  We study the complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem with succinct ground state. We prove this problem is MA-Complete. The Hamiltonian we consider is general and might not be stoquastic. The MA verification protocol is based on the fixed node quantum Monte Carlo method, particularly the variant of the continuous-time Markov chain introduced by Bravyi et.al. [BCGL22].
  Based on our work, we also introduce a notion of strong guided states, and conjecture that the local Hamiltonian problem with strong guided state is MA-Complete, which will be in contrast with the QCMA-Complete result of the local Hamiltonian problem with standard guided states [WFC23,GLG22].</description>

      <title>On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>

      <title>Dividing quantum circuits for time evolution of stochastic processes by orthogonal series density estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo integration (QMCI) is a quantum algorithm to estimate expectations of random variables, with applications in various industrial fields such as financial derivative pricing. When QMCI is applied to expectations concerning a stochastic process $X(t)$, e.g., an underlying asset price in derivative pricing, the quantum circuit $U_{X(t)}$ to generate the quantum state encoding the probability density of $X(t)$ can have a large depth. With time discretized into $N$ points, using state preparation oracles for the transition probabilities of $X(t)$, the state preparation for $X(t)$ results in a depth of $O(N)$, which may be problematic for large $N$. Moreover, if we estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ at $N$ time points, the total query complexity scales on $N$ as $O(N^2)$, which is worse than the $O(N)$ complexity in the classical Monte Carlo method. In this paper, to improve this, we propose a method to divide $U_{X(t)}$ based on orthogonal series density estimation. This approach involves approximating the densities of $X(t)$ at $N$ time points with orthogonal series, where the coefficients are estimated as expectations of the orthogonal functions by QMCI. By using these approximated densities, we can estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ by QMCI without requiring deep circuits. Our error and complexity analysis shows that to obtain the approximated densities at $N$ time points, our method achieves the circuit depth and total query complexity scaling as $O(\sqrt{N})$ and $O(N^{3/2})$, respectively.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Multi-Qubit Clifford+T Synthesis by Unitary Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00433v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resource-efficient and high-precision approximate synthesis of quantum circuits expressed in the Clifford+T gate set is vital for Fault-Tolerant quantum computing. Efficient optimal methods are known for single-qubit $R_Z$ unitaries, otherwise the problem is generally intractable. Search-based methods, like simulated annealing, empirically generate low resource cost approximate implementations of general multi-qubit unitaries so long as low precision (Hilbert-Schmidt distances of $\epsilon \geq 10^{-2}$) can be tolerated. These algorithms build up circuits that directly invert target unitaries. We instead leverage search-based methods to first approximately diagonalize a unitary, then perform the inversion analytically. This lets difficult continuous rotations be bypassed and handled in a post-processing step. Our approach improves both the implementation precision and run time of synthesis algorithms by orders of magnitude when evaluated on unitaries from real quantum algorithms. On benchmarks previously synthesizable only with analytical techniques like the Quantum Shannon Decomposition, diagonalization uses an average of 95% fewer non-Clifford gates.</description>

Abstract: We show that the average of the maximum teleportation fidelities between all pairs of nodes in a large quantum repeater network is a measure of the resourcefulness of the network as a whole. We use simple Werner state-based models to characterise some fundamental (loopless) topologies (star, chain, and some trees) with respect to this measure in three (semi)realistic scenarios. Most of our results are analytic and are applicable for arbitrary network sizes. We identify the parameter ranges where these networks can achieve quantum advantages and show the large-N behaviours.</description>

      <title>More buck-per-shot: Why learning trumps mitigation in noisy quantum sensing</title>

Abstract: Quantum sensing is one of the most promising applications for quantum technologies. However, reaching the ultimate sensitivities enabled by the laws of quantum mechanics can be a challenging task in realistic scenarios where noise is present. While several strategies have been proposed to deal with the detrimental effects of noise, these come at the cost of an extra shot budget. Given that shots are a precious resource for sensing -- as infinite measurements could lead to infinite precision -- care must be taken to truly guarantee that any shot not being used for sensing is actually leading to some metrological improvement. In this work, we study whether investing shots in error-mitigation, inference techniques, or combinations thereof, can improve the sensitivity of a noisy quantum sensor on a (shot) budget. We present a detailed bias-variance error analysis for various sensing protocols. Our results show that the costs of zero-noise extrapolation techniques outweigh their benefits. We also find that pre-characterizing a quantum sensor via inference techniques leads to the best performance, under the assumption that the sensor is sufficiently stable.</description>

      <title>Gibbs state preparation for commuting Hamiltonian: Mapping to classical Gibbs sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gibbs state preparation, or Gibbs sampling, is a key computational technique extensively used in physics, statistics, and other scientific fields. Recent efforts for designing fast mixing Gibbs samplers for quantum Hamiltonians have largely focused on commuting local Hamiltonians (CLHs), a non-trivial subclass of Hamiltonians which include highly entangled systems such as the Toric code and quantum double model. Most previous Gibbs samplers relied on simulating the Davies generator, which is a Lindbladian associated with the thermalization process in nature.
  Instead of using the Davies generator, we design a different Gibbs sampler for various CLHs by giving a reduction to classical Hamiltonians, in the sense that one can efficiently prepare the Gibbs state for some CLH $H$ on a quantum computer as long as one can efficiently do classical Gibbs sampling for the corresponding classical Hamiltonian $H^{(c)}$. We demonstrate that our Gibbs sampler is able to replicate state-of-the-art results as well as prepare the Gibbs state in regimes which were previously unknown, such as the low temperature region, as long as there exists fast mixing Gibbs samplers for the corresponding classical Hamiltonians. Our reductions are as follows.
  - If $H$ is a 2-local qudit CLH, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are no classical qubits, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian on a planar graph. As an example, our algorithm can prepare the Gibbs state for the (defected) Toric code at any non-zero temperature in $\mathcal O(n^2)$ time.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are classical qubits, assuming that quantum terms are uniformly correctable, then $H^{(c)}$ is a constant-local classical Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Quantum implementation of non-unitary operations with biorthogonal representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the contemporary advances in quantum implementation of non-unitary operations, we propose a new dilation method based on the biorthogonal representation of the non-unitary operator, mapping it to an isomorphic unitary matrix in the orthonormal computational basis. The proposed method excels in implementing non-unitary operators whose eigenvalues have absolute values exceeding one, when compared to other dilation and decomposition techniques. Unlike the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method, which becomes less efficient as the number of unitary summands grows, the proposed technique is optimal for small-dimensional non-unitary operators regardless of the number of unitary summands. Thus, it can complement the LCU method for implementing general non-unitary operators arising in positive only open quantum systems and pseudo-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two models of space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems, ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. The ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ model, a space-bounded variant of quantum interactive proofs (${\sf QIP}$) introduced by Watrous (CC 2003) and Kitaev and Watrous (STOC 2000), restricts verifier actions to unitary circuits. In contrast, ${\sf QIPL}$ allows logarithmically many pinching intermediate measurements per verifier action, making it the weakest model that encompasses the classical model of Condon and Ladner (JCSS 1995).
  We characterize the computational power of ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. When the message number $m$ is polynomially bounded, ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L} \subsetneq {\sf QIPL}$ unless ${\sf P} = {\sf NP}$:
  - ${\sf QIPL}^{\rm HC}$, a subclass of ${\sf QIPL}$ defined by a high-concentration condition on yes instances, exactly characterizes ${\sf NP}$.
  - ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ is contained in ${\sf P}$ and contains ${\sf SAC}^1 \cup {\sf BQL}$, where ${\sf SAC}^1$ denotes problems solvable by classical logarithmic-depth, semi-unbounded fan-in circuits.
  However, this distinction vanishes when $m$ is constant. Our results further indicate that (pinching) intermediate measurements uniquely impact space-bounded quantum interactive proofs, unlike in space-bounded quantum computation, where ${\sf BQL}={\sf BQ_{\rm U}L}$.
  We also introduce space-bounded unitary quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L}$), a specific form of ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ proof systems with statistical zero-knowledge against any verifier. This class is a space-bounded variant of quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK}$) defined by Watrous (SICOMP 2009). We prove that ${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L} = {\sf BQL}$, implying that the statistical zero-knowledge property negates the computational advantage typically gained from the interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploring the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes and maximum likelihood decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel is an important problem in the field of quantum communication theory. In this work, we consider the Gaussian random displacement channel $N_{\sigma}$, a type of bosonic Gaussian channels relevant in various bosonic quantum information processing systems. In particular, we attempt to make progress on the problem of determining the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel by analyzing the error-correction performance of several families of multi-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In doing so we analyze the surface-square GKP codes using an efficient and exact maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) up to a large code distance of $d=39$. We find that the error threshold of the surface-square GKP code is remarkably close to $\sigma=1/\sqrt{e}\simeq 0.6065$ at which the best-known lower bound of the quantum capacity of $N_{\sigma}$ vanishes. We also analyze the performance of color-hexagonal GKP codes up to a code distance of $d=13$ using a tensor-network decoder serving as an approximate MLD. By focusing on multi-mode GKP codes that encode just one logical qubit over multiple bosonic modes, we show that GKP codes can achieve non-zero quantum state transmission rates for a Gaussian random displacement channel $N_{\sigma}$ at larger values of $\sigma$ than previously demonstrated. Thus our work reduces the gap between the quantum communication theoretic bounds and the performance of explicit bosonic quantum error-correcting codes in regards to the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random displacement channel.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the pump coupling for a three-wave mixing Josephson parametric amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson element-based parametric amplifiers (JPAs) typically require rf pump power that is several orders of magnitude stronger than the maximum signal power they can handle. The low power efficiency and strong pump leakage towards signal circuitry could be critical concerns in application. In this work, we discuss how to optimize the pump coupling scheme for a three-wave mixing JPA by employing microwave filtering techniques, with the goal of maximizing the pump power efficiency and minimize pump leakage without sacrificing other properties of interest. We implement the corresponding filter design in a SNAIL-based JPA and demonstrate more than three orders of magnitude improvement in both power efficiency and pump leakage suppression compared to a similar device with regular capacitive coupling, while maintaining state-of-the-art dynamic range and near-quantum-limited noise performance. Furthermore, we show experimentally that the filter-coupled JPA is more robust against noise input from the pump port, exhibiting no significant change in added noise performance with up to 4 K of effective noise temperature at the pump port.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of binary image classification. We use two distinct methodologies: using randomized NNs on dimensionality-reduced data, and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate these approaches on three data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial hypercube dataset, MNIST handwritten digits and real-world industrial images. We analyze correlations between classification accuracy and quantum model hyperparameters, including the number of trainable parameters, feature encoding methods, circuit layers, entangling gate type and structure, gate entangling power, and measurement operators. For random quantum NNs, we compare their performance against literature models. Classical and quantum/hybrid models achieved statistically equivalent classification accuracies across most datasets, with no approach demonstrating consistent superiority. We observe that quantum models show lower variance with respect to initial training parameters, suggesting better training stability. Among the hyperparameters analyzed, only the number of trainable parameters showed a positive correlation with the model performance. Around 94% of the best-performing quantum NNs had entangling gates, although for hybrid CNNs, models without entanglement performed equally well but took longer to converge. Cross-dataset performance analysis revealed limited transferability of quantum models between different classification tasks. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum machine learning for practical image classification tasks, highlighting both current limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across varied applications.</description>

Abstract: We report the achievement of single-qubit gates with sub-part-per-million error rates, in a trapped-ion $^{43}$Ca$^{+}$ hyperfine clock qubit. We explore the speed/fidelity trade-off for gate times $4.4\leq t_{g}\leq35~\mu$s, and benchmark a minimum error per Clifford gate of $1.5(4) \times 10^{-7}$. Calibration errors are suppressed to $&lt; 10^{-8}$, leaving qubit decoherence ($T_{2}\approx 70$ s), leakage, and measurement as the dominant error contributions. The ion is held above a microfabricated surface-electrode trap which incorporates a chip-integrated microwave resonator for electronic qubit control; the trap is operated at room temperature without magnetic shielding.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of Quantum States can be Transitive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a striking manifestation of quantum entanglement, nonlocality has long played a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of the quantum world. When considering a Bell test involving three parties, we may even find a remarkable situation where the nonlocality in two bipartite subsystems {\em forces} the remaining bipartite subsystem to exhibit nonlocality. This intriguing effect, dubbed nonlocality transitivity, was first identified in the non-quantum non-signaling world in 2011. However, whether such transitivity could manifest within quantum theory has remained unresolved -- until now. Here, we provide the first affirmative answer to this open problem at the level of quantum states, thereby showing that there exists a quantum-realizable notion of nonlocality transitivity. Specifically, by leveraging the possibility of Bell-inequality violation by tensoring, we analytically construct a pair of nonlocal bipartite states such that simultaneously realizing them in a tripartite system induces nonlocality in the remaining bipartite subsystem. En route to showing this, we also prove that multiple copies of the $W$-state marginals uniquely determine the global compatible state, thus establishing another instance when the parts determine the whole. Surprisingly, the nonlocality transitivity of quantum states also occurs among the reduced states of Haar-random three-qutrit pure states. We further show that the transitivity of quantum steering can already be demonstrated with the marginals of a three-qubit $W$ state, showing again another noteworthy difference between the two forms of quantum correlations. Finally, we present a simple method to construct quantum states and correlations that are nonlocal in all their non-unipartite marginals, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum framework for addressing reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, grounded in the quantum principles and leveraging a fully quantum model of the classical Markov decision process (MDP). By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Quantum: A Quantum-HPC Middleware for Resource, Workload and Task Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum hardware advances, integrating quantum processing units (QPUs) into HPC environments and managing diverse infrastructure and software stacks becomes increasingly essential. Pilot-Quantum addresses these challenges as a middleware designed to provide unified application-level management of resources and workloads across hybrid quantum-classical environments. It is built on a rigorous analysis of existing quantum middleware systems and application execution patterns. It implements the Pilot Abstraction conceptual model, originally developed for HPC, to manage resources, workloads, and tasks. It is designed for quantum applications that rely on task parallelism, including (i) hybrid algorithms, such as variational approaches, and (ii) circuit cutting systems, used to partition and execute large quantum circuits. Pilot-Quantum facilitates seamless integration of QPUs, classical CPUs, and GPUs, while supporting high-level programming frameworks like Qiskit and Pennylane. This enables users to efficiently design and execute hybrid workflows across diverse computing resources. The capabilities of Pilot-Quantum are demonstrated through mini-apps -- simplified yet representative kernels focusing on critical performance bottlenecks. We demonstrate the capabilities of Pilot-Quantum through multiple mini-apps, including different circuit executions (e.g., using IBM\'s Eagle QPU and simulators), circuit cutting, and quantum machine learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Control under Physical Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum control is concerned with the realisation of desired dynamics in quantum systems, serving as a linchpin for advancing quantum technologies and fundamental research. Analytic approaches and standard optimisation algorithms do not yield satisfactory solutions for more complex quantum systems, and especially not for real world quantum systems which are open and noisy. We devise a physics-constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that restricts the space of possible solutions. We incorporate priors about the desired time scales of the quantum state dynamics - as well as realistic control signal limitations - as constraints to the RL algorithm. These constraints improve solution quality and enhance computational scaleability. We evaluate our method on three broadly relevant quantum systems and incorporate real-world complications, arising from dissipation and control signal perturbations. We achieve both higher fidelities - which exceed 0.999 across all systems - and better robustness to time-dependent perturbations and experimental imperfections than previous methods. Lastly, we demonstrate that incorporating multi-step feedback can yield solutions robust even to strong perturbations. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/jan-o-e/RL4qcWpc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits, caused by loss mechanisms like material imperfections and two-level system (TLS) defects, remains a major obstacle to improving the performance of quantum devices. In this work, we present atomic-level characterization of cross-sections of a Josephson junction and a spiral resonator to assess the quality of critical interfaces. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we identify structural imperfections associated with oxide layer formation and carbon-based contamination, and correlate these imperfections to the patterning and etching steps in the fabrication process and environmental exposure. These results suggest that TLS imperfections at critical interfaces significantly contribute to limiting device performance, emphasizing the need for an improved fabrication process.</description>

      <title>Quantum Non-Local Nonstabilizerness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06393v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum nonstabilizerness are fundamental resources that characterize distinct aspects of a quantum state: entanglement reflects non-local correlations, while nonstabilizerness quantifies the deviation from stabilizer states. A quantum state becomes a valuable resource for applications like universal quantum computation only when both quantities are present. Here, we propose that quantum non-local nonstabilizerness (NN) serves as an effective measure of this combined resource, incorporating both entanglement and nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that NN can be precisely computed for two-qubit pure states, where it is directly related to the entanglement spectrum. We then extend the definition of NN to mixed states and explore its presence in many-body quantum systems, revealing that the two-point NN decays according to a power law in critical states. Furthermore, we explore measurement-induced NN and uncover an intriguing phenomenon termed "nonstabilizerness swapping", analogous to entanglement swapping, wherein post-measurement NN decays more slowly than any pre-measurement correlations. Our results thus represent a pivotal step towards accurately quantifying the "quantumness" of a state and reveal the potential for manipulating this resource through measurements.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the performance of quantum processing units at large width and depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers have now surpassed classical simulation limits, yet noise continues to limit their practical utility. As the field shifts from proof-of-principle demonstrations to early deployments, there is no standard method for meaningfully and scalably comparing heterogeneous quantum hardware. Existing benchmarks typically focus on gate-level fidelity or constant-depth circuits, offering limited insight into algorithmic performance at depth. Here we introduce a benchmarking protocol based on the linear ramp quantum approximate optimization algorithm (LR-QAOA), a fixed-parameter, deterministic variant of QAOA. LR-QAOA quantifies a QPU's ability to preserve a coherent signal as circuit depth increases, identifying when performance becomes statistically indistinguishable from random sampling. We apply this protocol to 24 quantum processors from six vendors, testing problems with up to 156 qubits and 10,000 layers across 1D-chains, native layouts, and fully connected topologies. This constitutes the most extensive cross-platform quantum benchmarking effort to date, with circuits reaching a million two-qubit gates. LR-QAOA offers a scalable, unified benchmark across platforms and architectures, making it a tool for tracking performance in quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the properties of heralded number states including up to three photons that are generated from single-mode twin beams. We investigate the effects of different parameters involved in the state preparation by using the fidelity, normalized second-order factorial moment of photon number for the heralded state $(g^{(2)}_h)$, and photon-number parity as figures of merit. Especially, the photon-number parity offers a practical and robust tool for inferring the target state quality by capturing the contamination of all undesired photon-number contributions. We focus on expressing our results in terms of experimentally easily accessible parameters such as the coincidences-to-accidentals ratio and the detection efficiencies. Our results identify the optimal parameter regions for generating high quality photon-number states by heralding and provide useful insights for advancing their use in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays an irreplaceable role in various remote quantum information processing tasks. Here we present protocols for generating deterministic and heralded $N$-qubit entangled states across multiple network nodes. By utilizing a pre-shared maximally entangled state and single-qubit operations within an indefinite causal order framework, the multi-qubit entangled state between distant parties can be generated deterministically. The complex entangled state measurements and multiple pre-shared entangled states, are essential in conventional entanglement swapping technique, but are not required in our approach. This greatly reduces the complexity of the quantum circuit and makes it more experimentally feasible. Furthermore, we develop optical architectures to implement these protocols by encoding qubits in polarization degree of freedom. The results indicate that our protocols significantly improve the efficiency of long-distance entanglement generation and provide a practical framework for establishing large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Entropic Diagram Characterization of Quantum Coherence: Degenerate Distillation and the Maximum Eigenvalue Uncertainty Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09110v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for quantifying quantum coherence in finite-dimensional systems by applying the Schur-Horn majorization theorem to relate eigenvalue distributions and diagonal entries of density matrices. Building on this foundation, we introduce a versatile suite of coherence measures, including the relative cross-entropy of coherence and its partial variants, that satisfy all resource theoretic axioms under incoherent operations. This unifying approach clarifies the geometric boundaries of physically realizable states in von Neumann-Tsallis entropy space and uncovers the phenomenon of degenerate coherence distillation where symmetry in the eigenvalue spectrum enables enhanced coherence extraction in higher-dimensional systems. In addition, we strengthen the entropy-based uncertainty relation by refining the Maassen-Uffink bound to account for the largest eigenvalues across distinct measurement bases. This refinement forges a deeper connection between entropy and uncertainty, which yields operationally meaningful constraints for quantum information tasks. Altogether, our findings illustrate the power of majorization in resource-theoretic analyses of quantum coherence, which offer valuable tools for both fundamental research and real-world applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate flux-induced losses and extract a sensitivity to trapped flux of approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The sensitivity decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the flux-induced frequency shift exhibits a minimum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled assuming the thermal activation of pinning centers within the Gittleman-Rosenblum framework. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: The role of polarization in the topology of quantum emitter chains is investigated theoretically, whereby "polarization" refers to the transition dipole moments of the emitters. We show that, if the chain is zigzag-shaped, different topological phases can be realized by adjusting the polarization direction. It turns out that long-range dipole-dipole couplings weaken the bulk-boundary correspondence, but on the other hand give rise to higher-order topological phases with four observable edge modes. We also demonstrate how the polarization orientation can be used to define an additional dimension and simulate a synthetic Chern insulator. Our findings open up a way to actively switch between various topological phases within a single arrangement of quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full design of relevant systems for quantum applications, ranging from quantum simulation to sensing, is presented using a combination of atomistic methods. A prototypical system features a two-dimensional ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. We study the case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling with $S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto \hkl(001) and \hkl(111) 3C-SiC surfaces. We simulate the system fabrication processes with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). We identify a rich scenario of metastable spin-waves in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has become a widely used platform for quantum sensing. The four NV axes in mono-crystalline diamond specifically allow for vector magnetometry, with magnetic-field sensitivities reaching down to $\mathrm{fT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The current literature primarily focuses on improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the experimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured spin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact, analytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies from a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating the magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally, the accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote using the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured resonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement between several particles is essential for applications like quantum metrology or quantum cryptography, but it is also central for foundational phenomena like quantum non-locality. This leads to the problem of quantifying the amount of entanglement in a quantum state. We present a review on the geometric measure of entanglement, being a quantifier based on the distance of a state to the nearest separable state. We explain basic properties, existing methods to compute it, its operational interpretations, as well as scaling and complexity issues. We point out intimate relations to fundamental problems in mathematics concerning eigenvalues and norms of tensors. Consequently, the geometric measure of entanglement provides a playground where physical intuition and mathematical rigor benefit from each other.</description>

The F-symbol and R-symbol matrices were computed through the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2), enabling precise determination of elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) for SU(2)k anyon systems. Quantum gates were subsequently derived from these EBMs through systematic implementations. One-qubit gates were synthesized using a genetic algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), while two-qubit gates were constructed through brute-force search or GA optimization to approximate local equivalence classes of the CNOT gate. Implementing this framework for SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 models successfully generated the canonical universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate}. Comparative benchmarking against the Fibonacci anyon model demonstrate that SU(2)5,6,7 implementations achieve comparable or superior fidelity in gate construction. These numerical results provide conclusive verification of the universal quantum computation capabilities inherent in SU(2)k anyon models. Furthermore, we get exact implementations of the local equivalence class [SWAP] using nine EBMs in each SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 configuration.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Dimensional Factorization Limits in Discrete Diffusion Models through Quantum Joint Distribution Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational speedup and retrocausality</title>

Abstract: Involving only the measurements of commuting observables (the setting and the corresponding solution of the problem), quantum algorithms should be subject to classical logic. Under this assumption, their customary quantum description can be flunked by a classical logic description. This creates a new perspective under which to see them. The classical logic description of an optimal quantum algorithm shows that the sheer existence of its quantum speedup logically implies the mutually exclusive or of causal loops. In each of them, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance, before beginning her problem-solving action, one of the possible halves of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will produce and measure in the future. Then, she can use this knowledge in the best logical way to produce the solution with exactly the number of computation steps of the optimal quantum algorithm. Since the quantum and classical logic descriptions of the quantum algorithm must go along, this tells us that their customary quantum description, which says nothing of the sort, must be incomplete. It is indeed completed by time-symmetrizing it. This leaves the unitary part of the customary quantum description mathematically unaltered but changes the description of the behavior of causality along it. Its single causal process is replaced by the quantum superposition of the causal loops whose mutually exclusive or is logically implied by the sheer existence of the quantum speedup.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations without quantum corrections: A coherent-incoherent correspondence approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system undergoing coherent evolution and its corresponding incoherent system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within it, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This framework provides a general method for deriving trade-offs in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Partite-wise Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that $\rho^{AB}$ as a bipartite reduced state of the 3-qubit GHZ state is separable, but part $A$ and part $B$ are indeed entangled with each other without tracing out part $C$. Namely, whether a state containing entanglement is always dependent on the global system it lives in. We explore here such entanglement in any $n$-partite system with arbitrary dimensions, $n\geqslant3$, and call it partite-wise entanglement (PWE) which contains pairwise entanglement (PE) proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 032420(2024)] as a special case. In particular, we investigate the partite-wise entanglement extensibility, and from which we find that the reduced state of a genuine entangled state could be any mixed state without pure reduced states. We then propose three classes of the partite-wise entanglement measures which are based on the genuine entanglement measure, minimal bipartition measure, and the minimal distance from the partite-wise separable states, respectively. The former two methods are far-ranging since all of them are defined by the reduced functions. Consequently, we establish the framework of the resource theory of the partite-wise entanglement and the genuine partite-wise entanglement for which the free states are the pure states and the states with pure reduced states, respectively.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise and topologies on multi-photon quantum protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-augmented networks aim to use quantum phenomena to improve detection and protection against malicious actors in a classical communication network. This may include multiplexing quantum signals into classical fiber optical channels and incorporating purely quantum links alongside classical links in the network. In such hybrid networks, quantum protocols based on single photons become a bottleneck for transmission distances and data speeds, thereby reducing entire network performance. Furthermore, many of the security assumptions of the single-photon protocols do not hold up in practice because of the impossibility of manufacturing single-photon emitters. Multi-photon quantum protocols, on the other hand, are designed to operate under practical assumptions and do not require single photon emitters. As a result, they provide higher levels of security guarantees and longer transmission distances. However, the effect of channel and device noise on multiphoton protocols in terms of security, transmission distances, and bit rates has not been investigated. In this paper, we focus on channel noise and present our observations on the effect of various types of noise on multi-photon protocols. We also investigate the effect of topologies such as ring, star, and torus on the noise characteristics of the multi-photon protocols. Our results show the possible advantages of switching to multi-photon protocols and give insights into the repeater placement and topology choice for quantum-augmented networks.</description>

      <title>Nullifiers of non-Gaussian cluster states through homodyne measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplexing potential of large-scale optical Gaussian cluster states was already experimentally demonstrated. Non-Gaussian states must be embedded in a cluster state to reach universality and fault tolerance. Basic quantum operations with the potential to induce non-Gaussianity, such as photon subtraction, start to broaden the available experimental toolbox as well. The interplay of the two, non-Gaussian multimode cluster states, remains challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we propose a framework for the characterization of non-Gaussian cluster states. In analogy to the nowadays frequently used Gaussian nullifiers, we define non-Gaussian nullifiers of cluster states that enable certification of non-Gaussianity in the cluster state. We illustrate the concept with an example of a cluster state created from photon-subtracted squeezed states. The nullifier can be evaluated from a homodyne measurement, which is a natural detection for optical cluster states.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics and dark particle in a weak-coupled quantum Ising ladder with $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent Ising$_h^2$ integrability is anticipated in a quantum Ising ladder composed of two weakly-coupled critical transverse field Ising chains. The system is remarkable for including eight types of massive relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and mass spectrum characterized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article, by computing the spin dynamical structure factors following analytical form factor approach, we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spectra, which is further confirmed by the numerical simulations. We show that the selection rule inherent in the parity and topological charge of the theory, causes a significant result that charge-parity-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations. This in turn suggests the long lifetime of the lightest dark particle.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Learning for Small Dataset Modeling in Semiconductor Fabrication: Application to Ohmic Contact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling complex semiconductor fabrication processes such as Ohmic contact formation remains challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. While classical machine learning (CML) approaches have been successful in many domains, their performance degrades in small-sample, nonlinear scenarios. In this work, we investigate quantum machine learning (QML) as an alternative, exploiting quantum kernels to capture intricate correlations from compact datasets. Using only 159 experimental GaN HEMT samples, we develop a quantum kernel-aligned regressor (QKAR) combining a shallow Pauli-Z feature map with a trainable quantum kernel alignment (QKA) layer. All models, including seven baseline CML regressors, are evaluated under a unified PCA-based preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair comparison. QKAR consistently outperforms classical baselines across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), achieving a mean absolute error of 0.338 Omega mm when validated on experimental data. We further assess noise robustness and generalization through cross-validation and new device fabrication. These findings suggest that carefully constructed QML models could provide predictive advantages in data-constrained semiconductor modeling, offering a foundation for practical deployment on near-term quantum hardware. While challenges remain for both QML and CML, this study demonstrates QML's potential as a complementary approach in complex process modeling tasks.</description>

Abstract: We examine the onset of Anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in the form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. Analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the Anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. Performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular Anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. Our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric current generation and its dissipation are important physical processes. It ranges from the one follows the Ohm's law to superconductivity. Recently, it has been shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions, and we consider its importance for the electric current conduction in this work. We first show that it rectifies the odd explanation in Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire: Poynting's theorem explains that the energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that this energy is supplied by the chemical potential gradient generated by the battery connection. Next, we consider the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation did not include the capacitor contribution. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force might explain the Planckian dissipation observed in high transition temperature cuprate superconductors. The present work suggests the rethinking of the gauge invariance in Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically develop a holographic entanglement thread picture that characterizes the entanglement structure of holographic duality. Behind this construction lies a simple philosophy: holographic quantum entanglement can be visualized by thread-like objects. Inspired by tensor network models and the earlier concept of bit threads, we propose rules governing the trajectories of entanglement threads in the holographic bulk. These rules not only carry meaningful interpretations at the level of quantum information theory but also determine that the entanglement threads travel along geodesics in the holographic bulk. This makes kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing holographic entanglement thread configurations. We hope that the holographic entanglement thread method can provide necessary constraints or useful guidance for constructing genuine holographic tensor networks beyond toy models.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between accelerated probes in a de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</description>
