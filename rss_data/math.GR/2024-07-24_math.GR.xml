      <title>Subgroup mixing and random walks in groups acting on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological dynamics of the action of an acylindrically hyperbolic group on the space of its infinite index convex cocompact subgroups by conjugation. We show that, for any suitable probability measure $\mu$, random walks with respect to $\mu$ will produce elements with strong mixing properties for this action asymptotically almost surely. In particular, when the group has no finite normal subgroups this implies that the action is highly topologically transitive. Along the way, we prove technical results about convex cocompact subgroups which allow us to extend some results on random walks of Abbott and the first author.</description>

      <title>Nil-extensions of simple and right $\pi$-inverse ordered semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordered semigroup $S$ is right $\pi$-inverse if it is $\pi$-inverse but not conversely. So the question arises under what condition the converse holds. In this paper we study nil-extensions of simple and right $\pi$-inverse ordered semigroups and prove that $S$ is right $\pi$-inverse if and only if $S$ is $\pi$-inverse in a $t$-Archimedean ordered semigroup. Moreover, we characterize complete semilattice of nil-extensions of simple and right $\pi$-inverse ordered semigroups.</description>

      <title>Maximal subgroups of maximal rank in the classical algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an arbitrary field. We classify the maximal reductive subgroups of maximal rank in any classical simple algebraic $k$-group in terms of combinatorial data associated to their indices. This result complements [S, 2022], which does the same for the exceptional groups. We determine which of these subgroups may be realised over a finite field, the real numbers, or over a $\mathfrak{p}$-adic field. We also look at the asymptotics of the number of such subgroups as the rank grows large.</description>

      <title>On overgroups of distinguished unipotent elements in reductive groups and finite groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a simple algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field of good characteristic $p$. In 2018 Korhonen showed that if $H$ is a connected reductive subgroup of $G$ which contains a distinguished unipotent element $u$ of $G$ of order $p$, then $H$ is $G$-irreducible in the sense of Serre. We present a short and uniform proof of this result using so-called good $A_1$ subgroups of $G$, introduced by Seitz. We also formulate a counterpart of Korhonen's theorem for overgroups of $u$ which are finite groups of Lie type. Moreover, we generalize both results above by removing the restriction on the order of $u$ under a mild condition on $p$ depending on the rank of $G$, and we present an analogue of Korhonen's theorem for Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>The cogrowth inequality from Whitehead's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on free factors $H\leq F_m$ of the free group $F_m$ with finite rank $m &gt; 2$, and specifically addresses the implications of Ascari's refinement of the Whitehead automorphism $\varphi$ for $H$ as introduced in \cite{ascari2021fine}. Ascari showed that if the core $\Delta_H$ of $H$ has more than one vertex, then the core $\Delta_{\varphi(H)}$ of $\varphi(H)$ can be derived from $\Delta_H$. We consider the regular language $L_H$ of reduced words from $F_m$ representing elements of $H$, and employ the construction of $\mathcal{B}_H$ described in \cite{DGS2021}. $\mathcal{B}_H$ is a finite ergodic, deterministic automaton that recognizes $L_H$. Extending Ascari's result, we show that for the aforementioned free factors $H$ of $F_m$, the automaton $\mathcal{B}_{\varphi(H)}$ can be obtained from $\mathcal{B}_H$. Further, we present a method for deriving the adjacency matrix of the transition graph of $\mathcal{B}_{\varphi(H)}$ from that of $\mathcal{B}_H$ and establish that $\alpha_H &lt; \alpha_{\varphi(H)}$, where $\alpha_H, \alpha_{\varphi(H)}$ represent the cogrowths of $H$ and $\varphi(H)$, respectively, with respect to a fixed basis $X$ of $F_m$. The proof is based on the Perron-Frobenius theory for non-negative matrices.</description>

      <title>Trace spaces of full free product $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the space of traces $\text{T}(A)$ of the unital full free product $A=A_1*A_2$ of two unital, separable $C^*$-algebras $A_1$ and $A_2$ is typically a Poulsen simplex, i.e., a simplex whose extreme points are dense. We deduce that $\text{T}(A)$ is a Poulsen simplex whenever $A_1$ and $A_2$ have no $1$-dimensional representations, e.g., if $A_1$ and $A_2$ are finite dimensional with no $1$-dimensional direct summands. Additionally, we characterize when the space of traces of a free product of two countable groups is a Poulsen simplex. Our main technical contribution is a new perturbation result for pairs of von Neumann subalgebras $(M_1,M_2)$ of a tracial von Neumann algebra $M$ which gives necessary conditions ensuring that $M_1$ and a small unitary perturbation of $M_2$ generate a II$_1$ factor.</description>

      <title>Regular polytopes of rank $n/2$ for transitive groups of degree $n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research established that the maximal rank of the abstract regular polytopes whose automorphism group is a transitive proper subgroup of $\Sym_n$ is $n/2 + 1$, with only two polytopes attaining this rank, both of which having odd ranks.
  In this paper, we investigate the case where the rank is equal to $n/2$ ($n\geq 14$). Our analysis reveals that reducing the rank by one results in a substantial increase in the number of regular polytopes ($33$ distinct families are discovered) covering all possible ranks (even and odd).</description>

      <title>Algebraic Adversarial Attacks on Integrated Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on explainability models have drastic consequences when explanations are used to understand the reasoning of neural networks in safety critical systems. Path methods are one such class of attribution methods susceptible to adversarial attacks. Adversarial learning is typically phrased as a constrained optimisation problem. In this work, we propose algebraic adversarial examples and study the conditions under which one can generate adversarial examples for integrated gradients. Algebraic adversarial examples provide a mathematically tractable approach to adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>Representations of the symmetric group are decomposable in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to decompose orthogonal matrix representations of the symmetric group over the reals into irreducible representations, which as a by-product also computes the multiplicities of the irreducible representations. The algorithm applied to a $d$-dimensional representation of $S_n$ is shown to have a complexity of $O(n^2 d^3)$ operations for determining which irreducible representations are present and their corresponding multiplicities and a further $O(n d^4)$ operations to fully decompose representations with non-trivial multiplicities. These complexity bounds are pessimistic and in a practical implementation using floating point arithmetic and exploiting sparsity we observe better complexity. We demonstrate this algorithm on the problem of computing multiplicities of two tensor products of irreducible representations (the Kronecker coefficients problem) as well as higher order tensor products. For hook and hook-like irreducible representations the algorithm has polynomial complexity as $n$ increases. We also demonstrate an application to constructing a basis of multivariate orthogonal polynomials with respect to a tensor product weight so that applying a permutation of variables induces an irreducible representation.</description>

      <title>Isotypical equivalence of periodic Abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give invariants that characterize isotypically equivalent Abelian periodic groups. Also, we describe types of standart tuples of elements in these groups. As the particular case we prove that two Abelian $p$-groups with separable reduced parts are isotypically equivalent if and only if their divisible parts and their basic subgroups are elementarily equivalent. Also as a corollary we prove that any Abelian $p$-group with a separable reduced part is $\omega$-strongly homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Acylindrical hyperbolicity and the centers of Artin groups that are not free of infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charney and Morris-Wright showed acylindrical hyperbolicity of Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not joins, by studying clique-cube complexes and the actions on them. The authors developed their study and clarified when acylindrical hyperbolicity holds for Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not cones. In this paper, we introduce reduced clique-cube complexes. By using them, we show acylindrical hyperbolicity of irreducible Artin groups associated with graphs that are not cliques, that is, irreducible Artin groups that are not free of infinity. Such Artin groups contain infinite type Artin groups of type FC. As an application, we see that the centers of such Artin groups are finite, and that actually they are trivial in many cases.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphism groups of telescoping 2-manifolds are strongly distorted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the work of Mann and Rafi, we introduce an expanded definition of a telescoping 2-manifold and proceed to study the homeomorphism group of a telescoping 2-manifold. Our main result shows that it is strongly distorted. We then give a simple description of its commutator subgroup, which is index one, two, or four depending on the topology of the manifold. Moreover, we show its commutator subgroup is uniformly perfect with commutator width at most two, and we give a family of uniform normal generators for its commutator subgroup. As a consequence of the latter result, we show that for an (orientable) telescoping 2-manifold, every (orientation-preserving) homeomorphism can be expressed as a product of at most 17 conjugate involutions. Finally, we provide analogous statements for mapping class groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an analogue of topological boundary of discrete groups $\Gamma$, we define the noncommutative topological boundary of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M,\tau)$ and apply it to generalize the main results of [AHO23], showing that for a trace preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright(A,\tau_A)$ on an amenable tracial von Neumann algebra, a $\Gamma$-invariant measure $\mu\in\mathrm{Prob}(\mathrm{SA}(\Gamma\ltimes A))$ supported on amenable intermediate subalgebras between $A$ and $\Gamma\ltimes A$ is necessary supported on the subalgebras of $\mathrm{Rad}(\Gamma)\ltimes A$. By taking $(A,\tau)=L^\infty(X,\nu_X)$ for a free p.m.p. action $\Gamma \curvearrowright(X,\nu_X)$, we obtain a similar results for the invariant random subequivalence relations of $\mathcal{R}_{\Gamma \curvearrowright X}$.</description>
