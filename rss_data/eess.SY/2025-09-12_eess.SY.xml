      <title>Bridging Centralized and Distributed Frameworks in Unknown Input Observer Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation for linear time-invariant systems with unknown inputs is a fundamental problem in various research domains. In this article, we establish conditions for the design of unknown input observers (UIOs) from a geometric approach perspective. Specifically, we derive a necessary and sufficient geometric condition for the existence of a centralized UIO. Compared to existing results, our condition offers a more general design framework, allowing designers the flexibility to estimate partial information of the system state. Furthermore, we extend the centralized UIO design to distributed settings. In contrast to existing distributed UIO approaches, which require each local node to satisfy the rank condition regarding the unknown input and output matrices, our method accommodates cases where a subset of nodes does not meet this requirement. This relaxation significantly broadens the range of practical applications. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Identifying Pareto-Efficient Coordination -- A Distributionally Robust Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to identify Pareto-efficient behavior in a multi-agent system, and reconstruct utility functions of the individual agents. Motivated by the problem of detecting UAV coordination, how can we construct a statistical detector for Pareto-efficient behavior given noisy measurements of the decisions of a multi-agent system? This paper approaches this IRL problem by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for a dataset of multi-agent system dynamics to be consistent with Pareto-efficient coordination, and providing algorithms for recovering utility functions which are consistent with the system dynamics. We derive an optimal statistical detector for determining Pareto-efficient coordination from noisy system measurements, which minimizes Type-I statistical detection error. Then, we provide a utility estimation algorithm which minimizes the worst-case estimation error over a statistical ambiguity set centered at empirical observations; this min-max solution achieves distributionally robust IRL, which is crucial in adversarial strategic interactions. We illustrate these results in a detailed example for detecting Pareto-efficient coordination among multiple UAVs given noisy measurement recorded at a radar. We then reconstruct the utility functions of the UAVs in a distributionally robust sense.</description>

      <title>Efficient High-Order Participation Factor Computation via Batch-Structured Tensor Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Participation factors (PFs) quantify the interaction between system modes and state variables, and they play a crucial role in various applications such as modal analysis, model reduction, and control design. With increasing system complexity, especially due to power electronic devices and renewable integration, the need for scalable and high-order nonlinear PF (NPF) computation has become more critical. This paper presents an efficient tensor-based method for calculating NPFs up to an arbitrary order. Traditional computation of PFs directly from normal form theory is computationally expensive -- even for second-order PFs -- and becomes infeasible for higher orders due to memory constraints. To address this, a tensor contraction-based approach is introduced that enables the calculation of high-order PFs using a batching strategy. The batch sizes are dynamically determined based on the available computational resources, allowing scalable and memory-efficient computation.</description>

      <title>Design of Reliable and Resilient Electric Power Systems for Wide-Body All-Electric Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, all-electric transportation is a promising option. In the U.S., the transportation sector contributes the largest share (29 percent) of greenhouse gas emissions. While electric vehicles are approaching maturity, aviation is only beginning to develop electrified aircraft for commercial flights. More than 75 percent of aviation emissions come from large aircraft, and this impact will worsen with 4-5 percent annual air travel growth. Aircraft electrification has led to two types: more electric aircraft (MEA) and all-electric aircraft (AEA). A MEA replaces subsystems such as hydraulics with electric alternatives, whereas an AEA uses electrically driven subsystems and provides thrust fully from electrochemical energy units (EEUs). For wide-body AEA, thrust demand is about 25 MW plus 1 MW for non-thrust loads, creating major challenges for electric power system (EPS) design. Achieving maximum power density requires minimizing mass and volume. Increasing voltage into the kilovolt range using medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) is a feasible option to enhance power transfer. Consequently, designing an MVDC EPS for wide-body AEA is critical. Because EPS failures could jeopardize passenger safety, reliability and resilience are essential. This chapter presents a load-flow model for DC systems to determine power flows in both normal and single-contingency conditions, followed by analysis of optimal MVDC EPS architectures. A complete EPS for wide-body AEA is introduced, with EEUs and non-propulsion loads located, distances estimated, and flow studies performed. Multiple architectures are evaluated for reliability, power density, power loss, and cost to identify optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Local Voltage Control for Active Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution networks face challenges from the increasing deployment of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and the emergence of bidirectional power flows. We propose a decentralized Volt/VAr control method based on a saddle-point reformulation and consensus+innovation (C+I) updates. Each agent at a controllable bus computes and enforces its own set-points using only neighbor communication. Our method embeds passive buses directly, preserves network physics through a linearized Jacobian model, and avoids any supervisory nodes. Simulation results on a modified CIGRE low-voltage network show voltage stability improvement within operational limits, indicating the viability of a fully decentralized (edge-based) Volt/VAr control solution.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an SIR Model with Noncompliance as a Social Contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a compartmental model for epidemiology with human behavioral effects. Specifically, our model incorporates governmental prevention measures aimed at lowering the disease infection rate, but we split the population into those who comply with the measures and those who do not comply and therefore do not receive the reduction in infectivity. We then allow the attitude of noncompliance to spread as a social contagion parallel to the disease. We derive the reproductive ratio for our model and provide stability analysis for the disease-free equilibria. We then propose a control scenario wherein a policy-maker with access to control variables representing disease prevention mandates, treatment efforts, and educational campaigns aimed at encouraging compliance minimizes a cost functional incorporating several cost concerns. We characterize optimal controls via the Pontryagin optimality principle and present simulations which demonstrate the behavior of the control maps in several different parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>KAN-Therm: A Lightweight Battery Thermal Model Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery management systems (BMSs) rely on real-time estimation of battery temperature distribution in battery cells to ensure safe and optimal operation of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, physical BMS often suffers from memory and computational resource limitations required by highfidelity models. Temperature prediction using physics-based models becomes challenging due to their higher computational time. In contrast, machine learning based approaches offer faster predictions but demand larger memory overhead. In this work, we develop a lightweight and efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) based thermal model, KAN-Therm, to predict the core temperature of a cylindrical battery. We have compared the memory overhead and computation costs of our method with Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long shortterm memory (LSTM) network. Our results show that the proposed KAN-Therm model exhibit the best prediction accuracy with the least memory overhead and computation time.</description>

      <title>Voltage Synchronization and Proportional Current Sharing of Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most previously proposed controllers are analyzed in the small-signal/quasi-steady regime rather than large-signal or transient stability for grid-forming inverters (GFMI). Additionally, methods that presume system-wide data--global measurements and complete grid-model knowledge--are challenging to realize in practice and unsuitable for large-scale operation. Moreover, proportional current sharing is rarely embedded into them. The whole system is a high-order, nonlinear differential system, making analysis intractable without principled simplifications. Hence, contraction stability analysis in GFMI is proposed to guarantee the large-signal stability. Furthermore, a contraction-based controller is proposed to synchronize GFMI. Additionally, this paper proposes integrating an auxiliary virtual-impedance layer into the contraction-based controller to achieve proportional current sharing, while the GFMI retains global stability and voltage synchronization. A dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC), also known as the Andronov--Hopf oscillator (AHO) is used to validate the proposed contraction stability analysis and contraction-based controller with virtual-impedance. It is proved that the complex multi-converter system can achieve output-feedback contraction under large-signal operation. Therefore, without requiring system-wide data, the proposed method offers voltage synchronization, decentralized stability conditions for the transient stability of AHO and proportional current sharing, beyond prior small-signal, quasi-steady analysis.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Secure Cloud Control Systems: Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked Control Systems (NCSs) have been instrumental in realizing fully connected and responsive intelligent environments within the context of real-time virtual control and management. However, traditional NCSs face considerable challenges in handling the vast amounts of data generated by large-scale control applications, particularly in terms of data acquisition, storage, and computational processing. To address these challenges, the emergence of cloud computing and advancements in control theory have empowered the new paradigm known as Cloud Control Systems (CCSs). Recently, CCSs have received substantial attention from industries for their potential properties, such as large-scale data management, complex computations, and data-centric optimized decisions. This study presents an extensive review of recent progress in CCSs spanning over multiple studies published between 2012 and 2025. Specifically, the focus is on providing a taxonomy of the current findings in CCS research, encompassing various perspectives, such as its efficient implementations in industrial automation, security and privacy considerations, and cloud-based control techniques. Each category is examined in depth through selected state-of-the-art analyses of different approaches and contrasting methodologies. Furthermore, we discuss future directions aimed at designing more efficient and practical CCSs. The insights gained from this study can help researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers in their domain for effective CCS design and deployment.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Robust and Reliable Designs Using the Compromised Design Support Problem: A Case Study in Hot Rod Rolling Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design under uncertainty is a challenging problem, as a systems performance can be highly sensitive to variations in input parameters and model uncertainty. A conventional approach to addressing such problems is robust optimization, which seeks to enhance design performance by reducing sensitivity to uncertainty. Alternatively, reliability-based design focuses on optimizing performance while ensuring that failure constraints are satisfied with a specified probability. While both methods are well established, their integration into multi-objective and multi-stakeholder decision-making frameworks remains a challenging problem. In this study, we extend the Compromise Decision Support Problem (cDSP) framework to incorporate reliability-based design considerations and evaluate its performance in comparison to the conventional robust-based cDSP formulation. The developed framework has been validated on a multidisciplinary hot rod rolling process including parametric and model uncertainties. The results compare the predicted performance under robust and reliable scenarios, validating the efficiency of the approach in managing uncertainties for complex, multidisciplinary systems. Specifically, we found that the two methods exhibit markedly different performance when the predicted performance follows a non-normal distribution, a situation that arises in non-linear systems with parametric uncertainty. Based on this insight, we offer guidance to designers on the conditions under which each method is most appropriate.</description>

      <title>Taming Spontaneous Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Computational Mechanism Design Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that stop-and-go waves can be generated spontaneously in traffic even without bottlenecks. Can such undesirable traffic patterns, induced by intrinsic human driving behaviors, be tamed effectively and inexpensively? Taking advantage of emerging connectivity and autonomy technologies, we envision a simple yet realistic traffic control system to achieve this goal. To prove the concept, we design such a system to suppress these waves while maximizing traffic throughput in the Tadaki setting: a circular road with varying number of vehicles. We first introduce our driver behavior model and demonstrate how our calibrated human driving agents can closely reproduce the observed human driving patterns in the original Tadaki experiment. We then propose a simple control system mediated via connected automated vehicles (CAV) whose ideal speed parameter is treated as a system-level control variable adapted to the local vehicle density of the traffic. The objective of the control system is set up as a tradeoff: maximizing throughput while minimizing traffic oscillation. Following computational mechanism design, we search for the optimal control policy as a function of vehicle density and the tradeoff attitude parameter. This can be done by letting all vehicles play a simulated game of CAV-modulated traffic under such a control system. Our simulation results show that the improvements in traffic efficiency and smoothness are substantial. Finally, we envision how such a traffic control system can be realized in an environment with smart vehicles connected to a smart infrastructure or via a scheme of variable speed advisory.</description>

      <title>Taming Spontaneous Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Bifurcation Perspective of A Dynamical Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time dynamical system in a car-following context. The system was recently introduced to parsimoniously model human driving behavior based on utility maximization. The parameters of the model were calibrated using vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. It was shown that such a system can accurately reproduce the observed collective phenomena of a more elaborate experiment by Tadaki et al. Once the heterogeneity and noise are switched off, the model defines a map of the corresponding discrete-time dynamical system. We first perform a bifurcation analysis of the map by studying the stability of its limit solutions: a free-flow fixed point and a stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. When the vehicle density is varied, our model displays a bifurcation diagram qualitatively similar to those found in a class of optimal velocity models based on an ordinary differential equation approach, including regimes where one or both of the limit solutions are stable. In a 2D bifurcation diagram we further demonstrate that imposing a vehicle density-dependent speed advisory can dissipate the stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. This in turn lays the mathematical foundation for a simple, yet effective proposal [1] to tame stop-and-go waves, improving traffic flow and smoothness simultaneously via variable speed advisory.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Data-Assisted Port-Hamiltonian Control for Free-Floating Space Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic data-assisted control architecture within the port-Hamiltonian framework is proposed, introducing a physically meaningful observable that links conservative dynamics to all actuation, dissipation, and disturbance channels. A robust, model-based controller combined with a high-gain decentralized integrator establishes large robustness margins and strict time-scale separation, ensuring that subsequent learning cannot destabilize the primary dynamics. Learning, selected for its generalizability, is then applied to capture complex, unmodeled effects, despite inherent delay and transient error during adaptation. Formal Lyapunov analysis with explicit stability bounds guarantees convergence under bounded learning errors. The structured design confines learning to the simplest part of the dynamics, enhancing data efficiency while preserving physical interpretability. The approach is generic, with a free-floating space manipulator orientation control task, including integrated null-space collision avoidance, serving as a case study to demonstrate robust tracking performance and applicability to broader robotic domains.</description>

      <title>A neural drift-plus-penalty algorithm for network power allocation and routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drift-plus-penalty method is a Lyapunov optimisation technique commonly applied to network routing problems. It reduces the original stochastic planning task to a sequence of greedy optimizations, enabling the design of distributed routing algorithms which stabilize data queues while simultaneously optimizing a specified penalty function. While drift-plus-penalty methods have desirable asymptotic properties, they tend to incur higher network delay than alternative control methods, especially under light network load. In this work, we propose a learned variant of the drift-plus-penalty method that can preserve its theoretical guarantees, while being flexible enough to learn routing strategies directly from a model of the problem. Our approach introduces a novel mechanism for learning routing decisions and employs an optimal transport-based method for link scheduling. Applied to the joint task of transmit-power allocation and data routing, the method achieves consistent improvements over common baselines under a broad set of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Corruption-Tolerant Asynchronous Q-Learning with Near-Optimal Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted, infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption, the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning, bridging a significant gap in robust RL.</description>

      <title>Toward a Multi-Echelon Cyber Warfare Theory: A Meta-Game-Theoretic Paradigm for Defense and Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber warfare has become a central element of modern conflict, especially within multi-domain operations. As both a distinct and critical domain, cyber warfare requires integrating defensive and offensive technologies into coherent strategies. While prior research has emphasized isolated tactics or fragmented technologies, a holistic understanding is essential for effective resource deployment and risk mitigation. Game theory offers a unifying framework for this purpose. It not only models attacker-defender interactions but also provides quantitative tools for equilibrium analysis, risk assessment, and strategic reasoning. Integrated with modern AI techniques, game-theoretic models enable the design and optimization of strategies across multiple levels of cyber warfare, from policy and strategy to operations, tactics, and technical implementations. These models capture the paradoxical logic of conflict, where more resources do not always translate into greater advantage, and where nonlinear dynamics govern outcomes. To illustrate the approach, this chapter examines RedCyber, a synthetic cyber conflict, demonstrating how game-theoretic methods capture the interdependencies of cyber operations. The chapter concludes with directions for future research on resilience, cros-echelon planning, and the evolving role of AI in cyber warfare.</description>

      <title>Regularization in Data-driven Predictive Control: A Convex Relaxation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the role of regularization in data-driven predictive control (DDPC) through the lens of convex relaxation. Using a bi-level optimization framework, we model system identification as an inner problem and predictive control as an outer problem. Within this framework, we show that several regularized DDPC formulations, including l1-norm penalties, projection-based regularizers, and a newly introduced causality-based regularizer, can be viewed as convex relaxations of their respective bi-level problems. This perspective clarifies the conceptual links between direct and indirect data-driven control and highlights how regularization implicitly enforces system identification. We further propose an optimality-based variant, O-DDPC, which approximately solves the inner problem with all identification constraints via an iterative algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that O-DDPC outperforms existing regularized DDPC by reducing both bias and variance errors. These results indicate that further benefits may be obtained by applying system identification techniques to pre-process the trajectory library in nonlinear settings. Overall, our analysis contributes to a unified convex relaxation view of regularization in DDPC and sheds light on its strong empirical performance beyond linear time-invariant systems.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a 8-bit Wallace Tree Multiplier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wallace tree multipliers are a parallel digital multiplier architecture designed to minimize the worst-case time complexity of the circuit depth relative to the input size [1]. In particular, it seeks to perform long multiplication in the binary sense, reducing as many partial products per stage as possible through full and half adders circuits, achieving O(log(n)) where n = bit length of input. This paper provides an overview of the design, progress and methodology in the final project of ECE 55900, consisting of the schematic and layout of a Wallace tree 8-bit input multiplier on the gpdk45 technology in Cadence Virtuoso, as well as any design attempts prior to the final product. This also includes our endeavors in designing the final MAC (Multiply Accumulate) unit with undefined targets, which we chose to implement as a 16 bit combinational multiply-add.</description>

      <title>Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View (FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions. Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency, safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>The role of communication delays in the optimal control of spatially invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal proportional feedback controllers for spatially invariant systems when the controller has access to delayed state measurements received from different spatial locations. We analyze how delays affect the spatial locality of the optimal feedback gain leveraging the problem decoupling in the spatial frequency domain. For the cases of expensive control and small delay, we provide exact expressions of the optimal controllers in the limit for infinite control weight and vanishing delay, respectively. In the expensive control regime, the optimal feedback control law decomposes into a delay-aware filtering of the delayed state and the optimal controller in the delay-free setting. Under small delays, the optimal controller is a perturbation of the delay-free one which depends linearly on the delay. We illustrate our analytical findings with a reaction-diffusion process over the real line and a multi-agent system coupled through circulant matrices, showing that delays reduce the effectiveness of optimal feedback control and may require each subsystem within a distributed implementation to communicate with farther-away locations.</description>

      <title>BagIt! An Adaptive Dual-Arm Manipulation of Fabric Bags for Object Bagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bagging tasks, commonly found in industrial scenarios, are challenging considering deformable bags' complicated and unpredictable nature. This paper presents an automated bagging system from the proposed adaptive Structure-of-Interest (SOI) manipulation strategy for dual robot arms. The system dynamically adjusts its actions based on real-time visual feedback, removing the need for pre-existing knowledge of bag properties. Our framework incorporates Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for estimating SOI states, optimization techniques for SOI generation, motion planning via Constrained Bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (CBiRRT), and dual-arm coordination using Model Predictive Control (MPC). Extensive experiments validate the capability of our system to perform precise and robust bagging across various objects, showcasing its adaptability. This work offers a new solution for robotic deformable object manipulation (DOM), particularly in automated bagging tasks.

      <title>ObjectReact: Learning Object-Relative Control for Visual Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level "WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world indoor environments.

      <title>Tannenbaum's gain-margin optimization meets Polyak's heavy-ball algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper highlights an apparent, yet relatively unknown link, between algorithm design in optimization theory and control synthesis in robust control. Specifically, quadratic optimization can be recast as a regulation problem within the frame of $H_\infty$ control. From this vantage point, the optimality of Polyak's fastest heavy-ball algorithm can be ascertained as a solution to a gain margin optimization problem. The approach is independent of Polyak's original and brilliant argument, and relies on foundational work by Tannenbaum who introduced and solved gain margin optimization via Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theory. The link between first-order optimization methods and robust control sheds new light into the limits of algorithmic performance of such methods, and suggests a framework where similar computational tasks can be systematically studied and algorithms optimized. In particular, it raises the question as to whether periodically scheduled algorithms can achieve faster rates for quadratic optimization, in a manner analogous to periodic control that extends gain margin beyond that of time-invariant control. This turns out not to be the case, due to the analytic obstruction of a transmission zero that is inherent in causal schemes. Interestingly, this obstruction can be removed with implicit algorithms, cast as feedback regulation problems with causal, but not strictly causal dynamics, thereby devoid of the transmission zero at infinity and able to achieve superior convergence rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (S-NOD) is an excitable decision-making model inspired by the spiking dynamics of neurons. S-NOD enables the design of agile decision-making that can rapidly switch between decision options in response to a changing environment. In S-NOD, decisions are represented by discrete opinion spikes that evolve in continuous time. Here, we extend previous analysis of S-NOD and explore its potential as a nonlinear controller with a tunable balance between robustness and responsiveness to input. We identify and provide necessary conditions for the bifurcation that determines the onset of periodic opinion spiking. We leverage this analysis to characterize the tunability of the input-output threshold for opinion spiking as a function of the model basal sensitivity and the tunable dependence of opinion spiking frequency on input magnitude above the threshold. We conclude with a discussion of S-NOD as a new neuromorphic control block and its extension to distributed spiking controllers.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reachability with Scenario Optimization and the Holdout Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reachability analysis is an important method in providing safety guarantees for systems with unknown or uncertain dynamics. Due to the computational intractability of exact reachability analysis for general nonlinear, high-dimensional systems, recent work has focused on the use of probabilistic methods for computing approximate reachable sets. In this work, we advocate for the use of a general purpose, practical, and sharp method for data-driven reachability: the holdout method. Despite the simplicity of the holdout method, we show -- on several numerical examples including scenario-based reach tubes -- that the resulting probabilistic bounds are substantially sharper and require fewer samples than existing methods for data-driven reachability. Furthermore, we complement our work with a discussion on the necessity of probabilistic reachability bounds. We argue that any method that attempts to de-randomize the bounds, by converting the guarantees to hold deterministically, requires (a) an exponential in state-dimension amount of samples to achieve non-vacuous guarantees, and (b) extra assumptions on the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a design of low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), low symbol error rate (SER), and high data rate signal for optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed design leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) incorporating gradual loss learning to jointly optimize the geometry and probability of the constellation's symbols. This not only enhances mutual information (MI) but also effectively reduces the PAPR while maintaining a low SER for reliable transmission. We evaluate the performance of the proposed VAE-based design by comparing the MI, SER, and PAPR against existing techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerably lower PAPR while maintaining superior SER and MI performance for a wide range of SNRs.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and Commuting Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework offers a way to represent a nonlinear system as a linear one. The key to this simplification lies in the identification of eigenfunctions. While various data-driven algorithms have been developed for this problem, a theoretical characterization of Koopman eigenfunctions from geometric properties of the flow is still missing. This paper provides such a characterization by establishing an equivalence between a set of Koopman eigenfunctions and a set of commuting symmetries -- both assumed to span the tangent spaces at every point on a simply connected open set. Based on this equivalence, we build an explicit and convergent formula for the principal Koopman eigenfunctions defined on the region of attraction of a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, thereby offering a constructive formula to compute Koopman eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Single-Stage Optimization of Open-loop Stable Limit Cycles with Smooth, Symbolic Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-loop stable limit cycles are foundational to legged robotics, providing inherent self-stabilization that minimizes the need for computationally intensive feedback-based gait correction. While previous methods have primarily targeted specific robotic models, this paper introduces a general framework for rapidly generating limit cycles across various dynamical systems, with the flexibility to impose arbitrarily tight stability bounds. We formulate the problem as a single-stage constrained optimization problem and use Direct Collocation to transcribe it into a nonlinear program with closed-form expressions for constraints, objectives, and their gradients.
  Our method supports multiple stability formulations. In particular, we tested two popular formulations for limit cycle stability in robotics: (1) based on the spectral radius of a discrete return map, and (2) based on the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix, and tested five different constraint-satisfaction formulations of the eigenvalue problem to bound the spectral radius. We compare the performance and solution quality of the various formulations on a robotic swing-leg model, highlighting the Schur decomposition of the monodromy matrix as a method with broader applicability due to weaker assumptions and stronger numerical convergence properties.
  As a case study, we apply our method on a hopping robot model, generating open-loop stable gaits in under 2 seconds on an Intel Core i7-6700K, while simultaneously minimizing energy consumption even under tight stability constraints.</description>

      <title>A Fundamental Convergence Rate Bound for Gradient Based Online Optimization Algorithms with Exact Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider algorithms with integral action for solving online optimization problems characterized by quadratic cost functions with a time-varying optimal point described by an $(n-1)$th order polynomial. Using a version of the internal model principle, the optimization algorithms under consideration are required to incorporate a discrete time $n$-th order integrator in order to achieve exact tracking. By using results on an optimal gain margin problem, we obtain a fundamental convergence rate bound for the class of linear gradient based algorithms exactly tracking a time-varying optimal point. This convergence rate bound is given by $ \left(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa} - 1 }{\sqrt{\kappa} + 1}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number for the set of cost functions under consideration. Using our approach, we also construct algorithms which achieve the optimal convergence rate as well as zero steady-state error when tracking a time-varying optimal point.</description>
