      <title>Identification of the transport regimes of the one-dimensional Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Holstein model is a benchmark model of systems with electron-phonon interaction. However, its electrical transport properties are not yet fully understood. In this work, we performed numerically exact calculations of imaginary-time current-current correlation function of the Holstein Hamiltonian for a broad range of model parameters. These calculations were performed using a path-integral based Quantum Monte Carlo method. We compared these results with the results obtained under the assumption of conventional band transport, small polaron hopping and polaron band transport. From this comparison we identified the regions in parameter space where each of these transport regimes is valid. In some cases when imaginary-time comparison of current-current correlation functions could not give conclusive results, we complemented them with real-time comparisons or the comparison with literature data on numerically exact dc mobilities. Overall, we found that the parameter space is almost completely covered by the three mentioned transport regimes.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Magnonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, in contrast to their periodic counterparts, lack strict periodicity which gives rise to complex and localised spin wave spectra characterized by numerous band gaps and fractal features. Despite their intrinsic structural complexity, quasiperiodic nature of these magnonic crystals enables better tunability of spin wave spectra over their periodic counterparts and therefore holds promise for the applications in reprogrammable magnonic devices. In this article, we provide an overview of magnetization reversal and precessional magnetization dynamics studied so far in various quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, illustrating how their quasiperiodic nature gives rise to tailored band structure, enabling unparalleled control over spin waves. The review is concluded by highlighting the possible potential applications of these quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, exploring potential avenues for future exploration followed by a brief summary.</description>

      <title>Rectification of Vibrational Energy Transfer in Driven Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the combination of molecular chirality and phase controlled driving can lead to rectification of vibrational energy transfer. We demonstrate this effect using classical models of (1) a single helical chain and (2) a more realistic model of polyethylene double helix. We examine the effect of the driving frequency, polarization, and temperature on this phenomenon. Notably, we find that the direction and magnitude of the observed directionality preference depends on the driving frequency and phase, and that the effect persists at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Hidden ferromagnetism of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and orbital magnetism (OM). Nevertheless, $\mathcal{T}$ can be also broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest ferromagnetic one, i.e. within a minimal unit cell containing only one magnetic cite. We show that such presentation is possible due to the special form of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry, combined with the lattice translations, imposes a severe constraint on the form of the SO interaction, which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}| {\bf t} \}$, combining the $180^{\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\mathcal{S}$) with the lattice shift ${\bf t}$, connecting antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets, which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to the local coordinate frame with one magnetic cite per cell. It naturally explains the emergence of AHE and OM, and provides transparent expressions for these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating between nearest neighbors as well as the orthorhombic strain of the next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. The idea is illustrated on a number of examples, using realistic models derived from first-principles calculations. These examples include two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the tetragonal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Shot noise as a probe for Andreev reflection in graphene-based heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shot noise emerges due to the discrete nature of charge transport and provides direct access to the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms governing current flow in mesoscopic conductors. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum shot noise offers a direct and robust fingerprint of Andreev reflection, distinguishing between retro and specular processes in graphene-superconductor, graphene-superconductor-graphene, and superconductor-graphene-superconductor junctions. At the graphene-superconductor interface, exact reflection amplitudes obtained from full wavefunction matching within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism capture retro and specular regimes. The associated Fano factor exhibits distinct Fermi-level-dependent signatures, with retro Andreev reflection suppressing and specular Andreev reflection enhancing the shot noise. Extensions to graphene-superconductor-graphene and superconductor-graphene-superconductor configurations reveal how the transmission spectrum and, consequently, the noise profile are modified in the presence of multiple interfaces, coherent quasiparticle interference, and superconducting phase variations. Our findings establish shot noise spectroscopy as a potent and experimentally viable probe for differentiating Andreev reflection types in graphene-based quantum devices, providing complementary insights beyond conventional conductance measurements.</description>

      <title>Conductive domain walls in ferroelectrics as tunable coherent THz radiation source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: THz emission associated with currents in conductive domains in BiFeO$_3$ following infrared radiation is theoretically investigated. This experimentally observed phenomenon is explained by the domain wall stripes acting as metallic resonators with the oscillating charge accumulation being at the domain wall edges. The charge oscillation frequency is related to the plasma frequency inside the domain wall. The value of plasma frequency determines both the frequency and the amplitude of the emission emanating from the BiFeO$_3$ lattice. We show that for certain geometries of the domain wall structure and for specific polarization of the incident pulse the THz emission embodies a non-vanishing chirality.</description>

      <title>Generalized R\'enyi Entropy Production Rate in Non-equilibrium Systems: From Markov Processes to Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the entropy production rate is proposed $\Pi_q$ in non-equilibrium systems by extending the formalism of classical stochastic thermodynamics to regimes with non-Gaussian fluctuations. Through the R\'enyi entropy $S_q$ , where entropic parameter $q$ modulates critical fluctuations, it is defined $\Pi_q$ and the postulated generalized $q$-affinity ${\cal A}_q$ for Markov processes, where it is demonstrated that $\Pi_q \geq 0$, generalizing the second thermodynamics law.The derived formal framework was applied to the R\"ossler model, a nonlinear dynamical system exhibiting chaos. Numerical simulations show that the entropy production rate $\Pi_q$ can be used as an index of robustness and complexity by quantitatively corroborating the greater robustness of funnel-type chaos compared to spiral-type chaos. Our results reveal limitations of Gibbs-Shannon entropy in capturing non-Gaussian fluctuations induced by nonlinearity. On the contrary, it is found that $\Pi_q$ it can be a suitable magnitude to measure the intensity of chaotic dynamics through the entropy parameter $q$ , indicating a plausible link with Lyapunov exponents. The proposed formal framework extends the scope of stochastic thermodynamics to complex systems, integrating chaotic dynamics and the role of the entropic index q as a source of irreversibility and in capturing non-Gaussian contributions to entropy production.</description>

      <title>Theory for the spectral splitting exponent of exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.</description>

      <title>General structure factor and dynamic effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in S = 1/2 clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has become increasingly important in the context of nanoscale magnetism and spintronics. In this study, we derive a general structure factor equation for an S = 1/2 dimer and show that the anisotropic ratio $D_z/|J|$ and complex phase $\phi$ of the DMI control the gap energy and intensity of the $|0,0\rangle \to |1,0\rangle$ transition. {Using exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg spin-spin Hamiltonian that incorporates both isotropic and anisotropic interactions,} as well as the effects of an external magnetic field and an electric field. Our results show that the DM interaction splits energy eigenstates, induces level repulsion, and significantly modifies the spin dimer structure factor. These effects reveal a direct correspondence between thermodynamic anomalies in the heat capacity and spin-resolved selection rules.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Thermoelectricity via Engineered van Hove Singularities and Nernst Effect in Moir\'e Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02548v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moir\'e band engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D moir\'e structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient. Our results establish moir\'e superlattices as a versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of Lord Kelvins isentropic cooling and heating expression in tensile bars for two engineering alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solids when rapidly and elastically stressed change temperature, the effect proposed by Lord Kelvin is adiabatic thermo-elastic cooling or heating depending on the sign of the stress. A fast sensitive IR camera has measured temperature both decreasing and increasing. Temperature measurements made from the reversible, elastic part of the stress-strain curve during fast uniaxial tensile loading have been investigated. The isentropic temperature cooling from the loading curve is recovered by heating after the specimen fractures when the load is released. These measurements establish for the first time isentropic thermal recovery in two engineering alloys. The materials tested are an AISI 4340 steel and an aluminum 2024 alloy. Measurements of the isentropic thermo-elastic stress cooling are -0.61 K/GPa for steel and -1.7 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic thermo-elastic stress heating is -1.16 K/GPa for steel and -1.6 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic, elastic part of the temperature is fully recoverable even after extensive plastic deformation upon fracture.</description>

      <title>Cluster dynamics in macroscopic photoactive particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the collective behavior of macroscopic self-propelled particles that are externally excited by light. This property allows testing the system response to the excitation intensity in a very versatile manner. We discover that for low excitation intensities, clustering at the boundaries is always present, even when this is prevented by implementing flower-shaped confining walls. For high excitation intensities, however, clusters are dissolved more or less easily depending on their size. Then, a thorough analysis of the cluster dynamics allows us to depict a phase diagram depending on the number of agents in the arena and the excitation intensity. To explain this, we introduce a simple kinetic model where cluster evolution is governed by a balance between adsorption and desorption processes. Interestingly, this simple model is able to reproduce the phase space observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power and a linkage between higher-dimensional field theory and transport phenomena is proposed. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-M{\o}ller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range. The construction is gauge invariant, behaves consistently under limiting conditions, and can be matched to experimental stopping data through a single effective normalization constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cadmium telluride (CdTe), lead sulfide (PbS), and indium tin oxide (ITO) play crucial roles in various electronic applications where laser treatment enables precise modification of their distinctive electronic characteristics. This study utilizes the XTANT-3 hybrid/multiscale model to investigate the microscopic response of these materials to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The model simultaneously traces intertwined processes of non-equilibrium dynamics of both electrons and atoms, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials exhibit nonthermal melting at higher doses. When accounting for energy dissipation pathways and material recrystallization processes, damage thresholds increase substantially. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the resulting cooled material becomes increasingly amorphous, progressively reducing the band gap until a stable configuration is reached. Notably, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibits transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. These findings indicate that femtosecond laser technology offers promising opportunities for precise band gap engineering in various photovoltaic semiconductor devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Incompressible quantum liquid on the four-dimensional sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explorations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four dimensional (4D) QHE has been experimentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</description>
