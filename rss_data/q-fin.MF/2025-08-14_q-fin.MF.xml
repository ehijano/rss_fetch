      <title>Marketron Through the Looking Glass: From Equity Dynamics to Option Pricing in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Marketron model, introduced by [Halperin, Itkin, 2025], describes price formation in inelastic markets as the nonlinear diffusion of a quasiparticle (the marketron) in a multidimensional space comprising the log-price $x$, a memory variable $y$ encoding past money flows, and unobservable return predictors $z$. While the original work calibrated the model to S\&amp;P 500 time series data, this paper extends the framework to option markets - a fundamentally distinct challenge due to market incompleteness stemming from non-tradable state variables. We develop a utility-based pricing approach that constructs a risk-adjusted measure via the dual solution of an optimal investment problem. The resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, though computationally formidable, is solved using a novel methodology enabling efficient calibration even on standard laptop hardware. Having done that, we look at the additional question to answer: whether the Marketron model, calibrated to market option prices, can simultaneously reproduce the statistical properties of the underlying asset's log-returns. We discuss our results in view of the long-standing challenge in quantitative finance of developing an unified framework capable of jointly capturing equity returns, option smile dynamics, and potentially volatility index behavior.</description>

      <title>Intergenerational Equitable Climate Change Mitigation: Negative Effects of Stochastic Interest Rates; Positive Effects of Financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07614v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate mitigation decisions today affect future generations, raising questions of intergenerational equity. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) rely on discounting to evaluate long-term policy costs and benefits. Using the DICE model, we quantify how optimal pathways distribute abatement and damage costs across cohorts. Unconstrained optimization creates intergenerational inequality, with future generations bearing higher costs relative to GDP. Extending the model with stochastic discount rates, we show that discount-rate uncertainty significantly amplifies this inequality. We consider two independent extensions: the financing of abatement costs and the modeling of nonlinear financing costs under large damages. Both extensions can materially improve intergenerational equity by distributing mitigation efforts more evenly. As an illustration, we present a modified DICE model whose optimal pathway limits generational costs to 3 % of GDP, leading to more equitable effort sharing. Our proposed model extensions are model-agnostic, applicable across IAMs, and compatible with alternative intergenerational equity metrics.</description>
