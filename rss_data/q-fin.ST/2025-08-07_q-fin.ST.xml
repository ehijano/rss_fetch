      <title>Multivariate Rough Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by empirical evidence from the joint behavior of realized volatility time series, we propose to model the joint dynamics of log-volatilities using a multivariate fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This model is a multivariate version of the Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility model proposed in Gatheral, Jaisson, and Rosenbaum, Quant. Finance, 2018. It allows for different Hurst exponents in the different marginal components and non trivial interdependencies. We discuss the main features of the model and propose a Generalised Method of Moments estimator that jointly identifies its parameters. We derive the asymptotic theory of the estimator and perform a simulation study that confirms the asymptotic theory in finite sample. We carry out an extensive empirical investigation on all realized volatility time series covering the entire span of about two decades in the Oxford-Man realized library. Our analysis shows that these time series are strongly correlated and can exhibit asymmetries in their empirical cross-covariance function, accurately captured by our model. These asymmetries lead to spillover effects, which we derive analytically within our model and compute based on empirical estimates of model parameters. Moreover, in accordance with the existing literature, we observe behaviors close to non-stationarity and rough trajectories.</description>

      <title>Sparse Asymptotic PCA: Identifying Sparse Latent Factors Across Time Horizon in High-Dimensional Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel sparse latent factor modeling framework using sparse asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA) to analyze the co-movements of high-dimensional panel data over time. Unlike existing methods based on sparse PCA, which assume sparsity in the loading matrices, our approach posits sparsity in the factor processes while allowing non-sparse loadings. This is motivated by the fact that financial returns typically exhibit universal and non-sparse exposure to market factors. Unlike the commonly used $\ell_1$-relaxation in sparse PCA, the proposed sparse APCA employs a truncated power method to estimate the leading sparse factor and a sequential deflation method for multi-factor cases under $\ell_0$-constraints. Furthermore, we develop a data-driven approach to identify the sparsity of risk factors over the time horizon using a novel cross-sectional cross-validation method. We establish the consistency of our estimators under mild conditions as both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $T$ grow. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. Empirically, we apply our method to daily S&amp;P 500 stock returns (2004--2016) and identify nine risk factors influencing the stock market.</description>
