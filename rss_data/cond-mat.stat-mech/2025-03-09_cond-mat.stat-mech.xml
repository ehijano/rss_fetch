      <title>Magnetic Phase Transitions and Mixed Spin in Double Perovskite $Sr_{2}FeMoO_{6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the double perovskite oxide $Sr_{2}$FeMo$O_{6}$ are analyzed using a mixed-spin Ising model with spins $\left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{5}{2}\right) $ in the presence of a random crystal field $\Delta$ and exchange interactions $ J $ on a three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice. The study employs both the Mean-Field Approximation (MFA) based on the Bogoliubov inequality for Gibbs free energy and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's phase transitions and magnetization behavior, with focusing on the role of Fe and Mo sublattices. We establish the ground-state phase diagram, identifying multiple stable magnetic configurations and first-order transitions at low temperatures. Indicate compensation temperature $T_{comp}$. This work provides deeper insight into the thermodynamic, physics statistic and magnetic properties of $Sr_{2}$FeMo$O_{6}$, with implications for future applications in spintronics and magnetic storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Scaling Crossovers in Non-Equilibrium Critical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical universality plays a fundamental role in understanding the scaling properties of critical dynamics, including absorbing phase transitions and physical aging. Although individual universality classes have been extensively studied, the theoretical framework for scaling crossovers between distinct dynamical regimes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a phenomenological approach to describe dynamic scaling crossovers in reaction-diffusion systems, utilizing a Bernoulli differential equation with time-dependent reaction coefficients. Under a new scaling hypothesis for spatial fluctuations, we analytically derive five universal power-law crossover functions. These solutions accurately describe experimental observations of absorbing phase transitions in turbulent liquid crystals and reaction-diffusion crossovers in exciton-exciton recombination, revealing possible mechanisms associated with many-body correlations and two-component dynamics. These findings suggest the existence of universal scaling laws governing the transition between different dynamical states, motivating further studies using field-theoretic approaches and renormalization group analyses.</description>

      <title>Impact of on-site potentials on $q$-breathers in nonlinear chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-site potentials are ubiquitous in physical systems and strongly influence their heat transport and energy localization. These potentials will inevitably affect the dynamical properties of $q$-breathers (QBs), defined as periodic orbits exponentially localized in normal mode space. By integrating on-site terms into the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\beta$ system, this work utilizes numerical simulations and Floquet analysis to systematically explore the influence of on-site potentials on QB stability. For most QBs, except those at the phonon band edges, the instability is primarily governed by parametric resonance, and effectively described by coupled Mathieu equations. This approach provides a theoretical expression for the instability thresholds, which aligns well with numerical results. We demonstrate that the instability thresholds can be controlled through the strength of on-site potentials, and for a strong enough quadratic on-site potential, the QBs are always stable. Furthermore, the instability threshold is highly sensitive to the seed mode, in stark contrast to systems without on-site potentials. In addition, the instability phase diagrams exhibit joint interplay between different terms in the Hamiltonian, such as the quadratic on-site and quartic inter-site interaction terms, in regulating the QB dynamics. These findings offer valuable insights into QB stability and the manipulation of localized excitations in diverse physical systems with on-site potentials.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transitions, quantum criticality, and finite-temperature effects in tunable Dirac materials from functional renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-type models such as the chiral Ising, chiral XY, and chiral Heisenberg models, serve as effective descriptions of two-dimensional Dirac semi-metals undergoing quantum phase transitions into various symmetry-broken ordered states. Their relativistic quantum critical points govern the systems' physical behavior in the vicinity of the transition also at finite temperatures, which is strongly influenced by critical order-parameter and chiral fermion fluctuations. Here, we explore the effect of these fluctuations at zero and finite temperature, both in the Dirac phase and in the Mott phases with spontaneously broken symmetry. To that end, we set up a functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to systematically calculate the quantum phase diagrams and scaling behavior at and near quantum criticality. We explicitly estimate quantum critical exponents, calculate the quasiparticle weight of the chiral Dirac excitations, and determine the extent of the quantum critical fan. Furthermore, we expose a semi-metallic precondensation regime where order-parameter fluctuations destroy order at finite temperature and we show the related manifestation of the Coleman-Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. For the chiral XY model, we also expose signatures of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in a system that includes strong fermion fluctuations. In view of recent experimental developments on correlated phases in highly tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials, our work aims at a more comprehensive theoretical description of relativistic quantum criticality in semi-metals, including non-Dirac-liquid behavior.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Transitions in Noisy Quantum Circuits on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence is ubiquitous, and poses a significant impediment to the observation of quantum phenomena, such as the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition (MIPT). In this work, we study entanglement transitions in quantum circuits on trees, subject to both noise and measurements. We uncover a rich phase diagram that describes the ability of a tree quantum circuit to retain quantum or classical information in the presence of decoherence. By developing a mapping between the dynamics of information on the tree to a classical Markov process -- also defined on the tree -- we obtain exact solutions to the entanglement transitions displayed by the circuit under various noise and measurement strengths. Moreover, we find a host of phenomena, including the MIPT, which are \textit{robust} to decoherence. The analytical tractability facilitated by the method developed in this paper showcases the first example of an exactly solvable noise-robust MIPT, and holds promise for studies on broader, tree-like circuits.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues</title>

Abstract: The development of complex multicellular organisms from a single parent cell is a highly orchestrated process that cells conduct collectively without central guidance, creating intricate dynamic patterns essential for development and regeneration. Despite significant advances in imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of cell collectives and mechanical characterization techniques, the role of physical forces in biological functions remains poorly understood. Physics-based models are crucial in complementing experiments, providing high-resolution spatiotemporal fields in three dimensions. This review focuses on dense, soft multicellular systems, such as tissues, where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the re-organization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers a rich physics-based framework to advance our understanding of biological systems and provides a robust playground for non-equilibrium physics of active matter. We discuss the foundational aspects of the multi-phase-field model and their applications in understanding physics of active matter. We also explore the integration of biological physics with experimental data, covering cell migration, heterogeneous cell populations, and confined systems. Finally, we highlight current trends, the importance of multi-phase-field models in biological and physics research, and future challenges.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibirum physics of density-difference dependent Hamiltonian: Quantum Scarring from Emergent Chiral Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars represent a form of weak ergodicity breaking that highlights the unusual physics of thermalization in quantum systems. Understanding scar formation promises insight into the connection between classical statistical mechanics and the quantum world. The existence of quantum many-body scars calls into question how the macroscopic world can arise from the Schrodinger equation. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of quantum many-body scars in the density-difference-dependent Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian has a particular manifestation of chiral symmetry due to its interaction being neither attractive nor repulsive a prior, but depending on the configuration. As a result of this symmetry and peculiar interaction, we find that this system hosts two different classes of quantum scars; a charge density wave ordered scar and an edge-mode scar. We establish the existence of these scars by examining the entanglement entropy of the system as well as demonstrating robust thermalization breaking time dynamics. For each, we propose simple mechanisms that give rise to these scars which may be applicable to other systems.</description>

      <title>First-principles theory of ionic thermoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in shaping the theories of fundamental forces. For example, general covariance -- the equivalence of all possible coordinate systems of spacetime -- dictates the law of gravity. Here, we extend this concept to nonequilibrium thermodynamics by developing a theory of ionic thermoelectricity (thermoelectricity without electrons) in electronically gapped ionic conductors. Within the Green-Kubo formalism, we show that energy gauge invariance -- the equivalence of all possible ways of distributing energy among atoms -- primarily determines the expressions for ionic thermoelectric coefficients. This symmetry-dictated theory is generally applicable, regardless of specific ion transport mechanisms, and provides a rigorous conceptual and computational framework for describing ionic thermoelectricity from first principles.</description>

      <title>First-passage-time statistics of active Brownian particles: A perturbative approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first-passage-time (FPT) properties of active Brownian particles to reach an absorbing wall in two dimensions. Employing a perturbation approach we obtain exact analytical predictions for the survival and FPT distributions for small P\'eclet numbers, measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion. While randomly oriented active agents reach the wall faster than their passive counterpart, their initial orientation plays a crucial role in the FPT statistics. Using the median as a metric, we quantify this anisotropy and find that it becomes more pronounced at distances where persistent active motion starts to dominate diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic polymers are examples of composite soft materials in which the competition between the large configurational entropy of the soft substrate (polymer) and the magnetic interaction may give rise to rich equilibrium phase diagrams as well as non-standard critical phenomena. Here, we study a self-avoiding walk model decorated by Ising spins of value $0$ and $\pm 1$ that interact according to a Blume-Emery-Griffith-like Hamiltonian. By using mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report the existence of three distinct equilibrium phases: swollen disordered, compact ordered, and compact disordered. Notably, these phases are separated by phase boundaries that meet at multicritical points, whose nature and location are tunable and depend on the strength of the interactions. In our conclusion, we discuss the relevance of the phase diagrams we have obtained to the physics of magnetic polymers and their application to chromatin biophysics.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Designs from Minimally Random Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. Most of this research, however, has been focussed on the case of quantum circuits composed by completely random unitary gates. Here we consider what happens for circuits that, instead, involve a minimal degree of randomness. Specifically, we concentrate on two different settings: (a) brickwork quantum circuits with a single one-qudit random matrix at a boundary; (b) brickwork quantum circuits with fixed interactions but random one-qudit gates everywhere. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth. More precisely, we show that the moments of the distribution produced by our circuits can approximate the ones of the Haar distribution in a depth proportional to the system size. Interestingly we find that in both Cases (a) and (b) the relaxation to the Haar distribution occurs in two steps - this is in contrast with what happens in fully random circuits. Moreover, we show that choosing appropriately the fixed interactions, for example taking the local gate to be a dual-unitary gate with high enough entangling power, minimally random circuits produce a Haar random distribution more rapidly than fully random circuits. In particular, dual-unitary circuits with maximal entangling power - i.e. perfect tensors - appear to provide the optimal quantum state design preparation for any design number.</description>

      <title>Classical origins of Landau-incompatible transitions</title>

Abstract: Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are ubiquitous in physics and often found between `Landau-compatible' phases where residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous `deconfined quantum critical' transitions between Landau-incompatible symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this Letter, we investigate the need for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with anomaly-free symmetries, introduced by Jos\'{e}, Kadanoff, Kirkpatrick and Nelson (Phys. Rev. B 16, 1217). The models are anisotropic deformations of the classical 2d XY model labelled by a positive integer $Q$. For a range of temperatures, even $Q$ models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for $Q \ge 4$. Characteristic features of deconfined quantum criticality, such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects are easily seen in a classical setting. For odd $Q$, and corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial symmetry-breaking phase appear, split by a stable `unnecessary critical' line. We discuss experimental systems that realize these transitions and present anomaly-free quantum models that also exhibit similar phase diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We investigate collective behavior of a system of two-dimensional interacting Brownian particles in the hydrodynamic regime. By means of the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Jenssen-de Dominicis formalism, we built up a generating functional for correlations functions. In the continuum limit, we uncover an exact symmetry under area-preserving diffeomorphism transformations that characterizes a liquid state. This symmetry leads to the conservation of local vorticity. By computing the generating functional within the saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuations approximation, we reveal the emergence of a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry that allows us to describe the dynamics of density fluctuations as a gauge theory. We solve the corresponding equations of motion for short as well as long ranged interactions showing up the presence of multiple dynamical regimes and associated dynamical phase transitions, even for pure repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <title>On the $q$-generalised multinomial/divergence correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic correspondence between the probability mass function of the $q$-deformed multinomial distribution and the $q$-generalised Kullback-Leibler divergence, also known as Tsallis relative entropy, is established. The probability mass function is generalised using the $q$-deformed algebra developed within the framework of nonextensive statistics, leading to the emergence of a family of divergence measures in the asymptotic limit as the system size increases. The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when $q$ is interpreted as an entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients naturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy through a one-parameter generalisation. Some fundamental properties of these extended divergences are also explored.</description>

      <title>Correction-to-scaling exponent for percolation and the Fortuin--Kasteleyn Potts model in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number $n_s$ of clusters (per site) of size $s$, a central quantity in percolation theory, displays at criticality an algebraic scaling behavior of the form $n_s\simeq s^{-\tau}\, A\, (1+B s^{-\Omega})$. For the Fortuin--Kasteleyn representation of the $Q$-state Potts model in two dimensions, the Fisher exponent $\tau$ is known as a function of the real parameter $0\le Q\le4$, and, for bond percolation (the $Q\rightarrow 1$ limit), the correction-to-scaling exponent is derived as $\Omega=72/91$. We theoretically derive the exact formula for the correction-to-scaling exponent $\Omega=8/[(2g+1)(2g+3)]$ as a function of the Coulomb-gas coupling strength $g$, which is related to $Q$ by $Q=2+2\cos(2 \pi g)$. Using an efficient Monte Carlo cluster algorithm, we study the O($n$) loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is in the same universality class as the $Q=n^2$ Potts model, and has significantly suppressed finite-size corrections and critical slowing-down. The predictions of the above formula include the exact value for percolation as a special case and agree well with the numerical estimates of $\Omega$ for both the critical and tricritical branches of the Potts model.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction branching: when you can't tell pure states from mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.</description>

      <title>Dual-unitary shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits termed ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST). To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equivalent depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and more generally, our results are robust to finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of photoelectric devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state thermodynamics of a photodevice which can operate as a solar cell or a photoconductor, depending on the degree of asymmetry of the junction. The thermodynamic efficiency is captured by a single coefficient of performance. Using a minimal model based on a two-level system, we show that when the Coulomb interaction energy matches the transport gap of the junction, the photoconductor displays maximal response, performance, and signal-to-noise ratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell. Nevertheless, we find that the Coulomb interaction is beneficial for the solar cell performance if it lies below the transport gap. Our work sheds important light on design principles for thermodynamically efficient photodevices in the presence of Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity: low-frequency shear modes and intramolecular vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the heat capacity of liquids present fundamental difficulties due to the strong intermolecular particle interactions and large diffusive-like displacements. Based on the experimental evidence that the microscopic dynamics of liquids closely resemble those of solids, a phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics has been developed. Despite its success, the phonon theory of liquids relies on the questionable assumption that low-frequency shear excitations are propagating in nature and follow a Debye density of states. Furthermore, the same framework does not capture the contribution of intramolecular vibrations, which play a significant role in molecular liquids. In this work, we revisit the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity, introducing alternative approaches to model low-frequency shear modes. In particular, we consider the recently proposed idea of treating such modes as pure kinetic and we propose a novel approach based on identifying those low-frequency excitations as overdamped liquid-like modes with linear in frequency density of states. Moreover, we complete the theory by incorporating the effects of intramolecular vibrations. By comparing the theoretical predictions from these different approaches with the available data for the heat capacity of several liquids, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the original model and the newly proposed extensions. Despite all approaches perform well at low-temperatures, our results indicate that modeling low-frequency modes as overdamped liquid-like excitations yields the most accurate agreement with the data in the whole temperature range. Conversely, we demonstrate that treating these excitations as purely gas-like leads to significant inaccuracies, particularly at high temperatures.</description>
