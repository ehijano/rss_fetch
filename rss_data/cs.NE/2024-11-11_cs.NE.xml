      <title>On the Role of Noise in AudioVisual Integration: Evidence from Artificial Neural Networks that Exhibit the McGurk Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans are able to fuse information from both auditory and visual modalities to help with understanding speech. This is frequently demonstrated through an phenomenon known as the McGurk Effect, during which a listener is presented with incongruent auditory and visual speech that fuse together into the percept of an illusory intermediate phoneme. Building on a recent framework that proposes how to address developmental 'why' questions using artificial neural networks, we evaluated a set of recent artificial neural networks trained on audiovisual speech by testing them with audiovisually incongruent words designed to elicit the McGurk effect. We compared networks trained on clean speech to those trained on noisy speech, and discovered that training with noisy speech led to an increase in both visual responses and McGurk responses across all models. Furthermore, we observed that systematically increasing the level of auditory noise during ANN training also increased the amount of audiovisual integration up to a point, but at extreme noise levels, this integration failed to develop. These results suggest that excessive noise exposure during critical periods of audiovisual learning may negatively influence the development of audiovisual speech integration. This work also demonstrates that the McGurk effect reliably emerges untrained from the behaviour of both supervised and unsupervised networks. This supports the notion that artificial neural networks might be useful models for certain aspects of perception and cognition.</description>

      <title>Learning Delays Through Gradients and Structure: Emergence of Spatiotemporal Patterns in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model that incorporates learnable synaptic delays through two approaches: per-synapse delay learning via Dilated Convolutions with Learnable Spacings (DCLS) and a dynamic pruning strategy that also serves as a form of delay learning. In the latter approach, the network dynamically selects and prunes connections, optimizing the delays in sparse connectivity settings. We evaluate both approaches on the Raw Heidelberg Digits keyword spotting benchmark using Backpropagation Through Time with surrogate gradients.
  Our analysis of the spatio-temporal structure of synaptic interactions reveals that, after training, excitation and inhibition group together in space and time. Notably, the dynamic pruning approach, which employs DEEP R for connection removal and RigL for reconnection, not only preserves these spatio-temporal patterns but outperforms per-synapse delay learning in sparse networks.
  Our results demonstrate the potential of combining delay learning with dynamic pruning to develop efficient SNN models for temporal data processing. Moreover, the preservation of spatio-temporal dynamics throughout pruning and rewiring highlights the robustness of these features, providing a solid foundation for future neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm for Multimodal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main challenge of multimodal optimization problems is identifying multiple peaks with high accuracy in multidimensional search spaces with irregular landscapes. This work proposes the Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch (MGP-BBBC) algorithm, which addresses the challenge of multimodal optimization problems by introducing a specialized mechanism for each operator. The algorithm expands the Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm, a state-of-the-art metaheuristic inspired by the universe's evolution. Specifically, MGP-BBBC groups the best individuals of the population into cluster-based centers of mass and then expands them with a progressively lower disturbance to guarantee convergence. During this process, it (i) applies a distance-based filtering to remove unnecessary elites such that the ones on smaller peaks are not lost, (ii) promotes isolated individuals based on their niche count after clustering, and (iii) balances exploration and exploitation during offspring generation to target specific accuracy levels. Experimental results on twenty multimodal benchmark test functions show that MGP-BBBC generally performs better or competitively with respect to other state-of-the-art multimodal optimizers.</description>

      <title>Consciousness is entailed by compositional learning of new causal structures in deep predictive processing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have achieved superhuman performance in specific complex domains. However, learning online from few examples and compositional learning for efficient generalization across domains remain elusive. In humans, such learning includes specific declarative memory formation and is closely associated with consciousness. Predictive processing has been advanced as a principled Bayesian framework for understanding the cortex as implementing deep generative models for both sensory perception and action control. However, predictive processing offers little direct insight into fast compositional learning or of the separation between conscious and unconscious contents. Here, propose that access consciousness arises as a consequence of a particular learning mechanism operating within a predictive processing system. We extend predictive processing by adding online, single-example new structure learning via hierarchical binding of unpredicted inferences. This system learns new causes by quickly connecting together novel combinations of perceptions, which manifests as working memories that can become short- and long-term declarative memories retrievable by associative recall. The contents of such bound representations are unified yet differentiated, can be maintained by selective attention and are globally available. The proposed learning process explains contrast and masking manipulations, postdictive perceptual integration, and other paradigm cases of consciousness research. 'Phenomenal conscious experience' is how the learning system transparently models its own functioning, giving rise to perceptual illusions underlying the meta-problem of consciousness. Our proposal naturally unifies the feature binding, recurrent processing, predictive processing, and global workspace theories of consciousness.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Network as Adaptive Event Stream Slicer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based cameras are attracting significant interest as they provide rich edge information, high dynamic range, and high temporal resolution. Many state-of-the-art event-based algorithms rely on splitting the events into fixed groups, resulting in the omission of crucial temporal information, particularly when dealing with diverse motion scenarios (\eg, high/low speed).In this work, we propose SpikeSlicer, a novel-designed plug-and-play event processing method capable of splitting events stream adaptively.SpikeSlicer utilizes a low-energy spiking neural network (SNN) to trigger event slicing. To guide the SNN to fire spikes at optimal time steps, we propose the Spiking Position-aware Loss (SPA-Loss) to modulate the neuron's state. Additionally, we develop a Feedback-Update training strategy that refines the slicing decisions using feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant performance improvements in event-based object tracking and recognition. Notably, SpikeSlicer provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Spiking Neural Network with Bit Planes and Color Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.</description>
