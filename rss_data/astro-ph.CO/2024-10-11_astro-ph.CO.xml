      <title>Fundamental constants: from measurement to the universe, a window on gravitation and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental constants are a cornerstone of the physical laws. Any constant varying in space and/or time would signal a violation of local position invariance and be associated with a violation of the universality of free fall, and hence of the weak equivalence principle. It will reflect the existence of new degrees of freedom that couple to standard matter. Thus, testing for the stability of fundamental constants is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and for characterizing the domain of validity of General Relativity. Besides, it opens an independent window on dark matter and dark energy. As a consequence, thanks to the active development of experiments and of their accuracy, fundamental constants have become a key player in our search for physics beyond the standard model of and beyond General Relativity.
  This review details the roles of the fundamental constants in the laws of physics and in the construction of the International System of units. Then, the relations between constants, tests of the local position invariance and of the universality of free fall are exposed, as well as the construction of field theories that account for "varying constants". Then, the main experimental and observational constraints are described. It details the basics of each system, its dependence with respect to the primary parameters the variation of which can be constrained from observations, the known systematics effects and the most recent constraints. It also describes how these primary parameters can be related to the fundamental constants and the model-dependencies. Both time and space variation are considered. Given the huge increase of data and constraints, a general scheme to present experimental and observational results and to construct a collaborative data base that will be more efficient for the community and allow for better traceability, is proposed.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain will be highly sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>Psi-GAN: A power-spectrum-informed generative adversarial network for the emulation of large-scale structure maps across cosmologies and redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of the dark matter distribution throughout the Universe are essential in order to analyse data from cosmological surveys. $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, and many cheaper alternatives (such as lognormal random fields) fail to reproduce accurate statistics of the smaller, non-linear scales. In this work, we present Psi-GAN (Power-spectrum-informed Generative Adversarial Network), a machine learning model which takes a two-dimensional lognormal dark matter density field and transforms it into a more realistic field. We construct Psi-GAN so that it is continuously conditional, and can therefore generate realistic realisations of the dark matter density field across a range of cosmologies and redshifts of $z \in [0, 3]$. We train Psi-GAN as a generative adversarial network on $2\,000$ simulation boxes from the Quijote simulations. We use a novel critic architecture that utilises the power spectrum as the basis for discrimination between real and generated samples. Psi-GAN shows agreement with $N$-body simulations over a range of redshifts and cosmologies, consistently outperforming the lognormal approximation on all tests of non-linear structure, such as being able to reproduce both the power spectrum up to wavenumbers of $1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the bispectra of target $N$-body simulations to within ${\sim}5$ per cent. Our improved ability to model non-linear structure should allow tighter constraints on cosmological parameters when used in techniques such as simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>The multi-dimensional halo assembly bias can be preserved when enhancing halo properties with HALOSCOPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over 90% of dark matter haloes in cosmological simulations are unresolved. This hinders the dynamic range of simulations and also produces systematic biases when modelling cosmological tracers. Current methods cannot accurately preserve the multi-dimensional assembly bias found in simulations. Here we aim to enhance the unresolved structural and dynamic properties of haloes. We have developed HALOSCOPE, a machine learning technique using multi-variate conditional probability distribution functions given the input from haloes' local environment. In this work, we use HALOSCOPE to enhance the properties (concentration, spin and two shape parameters) of unresolved dark matter haloes in a low-resolution simulation. The algorithm trained on a high-resolution simulation allows to recover the multi-dimensional halo assembly bias, i.e. the correlations of different combinations of halo properties with the large-scale environment, in addition to the mean and distribution of the halo properties. This is achieved by including the linear halo-by-halo bias and tidal anisotropy in the set of input training parameters. We also study how the halo assembly bias produces galaxy assembly bias and how resolution effects can propagate errors into galaxy clustering. For this purpose, we have generated catalogues of central galaxies using two implementations of the assembly bias in a halo occupation distribution model. The clustering of central model galaxies is improved by a factor of three at $0.009&lt;k (h{\rm Mpc^{-1}})&lt;0.6$, when the unresolved haloes are enhanced with HALOSCOPE. The method developed here can preserve the multi-dimensional halo assembly bias, using the local environment of haloes and can also improve the accuracy of catalogues produced with approximate methods, when many realisations are needed.</description>

      <title>Constraining Reionization with Ly{\alpha} Damping-Wing Absorption in Galaxy Spectra: A Machine Learning Model Based on Reionization Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR observations by JWST have begun providing rest-frame UV continuum measurements of galaxies at $z\gtrsim7$, revealing signatures of Ly$\alpha$ damping-wing (DW) absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM). We develop a methodology to constrain the global ionization fraction of the IGM $(Q_{\rm HII})$ using low-resolution spectra, employing the random forest classification (RFC) method. We construct mock spectra using the simulated galaxies and the IGM from the Cosmic Dawn II simulation and train RFC models to estimate $Q_{\rm HII}$ at the redshift of the source and to detect the presence of a damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber (DLA). We find that individual galaxy spectra with spectral bins between 1220 and 1270 {\AA} and with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 can place tight constraints on $Q_{\rm HII}$, provided the UV continuum is accurately modeled. This method is particularly effective for the early phase of reionization ($Q_{\rm HII}&lt;50\%$), when the IGM opacity is high in the DW. As a demonstration, we apply our model to existing NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra, placing upper bounds of $Q_{\rm HII}=59.6\%$, $5.6\%$, and $18.5\%$ at $z=7.7,~9.4,$ and $10.6$, respectively, with $68\%$ confidence, though several modeling uncertainties remain to be discussed. These constraints favor late-starting reionization models, where $\gtrsim 80\%$ of the IGM is ionized after $z=8$. We conclude that high SNR observations of carefully selected targets around $z\sim7-9$ can effectively constrain reionization models.</description>

      <title>Global signal in the redshifted hydrogen 21-cm line from Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn: dependences on dark matter nature and first light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the global signal in the redshifted hyperfine structure line 21 cm of hydrogen atoms formed during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. The evolution of the brightness temperature in this line was computed to study its dependence on the physical conditions in the intergalactic medium. We show that the profile of this line crucially depends on the temperature and ionization of baryonic matter as well as the spectral energy distribution of radiation from the first sources. The cosmological models with the self-annihilating and decaying dark matter with allowable parameters by current observational data, as well as the model of the first light which is consistent with the observational data on reionization were considered. The results show that the Dark Ages part of profile is very sensitive to the parameters of self-annihilating and decaying dark matter particles, while the Cosmic Dawn part of profile is very sensitive also to the spectral energy distribution of radiation from the first sources. It was concluded that only compatible observations of the redshifted 21 cm line in the decameter and meter wavelength range, formed during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn, will make it possible to constrain the parameters of dark matter models and astrophysical models of the first sources based on the radiotomography of the young Universe.</description>

      <title>Circumventing Cosmic Variance via Remote Quadrupole Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of important cosmological questions can be addressed only by probing perturbation modes on the largest accessible scales. One promising probe of these modes is the Kamionkowski-Loeb effect, i.e., the polarization induced in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by Thomson scattering in galaxy clusters, which is proportional to the CMB quadrupole measured at the cluster's location and look-back time. We develop a Fisher formalism for assessing the amount of new information that can be obtained from a future remote quadrupole survey. To demonstrate the constraining power of such a survey, we apply our formalism to a model that suppresses the primordial power spectrum on large scales but is poorly constrained with existing CMB data. We find that the constraints can be improved by $4\sigma$ for a survey that measures around 100 clusters over $20\%$ of the sky with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.0. This constraint improves to over $7\sigma$ for a low-noise survey with dense and full sky coverage. Our formalism, which is based in real space rather than harmonic space, can be used to explore a wide range of survey designs and our results paint an optimistic picture for the utility of remote quadrupole measurements to probe physics on the largest observable scales in the Universe.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{21cmLSTM}$: A Fast Memory-based Emulator of the Global 21 cm Signal with Unprecedented Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network (NN) emulators of the global 21 cm signal need emulation error much less than the observational noise in order to be used to perform unbiased Bayesian parameter inference. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ -- a long short-term memory (LSTM) NN emulator of the global 21 cm signal that leverages the intrinsic correlation between frequency channels to achieve exceptional accuracy compared to previous emulators, which are all feedforward, fully connected NNs. LSTM NNs are a type of recurrent NN designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. When trained and tested on the same simulated set of global 21 cm signals as the best previous emulators, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ has average relative rms error of 0.22% -- equivalently 0.39 mK -- and comparably fast evaluation time. We perform seven-dimensional Bayesian parameter estimation analyses using $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ to fit global 21 cm signal mock data with different adopted observational noise levels, $\sigma_{21}$. The posterior $1\sigma$ rms error is $\approx3\times$ less than $\sigma_{21}$ for each fit and consistently decreases for tighter noise levels, showing that $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ can sufficiently exploit even very optimistic measurements of the global 21 cm signal. We made the emulator, code, and data sets publicly available so that $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ can be independently tested and used to retrain and constrain other 21 cm models.</description>

      <title>Unified Origin of Curvature Perturbation and Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework that describes both the curvaton mechanism for generating primordial density fluctuations and the Affleck-Dine (AD) field for baryogenesis. By introducing a complex scalar field (AD field) carrying a baryon/lepton number and its potential consisting of quadratic and quartic terms with a small baryon/lepton-number-violating mass term, we investigate the evolution of the scalar field during the radiation-dominated era following inflation. We set the initial conditions such that the quartic term dominates the scalar potential, and the angular component of the AD field is non-zero. We focus on a scenario where the AD field decays early, ensuring that its energy density never dominates over that of radiation. We show that the radial component of the AD field can be identified with the curvaton to solely produce the Planck normalized scalar power spectrum while the evolution of the angular component is crucial for generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. Additionally, we find that the amplitude of scalar bispectrum $f_{NL}$ is positive, with an amplitude of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, which is consistent with the current Planck data and testable in future observations such as CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, LSS, and 21-cm experiments. In our estimation of the scalar power spectrum and bispectrum, we develop a novel analytical scheme for computing scalar fluctuations based on the $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to deal with the evolution of curvaton with polynomial potential more accurately in comparison to the existing analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Does Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Waves satisfy the Pulsar Timing Arrays observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results also have difference with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses, shows the reason of different GW power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Constraints on compact objects from the Dark Energy Survey five-year supernova sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) allows information to be obtained about the distribution of matter on small scales. In this paper, we derive limits on the fraction $\alpha$ of the total matter density in compact objects (which comprise stars, stellar remnants, small stellar groupings and primordial black holes) of mass $M &gt; 0.03 M_{\odot}$ over cosmological distances. Using 1,532 SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 sample (DES-SN5YR) combined with a Bayesian prior for the absolute magnitude $M$, we obtain $\alpha &lt; 0.12$ at the 95\% confidence level after marginalisation over cosmological parameters, lensing due to large-scale structure, and intrinsic non-Gaussianity. Similar results are obtained using priors from the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations and galaxy weak lensing, indicating our results do not depend on the background cosmology. We argue our constraints are likely to be conservative (in the sense of the values we quote being higher than the truth), but discuss scenarios in which they could be weakened by systematics of the order of $\Delta \alpha \sim 0.04$</description>

      <title>High-redshift LBG selection from broadband and wide photometric surveys using a Random Forest algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility of selecting high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBG) using current and future broadband wide photometric surveys, such as UNIONS or the Vera C. Rubin LSST, using a Random Forest algorithm. This work is conducted in the context of future large-scale structure spectroscopic surveys like DESI-II, the next phase of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which will start around 2029. We use deep imaging data from HSC and CLAUDS on the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. To predict the selection performance of LBGs with image quality similar to UNIONS, we degrade the $u, g, r, i$ and $z$ bands to UNIONS depth. The Random Forest algorithm is trained with the $u,g,r,i$ and $z$ bands to classify LBGs in the $2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ range. We find that fixing a target density budget of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$, the Random Forest approach gives a density of $z&gt;2$ targets of $873$ deg$^{-2}$, and a density of $493$ deg$^{-2}$ of confirmed LBGs after spectroscopic confirmation with DESI. This UNIONS-like selection was tested in a dedicated spectroscopic observation campaign of 1,000 targets with DESI on the COSMOS field, providing a safe spectroscopic sample with a mean redshift of 3. This sample is used to derive forecasts for DESI-II, assuming a sky coverage of 5,000 deg$^2$. We predict uncertainties on Alcock-Paczynski parameters $\alpha_\perp$ and $\alpha_{\parallel}$ to be 0.7$\%$ and 1$\%$ for $2.6&lt;z&lt;3.2$, resulting in a 2$\%$ measurement of the dark energy fraction. Additionally, we estimate the uncertainty in local non-Gaussianity and predict $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}\approx 7$, which is comparable to the current best precision achieved by Planck.</description>

      <title>DESI forecast for Dark Matter-Neutrino interactions using EFTofLSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) to non-standard models of dark matter with suppressed small-scale structure imprinted by early-time physics, here exemplified by interacting dark matter (IDM) coupled to standard model neutrinos, and cross-check that the EFTofLSS has no trouble replicating the real-space halo-halo power spectrum from N-body simulations. We perform forecasts for a DESI ELG-like experiment using the redshift-space power spectrum and find that, under very conservative priors on these parameters, the EFTofLSS is not expected to yield strong constraints on dark matter interactions. However, with a better understanding of the evolution of counterterms and stochastic terms with redshift, realistic IDM models could in principle be detected using the full-shape power spectrum analysis of such a spectroscopic galaxy survey.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04340v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we propose a novel method for space-based OLC detectors that can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by utilizing the cross-correlation between two of them. This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Our results indicate that the cross-correlation technique can improve the sensitivity by approximately an order of magnitude compared to a single OLC detector configuration, and even would surpass current detection systems such as LISA in the full-band detection capability of SGWB.</description>

      <title>The initial mass function of stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important functions in astrophysics because it is key to reconstructing the cosmological matter cycle, understanding the formation of super-massive black holes, and deciphering the light from high-redshift observations. The IMF's dependency on the physical conditions of the gas and its connection to the galaxy-wide IMF connects the molecular clumps to the cosmological scale. The extraction of the IMF from observational data requires a thorough understanding of stellar evolution, the time-dependent stellar multiplicity, the stellar-dynamical evolution of dense stellar populations, and the structures, star formation histories, and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies. The IMF in galaxies, referred to as the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF), and the IMF in individual star-forming regions (the stellar IMF) need not be the same, although the former must be related to the latter. Observational surveys inform on whether star-forming regions provide evidence for the stellar IMF being a probability density distribution function. They may also indicate star formation to optimally follow an IMF shaped by the physical conditions of the star-forming gas. Both theoretical and observational evidence suggest a relationship between the initial mass function of brown dwarfs and that of stars. Late-type stars may arise from feedback-regulated fragmentation of molecular cloud filaments, which build up embedded clusters. In contrast, early-type stars form under more violent accretion and feedback-regulated conditions near the centers of these clusters. The integration over all star-forming molecular cloud clumps and their stellar IMFs in a galaxy via the IGIMF theory yields its gwIMF which sensitively depends on the physical properties of the molecular cloud clumps and the range of their masses that depends on the SFR of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>On the impact of AGN feedback modes onto the turbulent properties of the multiphase ICM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a crucial role in regulating the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM). Studying the turbulent patterns of the hot and warm ionized phases may allow us to determine how these phases are involved in the AGN cycle and the amount of turbulent pressure generated by the latter. In this work, we use new simulations to study the turbulent motions created by different types of AGN feedback in a cool core cluster and predict the observable signatures with the latest X-ray telescopes (e.g. XRISM). We run several hydrodynamic simulations with ENZO, simulating the self-regulated cycles of AGN feedback, starting from a static ICM in a cluster that represents the Perseus cluster. We study in detail different feedback modes: from pure kinetic precessing jets up to almost pure thermal feedback. Our analysis reveals that the gas velocity dispersion in the center of the cluster correlates in time with the peaks of the AGN activity and that more than 50% of the time, different feedback modalities produce the velocity dispersion observed in the Perseus cluster while leading to distinct geometrical distributions and velocity dispersion profiles. Moreover, we do not find a significant kinematic coupling between the hot and the cold phase kinematics. We find a correlation between the AGN activity and the steepening of the velocity function structure (VSF) and that the projected 2D VSF slopes are never trivially correlated with the 3D VSF ones. This line of research will allow us to use incoming detections of gas turbulent motions detectable by XRISM (or future instruments) to better constrain the duty cycle, energetics and energy dissipation modalities of AGN feedback in massive clusters of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Long-Ranged Interactions Between Dark Matter and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter's existence is known thanks to its gravitational interaction with Standard Model particles, but it remains unknown whether this is the only force present between them. While many searches for such new interactions with dark matter focus on short-range, contact-like interactions, it is also possible that there exist weak, long-ranged forces between dark matter and the Standard Model. In this work, we present two types of constraints on such new interactions. First, we consider constraints arising from the fact that such a force would also induce long range interactions between Standard Model particles themselves, as well as between dark matter particles themselves. Combining the constraints on these individual forces generally sets the strongest constraints available on new Standard Model-dark matter interactions. Second, we consider the possibility of constraining new long-ranged interactions between dark matter and the Standard Model using the effects of dynamical friction in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, especially Segue I. Such new interactions would accelerate the transfer of kinetic energy from stars to their surrounding dark matter, slowly reducing their orbits; the present-day stellar half-light radius of Segue I therefore allows us to exclude new forces which would have reduced stars' orbital radii below this scale by now.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Quadrupolar Nature of Gravitational Wave Background through Space-based Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consists of an incoherent collection of waves from both astrophysical and cosmological sources. To distinguish the SGWB from noise, it is essential to verify its quadrupolar nature, exemplified by the cross-correlations among pairs of pulsars within a pulsar timing array, commonly referred to as the Hellings-Downs curve. We extend the concept of quadrupolar correlations to pairs of general gravitational wave detectors, classified by their antenna responses. This study involves space-based missions such as the laser interferometers LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, along with atom interferometers like AEDGE/MAGIS. We calculate modulations in their correlations due to orbital motions and relative orientations, which are characteristic markers for identifying the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB. Our findings identify optimal configurations for these missions, offer forecasts for the time needed to identify the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB, and are applicable to both space-space and space-terrestrial correlations.</description>

      <title>BBN Constraint on Heavy Neutrino Production and Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint on heavy neutrino that is a mixture of gauge singlet fermion and active neutrinos in the Standard Model. We work in the minimal model with only two parameters, the heavy neutrino mass $m_4$ and the mixing parameter $|U_{a4}|^2$, where $a=e$, $\mu$, or $\tau$ stands for the active neutrino flavor. We show that both the early universe production mechanism and decay products of the heavy neutrino are determined by $m_4$ and $|U_{a4}|^2$, with little room for further assumptions. This predictivity allows us to present a portrait of the entire BBN excluded parameter space. Our analysis includes various effects including temporary matter domination, energy injections in the form of pions, photons and light neutrinos. The BBN constraint is complementary to terrestrial search for heavy neutrinos (heavy neutral leptons) behind the origin of neutrino masses and portal to the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from the Hagedorn Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We illustrate the main points behind the computation of the gravitational wave spectrum originated from a phase in the early universe where the energy density is dominated by highly excited fundamental string degrees of freedom - a Hagedorn phase. This phase is described using the Boltzmann equation approach to string thermodynamics, which we illustrate via a toy model which permits analytic computations for the evolution of perturbations. This window into the out-of-equilibrium regime allows us to compute equilibration rates and conclude that, in realistic scenarios, long, open strings dominate the ensemble, source gravitational waves and provide a succesful reheating. Furthermore, we compare the results against the Standard Model prediction for a gravitational wave background of thermal origin and conclude that the string prediction is significantly larger. This is one of the few cases in which a signal of stringy origin dominates over the field theory analogue. This work is based on arXiv:2310.11494 and arXiv:2408.13803 and is a contribution to the Proceedings of the 29th symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS 2024).</description>

      <title>Striking a Chord with Spectral Sirens: multiple features in the compact binary population correlate with $H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral siren measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) rely on correlations between observed detector-frame masses and luminosity distances. Features in the source-frame mass distribution can induce these correlations. It is crucial, then, to understand (i) which features in the source-frame mass distribution are robust against model (re)parametrization, (ii) which features carry the most information about $H_0$, and (iii) whether distinct features independently correlate with cosmological parameters. We study these questions using real gravitational-wave observations from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' third observing run. Although constraints on $H_0$ are weak, we find that current data reveals several prominent features in the mass distribution, including peaks in the binary black hole source-frame mass distribution near $\sim$ 9 $\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and $\sim$ 32$\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and a roll-off at masses above $\sim$ 46$\rm{M}_{\odot}$. For the first time using real data, we show that all of these features carry cosmological information and that the peak near $\sim$ 32$\rm{M}_{\odot}$ consistently correlates with $H_0$ most strongly. Introducing model-independent summary statistics, we show that these statistics independently correlate with $H_0$, exactly what is required to limit systematics within future spectral siren measurements from the (expected) astrophysical evolution of the mass distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</description>

      <title>Formation of defects associated with both spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss formation of cosmic strings associated with a spontaneously broken approximate $U(1)$ symmetry by performing classical field-theoretical simulations. An original $U(1)$ symmetry is explicitly broken down to its subgroup $Z_N$ even before spontaneous breaking takes place. We estimate the ratio of explicit breaking to that of spontaneous breaking for which topological defects for $N=1$ and $N=2$ are formed. For $N=1$, a cosmic string attached to a single domain wall can be formed when the amount of the explicit breaking is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the spontaneous breaking. For $N=2$, no matter how large the explicit breaking is, domain walls are inevitably formed as long as the temperature of the Universe is high enough to restore $Z_2$ symmetry. In that case, cosmic strings are also inevitably formed as long as the amount of the explicit breaking is smaller than that of the spontaneous breaking.</description>

      <title>The light burden of memory: constraining primordial black holes with high-energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies point out that quantum effects, referred to as "memory burden", may slow down the evaporation of black holes. As a result, a population of light primordial black holes could potentially survive to the present day, thus contributing to the energy density of dark matter. In this work, we focus on light primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{9}~{\rm g}$ that, due to the memory burden effect, are currently evaporating, emitting high-energy particles, among which neutrinos, in the local Universe. Analyzing the latest IceCube data, we place novel constraints on the combined parameter space of primordial black holes and the memory burden effect. We also study the projected reach of future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND. We find that the neutrino observations are crucial to probe scenarios with highly-suppressed evaporation and light masses for primordial black holes.</description>

A brief review of phenomenological consequences in the context of AS regarding cosmology with emphasis on dark energy is given. Furthermore, recent studies that suggest a natural explanation of the recent cosmic acceleration and its coincidence using large-scale structure and AS framework will be analyzed.

      <title>Multi-messenger signatures of a deformed magnetar in gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a newly formed magnetized neutron-star (NS) as a power source of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the light of both gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiations. The compressible and incompressible fluids are employed in order to model the secular evolution of Maclaurian spheroids. It is shown that the GW and EM light curves evolve as a function of eccentricity and rotational frequency with time. We find that the light curve characteristics crucially depend on NS parameters such as magnitude and structure of magnetic field, ellipticity and the equation of state (EOS) of the fluid. The presence of X-ray flares, whose origins are not yet well understood, can be captured in our model regarding some specific nuclear EOSs. Our model allowing us to explain flares that occur within the wide range of $ 10$ to $10^4$ seconds and the peak luminosity in the order of $10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\rm \text{erg}/s$ by using a reasonable set of parameters such as magnetic field strength around $10^{14}-10^{16}$ Gauss, the quadrupole to dipole ratio of magnetic field up to 500. By applying our model to a sample of GRB X-ray flares observed by Swift/XRT, we try to constraint the crucial parameters of a deformed magnetar via MCMC fitting method. Our analysis shows that ongoing and upcoming joint multi-messenger detections can be used to understand the nature of GRB's central engine and its evolution at the early times of the burst formation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Simulations of Axion String-Wall Networks: Probing Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves for Discovery</title>

Abstract: We simultaneously study gravitational waves (GWs) and free axions emitted from axionic string-wall networks in the early universe using advanced 3D lattice simulations. Our simulations start before the Peccei-Quinn phase transition and end with the destruction of string-wall networks below the QCD scale. The axion dark matter (DM) relic abundance radiated from string-wall networks are updated and refined for the scenarios of $N_{\rm DW}&gt;1$. In this scenario, we observe that the GW spectrum is almost independent of the bias term and $N_{\rm DW}$, and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\propto f^{1.29}(f^{-0.43})$ in the IR and middle-frequency regions. After considering the constraints from DM relic abundance, we found that the QCD axion model predicts undetectable GW emissions, and the axion-like particles model allows for a detectable GW signal in the nano-Hertz to the milli-Hertz frequency range corresponding to axion masses range from KeV to TeV. For $N_{\rm DW}=1$, the GW energy density appears undetectable for QCD axions and axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW) II: Properties of local galaxy clusters</title>

Abstract: This is the second paper in a series presenting the results from a 500 $h^{-1}$Mpc large constrained hydro-dynamical simulation of the local Universe (SLOW). The initial conditions are based on peculiar velocities derived from the CosmicFlows-2 catalogue. The inclusion of galaxy formation treatment, allows to directly predict observable properties of the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) within galaxy clusters. Comparing the properties of observed galaxy clusters within the local Universe with the properties of their simulated counterparts, enables us to assess the effectiveness of the initial condition constraints in accurately replicating the non-linear properties of the largest, collapsed objects within the simulation. Based on the combination of several, publicly available surveys, we identified 45 local Universe galaxy clusters in SLOW, including the 13 most massive from the Planck SZ catalog and 70% of those with $M_{500} &gt; 2\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. We then derived the probability of the cross identification based on mass, X-ray luminosity, temperature and Compton-y by comparing it to a random selection. In relation to previous constrained simulations of the local volume, we found in SLOW a much larger amount of replicated galaxy clusters, where their simulation based mass prediction falls within the uncertainties of the observational mass estimates. Comparing the median observed and simulated masses of our cross identified sample allows to independently deduce a hydrostatic mass bias of $(1-b)\approx0.87$. The SLOW constrained simulation of the local Universe faithfully reproduces numerous fundamental characteristics of the galaxy clusters within our local neighbourhood, opening a new avenue for studying the formation and evolution of a large set of individual galaxy clusters as well as testing our understanding of physical processes governing the ICM.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-large scales close to the cosmological horizon will be probed by the upcoming observational campaigns. They hold the promise to constrain single-field inflation as well as general relativity, but in order to include them in the forthcoming analyses, their modelling has to be robust. In particular, general relativistic effects may be mistaken for primordial signals, and no consensus has emerged either from analytical modelling nor from the numerical route, obstructed by the large dynamical range to be simulated. In this work, we present a numerical technique to overcome the latter limitation: we compute the general relativistic displacement field with the N-body relativistic code gevolution and combine it with the accurate Newtonian simulation Gadget-4. This combination leads to an effective simulation reproducing the desired behaviour at the level of the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. We then measure, for the first time in a simulation, the relativistic scale-dependent bias in Poisson gauge; at redshift $z=0$, we find $b_1^{\mathrm{GR}}=-5.7 \pm 1.7$. Our results at the field level are only valid in the Poisson gauge and need to be complemented with a relativistic ray tracing algorithm to compute the number count observable.</description>

      <title>From infinite to infinitesimal: Using the Universe as a dataset to probe Casimir corrections to the vacuum energy from fields inhabiting the dark dimension</title>

Abstract: Promptly after high-resolution experiments harbinger the field of precision cosmology low- and high-redshift observations abruptly gave rise to a tension in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate of the Universe ($H_0$) and the clustering of matter ($S_8$). The statistically significant discrepancies between the locally measured values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ and the ones inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background assuming the canonical $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model have become a new cornerstone of theoretical physics. $\Lambda_s$CDM is one of the many beyond Standard Model setups that have been proposed to simultaneously resolve the cosmological tensions. This setup relies on an empirical conjecture, which postulates that $\Lambda$ switched sign (from negative to positive) at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. We reexamine a stringy model that can describe the transition in the vacuum energy hypothesized in $\Lambda_s$CDM. The model makes use of the Casimir forces driven by fields inhabiting the incredible bulk of the dark dimension scenario. Unlike the $\Lambda_s$CDM setup the model deviates from $\Lambda$CDM in the early universe due to the existence of relativistic neutrino-like species. Using the Boltzmann solver CLASS in combination with MontePython we confront predictions of the stringy model to experimental data (from the Planck mission, Pantheon+ supernova type Ia, BAO, and KiDS-1000). We show that the string-inspired model provides a satisfactory fit to the data and can resolve the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Comparing sharp and smooth transitions of the second slow-roll parameter in single-field inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In single-field inflation, violation of the slow-roll approximation can lead to growth of curvature perturbation outside the horizon. This violation is characterized by a period with a large negative value of the second slow-roll parameter. At an early time, inflation must satisfy the slow-roll approximation, so the large-scale curvature perturbation can explain the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. At intermediate time, it is viable to have a theory that violates the slow-roll approximation, which implies amplification of the curvature perturbation on small scales. Specifically, we consider ultraslow-roll inflation as the intermediate period. At late time, inflation should go back to the slow roll period so that it can end. This means that there are two transitions of the second slow-roll parameter. In this paper, we compare two different possibilities for the second transition: sharp and smooth transitions. Focusing on effects generated by the relevant cubic self-interaction of the curvature perturbation, we find that the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum due to the change of the second slow-roll parameter vanish if and only if the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for perturbation satisfies a specific condition called Wands duality. We also find in the case of sharp transition that, even though this duality is satisfied in the ultraslow-roll and slow-roll phases, it is severely violated at the transition so that the resultant one-loop correction is extremely large inversely proportional to the duration of the transition.</description>

      <title>Discreteness Effects in the Post-Reconstruction Galaxy Power Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly recognized the value of analyzing the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum for investigations into redshift space distortion (RSD) effects. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical model for the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, designed for RSD analyses. In particular, we emphasize the importance of accounting for discrete effects arising from the reconstruction displacement vector, which have been overlooked. We specifically calculate these discrete effects, i.e., shot noise terms, within the framework of standard perturbation theory at the 1-loop level. In addition, we adopt a formulation that accounts for infrared (IR) effects to accurately model the non-linear damping of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal. Our model comprehensively integrates key physical phenomena relevant to the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, such as gravitational non-linearities, RSD effects, bias effects, reconstruction effects, reconstruction-specific shot-noise effects, and the non-linear damping of the reconstructed BAO signal, thereby making it applicable to post-reconstruction RSD analyses.</description>

      <title>Density Fluctuations in the Intracluster Medium: An Attempt to Constrain Viscosity with Cosmological Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of viscosity in the Intracluster Medium (ICM) is still an open question in astrophysics. To address this problem, we have run a set of cosmological simulations of three galaxy clusters with a mass larger than $M_{\mathrm{Vir}} &gt; 10^{15} $M$_{\odot}$ at $z=0$ using the SPMHD-code OpenGadget3. We aim to quantify the influence of viscosity and constrain its value in the ICM. Our results show significant morphological differences at small scales, temperature variations, and density fluctuations induced by viscosity. We observe a suppression of instabilities at small scales, resulting in a more filamentary structure and a larger amount of small structures due to the lack of mixing with the medium. The conversion of kinetic to internal energy leads to an increase of the virial temperature of the cluster of $\sim$5% - 10%, while the denser regions remain cold. The amplitude of density and velocity fluctuations are found to increase with viscosity. However, comparison with observational data indicates that the simulations, regardless of the viscosity, match the observed slope of the amplitude of density fluctuations, challenging the direct constraint of viscosity solely through density fluctuations. Furthermore, the ratio of density to velocity fluctuations remains close to 1 regardless of the amount of viscosity, in agreement with the theoretical expectations. Our results show for the first time in a cosmological simulation of a galaxy cluster the effect of viscosity in the ICM, a study that is currently missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Efficient estimation of rotation-induced bias to reconstructed CMB lensing power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing power spectrum is a powerful probe of the late-time universe, encoding valuable information about cosmological parameters such as the sum of neutrino masses and dark energy equation of state. However, the presence of anisotropic cosmic birefringence can bias the reconstructed CMB lensing power spectrum using CMB polarization maps, particularly at small scales, and affect the constraints on these parameters. Upcoming experiments, which will be dominated by the polarization lensing signal, are especially susceptible to this bias. We identify the dominant contribution to this bias as an $N_L^{(1)}$-like noise, caused by anisotropic rotation instead of lensing. We show that, for an CMB-S4-like experiment, a scale-invariant anisotropic rotation field with a standard deviation of 0.05 degrees can suppress the small-scale lensing power spectrum ($L\gtrsim 2000$) at a comparable level to the effect of massive neutrino with $\sum_i m_{\nu_{i}}=50~\rm{meV}$, making rotation field an important source of degeneracy in neutrino mass measurement for future CMB experiments. We provide an analytic expression and a simulation-based estimator for this $N_L^{(1)}$-like noise, which allows for efficient forecasting and mitigation of the bias in future experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of a non-scale-invariant rotation power spectrum on the reconstructed lensing power spectrum and find that an excess of power in the small-scale rotation power spectrum leads to a larger bias. Our work provides an effective numeric framework to accurately model and account for the bias caused by anisotropic rotation in future CMB lensing measurements.</description>

      <title>Classification of radio backgrounds at cosmic dawn and 21-cm signal confirmation using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several ongoing and upcoming radio telescopes aim to detect either the global 21-cm signal or the 21-cm power spectrum. The extragalactic radio background, as detected by ARCADE-2 and LWA-1, suggests a strong radio background from cosmic dawn, which can significantly alter the cosmological 21-cm signal, enhancing both the global signal amplitude and the 21-cm power spectrum. In this paper, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN) to check if there is a radio excess over the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in mock data, and if present, we classify its type into one of two categories, a background from high-redshift radio galaxies or a uniform exotic background from the early Universe. Based on clean data (without observational noise), the ANN can predict the background radiation type with $96\%$ accuracy for the power spectrum and $90\%$ for the global signal. Although observational noise reduces the accuracy, the results remain quite useful. We also apply ANNs to map the relation between the 21-cm power spectrum and the global signal. By reconstructing the global signal using the 21-cm power spectrum, an ANN can estimate the global signal range consistent with an observed power spectrum from SKA-like experiments. Conversely, we show that an ANN can reconstruct the 21-cm power spectrum over a wide range of redshifts and wavenumbers given the global signal over the same redshifts. Such trained networks can potentially serve as a valuable tool for cross-confirmation of the 21-cm signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a hypothesis proposed in previous research relating neutron star (NS) mass and its dark matter (DM) accumulation. As DM accumulates, NS mass decreases, predicting lower NS masses toward the Galactic center. Due to limited NSs data near the galactic center, we examine NSs located within DM clumps. Using the CLUMPY code simulations, we determine the DM clumps distribution, with masses from 10 to $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$ and scales from $10^{-3}$ to 10 kpc. These clumps' DM exhibit a peak at the center, tapering toward the outskirts, resembling our Galaxy's DM distribution.
  We analyse these DM clumps' NS mass variations, considering diverse DM particle masses and galaxy types. We find relatively stable NS mass within 0.01 to 5 kpc from the clump center. This stability supports the initial hypothesis, particularly for NSs located beyond 0.01 kpc from the clump center, where NS mass reaches a plateau around 0.1 kpc. Nevertheless, NS mass near the clump's periphery reveals spatial dependence: NS position within DM clumps influences its mass in Milky Way-type galaxies. Moreover, this dependence varies with the DM model considered.
  In summary, our study investigates the proposed link between NS mass and DM accumulation by examining NSs within DM clumps. While NS mass remains stable at certain distances from the clump center, spatial dependencies arise near the clump's outer regions, contingent on the specific DM model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) constitutes the predominant portion of matter in our universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly-interacting massive particles, which may clump into steep concentrations around the central black holes of galaxies. However, DM profiles of the resulting dense spikes remain uncertain. Here we employ the relativistic dynamics in Schwarzschild geometry and first evaluate the velocity distributions of DM within such spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we identify universal features in DM profiles and fit them with Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we illustrate with the impact of dynamical friction on gravitational waves generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within DM spikes, taking into account the velocity distribution of DM in the relativistic regime. Our findings demonstrate the phase shifts in the time-domain waveform, potentially providing useful insights for probing DM in galactic centers by gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing Stochastic Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational-Wave Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight particles are theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates. In the vicinity of the solar system, these ultralight particles can be described as a superposition of plane waves, resulting in a stochastic field with sizable amplitude fluctuations on scales determined by the velocity dispersion of dark matter. In this work, we systematically investigate the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave interferometers to the stochastic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field within the frequentist framework. We derive the projected sensitivity of a single detector using the time-delay interferometry. Our results show that space-based gravitational-wave interferometers have the potential to probe unconstrained regions in parameter space and improve the current limit on coupling strengths. Furthermore, we explore the sensitivity of a detector network and investigate the optimal configuration for ULDM detection. We introduce the overlap reduction function for ULDM, which quantifies the degree of correlation between the signals observed by different detectors. We find that the configuration, where the signals observed by two detectors are uncorrelated, is the optimal choice for ULDM detection due to a smaller chance of missing signal. This contrasts with the detection of stochastic gravitational-wave background, where the correlated configuration is preferred. Our results may provide useful insights for potential joint observations involving space-based gravitational-wave detectors like LISA and Taiji, as well as other ULDM detection networks operating in the coherence limit.</description>

Abstract: The application of Horndeski theory/ Galileons for late time cosmology is heavily constrained by the strict coincidence in the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves. These constraints presuppose that the minimally coupled photon is not modified, not even at the scales where General Relativity (GR) may need modification. We find that the 4D Galileon obtained from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of its higher dimensional version is a natural simultaneous modification of GR and electromagnetism with automatically "luminal" gravitational waves. This property follows without any fine tuning of Galileon potentials for a larger class of theories than previously thought. In particular, the $G_4$ potential is not constrained by the speed test and $G_5$ may also be present. In other words, some Galileon models that have been ruled out since the event GW170817 are, in fact, not necessarily constrained if they arise in 4D from compactifications of their higher dimensional Galileon counterparts. Besides their compelling luminality, the resulting vector Galileons are naturally $U(1)$ gauge invariant. We also argue that the Vainshtein screening that allows to recover GR predictions for solar system tests is also at work for electrodynamics in the dense region of laboratory tests.</description>

      <title>Higher-order corrections to phase-transition parameters in dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of phase transitions (PT) in quantum field theories at finite temperature is most accurately described within the framework of dimensional reduction. In this framework, thermodynamic quantities are computed within the 3-dimensional effective field theory (EFT) that results from integrating out the high-temperature Matsubara modes. However, strong-enough PTs, observable in gravitational wave (GW) detectors, occur often nearby the limit of validity of the EFT, where effective operators can no longer be neglected. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of these interactions on the determination of PT parameters. We find that they allow for strong PTs in a wider region of parameter space, and that both the peak frequency and the amplitude of the resulting GW power spectrum can change by more than one order of magnitude when they are included. As a byproduct of this work, we derive equations for computing the bounce solution in the presence of higher-derivative terms, consistently with the EFT power counting.</description>

      <title>Source anisotropies and pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>$SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmological Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological theory where the kinetic term and potential have $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. Potentials have a plateau at large values of the inflaton field, where the axion forms a flat direction. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry and special features of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ potentials, the theory exhibits an $\alpha$-attractor behavior: its cosmological predictions are stable with respect to significant modifications of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric version of this theory in the framework of $\overline {D3}$ induced geometric inflation. The choice of $\alpha$ is determined by underlying string compactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has $3\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\'e disk target for LiteBIRD</description>
