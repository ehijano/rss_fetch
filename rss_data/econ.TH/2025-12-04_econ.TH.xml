      <title>Aggregate then evaluate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We distinguish two frameworks for decisions under ambiguity: evaluate-then-aggregate (ETA) and aggregate-then-evaluate (ATE). Given a statistic that represents the decision maker's pure-risk preferences (such as expected utility) and an ambiguous act, an ETA model first evaluates the act under each plausible probabilistic model using this statistic and then aggregates the resulting evaluations according to ambiguity attitudes. In contrast, an ATE model first aggregates ambiguity by assigning the act a single representative distribution and then evaluates that distribution using the statistic. These frameworks differ in the order in which risk and ambiguity are processed, and they coincide when there is no ambiguity. While most existing ambiguity models fall within the ETA framework, our study focuses on the ATE framework, which is conceptually just as compelling and has been relatively neglected in the literature. We develop a Choquet ATE model, which generalizes the Choquet expected utility model by allowing arbitrary pure-risk preferences. We provide an axiomatization of this model in a Savage setting with an exogenous source of unambiguous events. The Choquet ATE framework allows us to analyze a wide range of ambiguity attitudes and their interplay with risk attitudes.</description>

      <title>From Micro-Distributions to Macro-Regularities: A Critique and Reconstruction of the Production Function Based on the Maximum Entropy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a micro-foundation for the Cobb-Douglas production function based on statistical physics, and to launch a critique of its political-economic implications. By introducing the Maximum Entropy Principle and an axiom of scale invariance, we prove that in an economic system with incomplete information, the most unbiased distribution of micro-level technical coefficients must take the form of a truncated power law. Based on this, statistical aggregation naturally leads to the emergence of a constant-returns-to-scale Cobb-Douglas function at the macro level. This result not only provides a micro-foundation for neoclassical growth models that does not rely on a representative agent or value aggregation of capital but, more importantly, reveals that the aggregate production function is essentially a lossy compression of micro-level information. In this compression process, the social-historical relations embedded in distribution parameters are 'naturalized' into seemingly eternal technical laws, which is the manifestation of Marx's critique of 'fetishism' at the level of mathematical logic. This paper further deepens the understanding of the production function as a statistical phenomenon rather than a technical law through dialogues with Marx, the Cambridge School, and Shaikh.</description>

      <title>A choice-based axiomatization of Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An axiomatic characterization of Nash equilibrium is provided for games in normal form. The Nash equilibrium correspondence is shown to be fully characterized by four simple and intuitive axioms, two of which are inspired by contraction and expansion consistency properties from the literature on abstract choice theory. The axiomatization applies to Nash equilibria in pure and mixed strategies alike, to games with strategy sets of any cardinality, and it does not require that players' preferences have a utility or expected utility representation.</description>

      <title>Payoff Continuity in Games of Incomplete Information Across Models of Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium predictions in games of incomplete information are sensitive to the assumed information structure. Monderer and Samet (1996) and Kajii and Morris (1998) define topological notions of proximity for common prior information structures such that two information structures are close if and only if (approximate) equilibrium payoffs are close. However, Monderer and Samet (1996) fix a common prior and define their topology on profiles of partitions over a state space, whereas Kajii and Morris (1998) define their topology on common priors over the product of a state space and a type space. We prove the open conjecture that two partition profiles are close in the Monderer and Samet (1996) topology if and only if there exists a labeling of types such that the associated common priors are close in the Kajii and Morris (1998) topology.</description>

      <title>Market share maximizing strategies of CAV fleet operators may cause chaos in our cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and equilibria of a new kind of routing games, where players - drivers of future autonomous vehicles - may switch between individual (HDV) and collective (CAV) routing. In individual routing, just like today, drivers select routes minimizing expected travel costs, whereas in collective routing an operator centrally assigns vehicles to routes. The utility is then the average experienced travel time discounted with individually perceived attractiveness of automated driving. The market share maximising strategy amounts to offering utility greater than for individual routing to as many drivers as possible. Our theoretical contribution consists in developing a rigorous mathematical framework of individualized collective routing and studying algorithms which fleets of CAVs may use for their market-share optimization. We also define bi-level CAV - HDV equilibria and derive conditions which link the potential marketing behaviour of CAVs to the behavioural profile of the human population. Practically, we find that the fleet operator may often be able to equilibrate at full market share by simply mimicking the choices HDVs would make. In more realistic heterogenous human population settings, however, we discover that the market-share maximizing fleet controller should use highly variable mixed strategies as a means to attract or retain customers. The reason is that in mixed routing the powerful group player can control which vehicles are routed via congested and uncongested alternatives. The congestion pattern generated by CAVs is, however, not known to HDVs before departure and so HDVs cannot select faster routes and face huge uncertainty whichever alternative they choose. Consequently, mixed market-share maximising fleet strategies resulting in unpredictable day-to-day driving conditions may, alarmingly, become pervasive in our future cities.</description>

      <title>Making school choice lotteries transparent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lotteries are commonly employed in school choice to fairly resolve priority ties; however, current practices typically keep students uninformed about their lottery outcomes at the time of preference submission. This paper advocates for revealing lottery information to students beforehand. When preference lists are constrained in length, which is a common feature in real-world systems, such disclosure reduces uncertainty and enables students to make more informed decisions. We demonstrate the benefits of lottery revelation through two stylized models. Theoretical predictions are supported by laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>A New Solution for Cooperative Game with Public Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel solution concept--the w-value--for cooperative games with public externalities. The w-value is axiomatically founded on three principles: Pareto Optimality (PO), Market Equilibrium (ME), and Fiscal Balance (FB), which together ensure a fair and economically sound distribution of gains. We establish its existence, uniqueness, and an accompanying implementation mechanism. A key theoretical advantage is its strong stability: the w-value lies within the core, specifically the {\gamma}-core making it resistant to coalitional deviations. Moreover, its computational efficiency facilitates practical application to complex real-world problems, offering a clear advantage over more cumbersome alternatives. These properties make the w-value a superior framework for analyzing cooperation under public externalities. A numerical illustration demonstrates the step-by-step calculation process. Finally, we apply the concept to international climate negotiations, showing how it provides a theoretical rationale for the shift from rigid mandatory emission reduction systems toward the flexible structure of Nationally Determined Contributions.</description>

      <title>Testing Single Crossing Property with Stochastic Choice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a typical model of private information and choice under uncertainty, a decision maker observes a signal, updates her prior beliefs using Bayes rule, and maximizes her expected utility. If the decision maker's utility function satisfies the single crossing property, and the information structure is ordered according to the monotone likelihood ratio, then the comparative statics exhibit monotonicity with respect to signals. We consider the restrictions placed by this model of signal processing on state conditional stochastic choice data. In particular, we show that this model rationalizes a state conditional stochastic choice dataset if and only if the dataset itself is ordered according to the monotone likelihood ratio. A straightforward application of the main result shows the conditions under which the analyst can infer when one DM is more informed than the other.</description>

      <title>Consistent solutions to the allocation of indivisible objects with general endowments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the consistency principle to examine various core concepts in a general allocation model that subsumes several familiar market design models as special cases. The conventional strong core is consistent but may be empty, whereas the exclusion core proposed by Balbuzanov and Kotowski (2019), although nonempty, is not consistent and may include unintuitive allocations. We therefore propose a refinement of the exclusion core, which is both nonempty and consistent. Our solution offers sharper predictions than alternatives and coincides with the strong core and/or the exclusion core in special cases that generalize familiar models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Asset Pricing with {\alpha}-MEU Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a dynamic asset pricing problem in which a representative agent is ambiguous about the aggregate endowment growth rate and trades a risky stock, human capital, and a risk-free asset to maximize her preference value of consumption represented by the {\alpha}-maxmin expected utility model. This preference model is known to be dynamically inconsistent, so we consider intra-personal equilibrium strategies for the representative agent and define the market equilibrium as the one in which the strategy that clears the market is an intra-personal equilibrium. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the market equilibrium and show that the asset prices in the equilibrium are the same as in the case when the agent does not perceive any ambiguity but believes in a particular probabilistic model of the endowment process. We show that with reasonable parameter values, the more ambiguity the agent perceives or the more ambiguity-averse she is, the lower the risk-free rate, the higher the stock price, the higher the stock risk premium, and the lower the stock volatility.</description>
