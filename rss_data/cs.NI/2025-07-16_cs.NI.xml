      <title>LiLM-RDB-SFC: Lightweight Language Model with Relational Database-Guided DRL for Optimized SFC Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective management of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and optimal Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement are critical challenges in modern Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) environments. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely adopted for dynamic network decision-making, its inherent dependency on structured data and fixed action rules often limits adaptability and responsiveness, particularly under unpredictable network conditions. This paper introduces LiLM-RDB-SFC, a novel approach combining Lightweight Language Model (LiLM) with Relational Database (RDB) to answer network state queries to guide DRL model for efficient SFC provisioning. Our proposed approach leverages two LiLMs, Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and the Fine-tuned Language Net T5 (FLAN-T5), to interpret network data and support diverse query types related to SFC demands, data center resources, and VNF availability. Results demonstrate that FLAN-T5 outperforms BART with a lower test loss (0.00161 compared to 0.00734), higher accuracy (94.79% compared to 80.2%), and less processing time (2h 2min compared to 2h 38min). Moreover, when compared to the large language model SQLCoder, FLAN-T5 matches the accuracy of SQLCoder while cutting processing time by 96% (SQLCoder: 54 h 43 min; FLAN-T5: 2 h 2 min).</description>

      <title>Arcturus: A Cloud Overlay Network for Global Accelerator with Enhanced Performance and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Accelerator (GA) services play a vital role in ensuring low-latency, high-reliability communication for real-time interactive applications. However, existing GA offerings are tightly bound to specific cloud providers, resulting in high costs, rigid deployment, and limited flexibility, especially for large-scale or budget-sensitive deployments. Arcturus is a cloud-native GA framework that revisits the design of GA systems by leveraging low-cost, heterogeneous cloud resources across multiple providers. Rather than relying on fixed, high-end infrastructure, Arcturus dynamically constructs its acceleration network and balances performance, stability, and resource efficiency. To achieve this, Arcturus introduces a two-plane design: a forwarding plane that builds a proxy network with adaptive control, and a scheduling plane that coordinates load and routing through lightweight, quantitative optimization. Evaluations under millions of RPS show that Arcturus outperforms commercial GA services by up to 1.7X in acceleration performance, reduces cost by 71%, and maintains over 80% resource efficiency--demonstrating efficient use of cloud resources at scale.</description>

      <title>SIMCODE: A Benchmark for Natural Language to ns-3 Network Simulation Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation across various domains. However, their effectiveness in generating simulation scripts for domain-specific environments like ns-3 remains underexplored. Despite the growing interest in automating network simulations, existing tools primarily focus on interactive automation over rigorous evaluation. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce SIMCODE, the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate ns-3 simulation code from natural language. SIMCODE includes 400 tasks across introductory, intermediate, and advanced levels, with solutions and test cases. Using SIMCODE, we evaluate three prominent LLMs, Gemini-2.0, GPT-4.1, and Qwen-3, across six prompt techniques. Furthermore, investigating task-specific fine-tuning's impact reveals that while GPT-4.1 outperforms others, execution accuracy remains modest, with substantial room for improvement. Error analysis identifies missing headers and API mismatches as dominant failures. Nevertheless, SIMCODE provides a foundational step toward evaluating LLMs and research in domain-aware generative systems.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Fingerprint Update Using Unlabelled WiFi Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi received signal strength (RSS) environment evolves over time due to movement of access points (APs), AP power adjustment, installation and removal of APs, etc. We study how to effectively update an existing database of fingerprints, defined as the RSS values of APs at designated locations, using a batch of newly collected unlabelled (possibly crowdsourced) WiFi signals. Prior art either estimates the locations of the new signals without updating the existing fingerprints or filters out the new APs without sufficiently embracing their features. To address that, we propose GUFU, a novel effective graph-based approach to update WiFi fingerprints using unlabelled signals with possibly new APs. Based on the observation that similar signal vectors likely imply physical proximity, GUFU employs a graph neural network (GNN) and a link prediction algorithm to retrain an incremental network given the new signals and APs. After the retraining, it then updates the signal vectors at the designated locations. Through extensive experiments in four large representative sites, GUFU is shown to achieve remarkably higher fingerprint adaptivity as compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, with error reduction of 21.4% and 29.8% in RSS values and location prediction, respectively.</description>

      <title>Improving Wi-Fi Network Performance Prediction with Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing need for robustness, reliability, and determinism in wireless networks for industrial and mission-critical applications is the driver for the growth of new innovative methods. The study presented in this work makes use of machine learning techniques to predict channel quality in a Wi-Fi network in terms of the frame delivery ratio. Predictions can be used proactively to adjust communication parameters at runtime and optimize network operations for industrial applications. Methods including convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory were analyzed on datasets acquired from a real Wi-Fi setup across multiple channels. The models were compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity. Results show that the frame delivery ratio can be reliably predicted, and convolutional neural networks, although slightly less effective than other models, are more efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory consumption. This enhances the model's usability on embedded and industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Resilient Time-Sensitive Networking for Industrial IoT: Configuration and Fault-Tolerance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is increasingly adopted in industrial systems to meet strict latency, jitter, and reliability requirements. However, evaluating TSN's fault tolerance under realistic failure conditions remains challenging. This paper presents IN2C, a modular OMNeT++/INET-based simulation framework that models two synchronized production cells connected to centralized infrastructure. IN2C integrates core TSN features, including time synchronization, traffic shaping, per-stream filtering, and Frame Replication and Elimination for Redundancy (FRER), alongside XML-driven fault injection for link and node failures. Four fault scenarios are evaluated to compare TSN performance with and without redundancy. Results show that FRER eliminates packet loss and achieves submillisecond recovery, though with 2-3x higher link utilization. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying TSN in bandwidth-constrained industrial environments.</description>

      <title>JamShield: A Machine Learning Detection System for Over-the-Air Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless networks are vulnerable to jamming attacks due to the shared communication medium, which can severely degrade performance and disrupt services. Despite extensive research, current jamming detection methods often rely on simulated data or proprietary over-the-air datasets with limited cross-layer features, failing to accurately represent the real state of a network and thus limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce JamShield, a dynamic jamming detection system trained on our own collected over-the-air and publicly available dataset. It utilizes hybrid feature selection to prioritize relevant features for accurate and efficient detection. Additionally, it includes an auto-classification module that dynamically adjusts the classification algorithm in real-time based on current network conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in detection rate, precision, and recall, along with reduced false alarms and misdetections compared to state-of-the-art detection algorithms, making JamShield a robust and reliable solution for detecting jamming attacks in real-world wireless networks.</description>

      <title>FAFO: Over 1 million TPS on a single node running EVM while still Merkleizing every block</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current blockchain execution throughput is limited by data contention, reducing execution layer parallelism. Fast Ahead-of-Formation Optimization (FAFO) is the first blockchain transaction scheduler to address this problem by reordering transactions before block formation for maximum concurrency. FAFO uses CPU-optimized cache-friendly Bloom filters to efficiently detect conflicts and schedule parallel transaction execution at high throughput and low overhead.
  We integrate the Rust EVM client (REVM) into FAFO and achieve over 1.1 million native ETH transfers per second and over half a million ERC20 transfers per second on a single node (Table 1), with 91% lower cost compared to state-of-the-art sharded execution. Unlike many other existing high throughput blockchain execution clients, FAFO uses QMDB to Merkleize world state after every block, enabling light clients and stateless validation for ZK-based vApps. FAFO scales with minimal synchronization overhead, scaling linearly with additional CPU resources until it fully exploits the maximum parallelism of the underlying transaction flow. FAFO proves that the high throughput necessary to support future decentralized applications can be achieved with a streamlined execution layer and innovations in blockchain transaction scheduler design. FAFO is open-sourced at https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/fafo.</description>

      <title>An Agentic Flow for Finite State Machine Extraction using Prompt Chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents. FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs. Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions, showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A Time-Triggered Communication Method Based on Urgency-Based Scheduler in Time-Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of the automotive industry and automation has led to a growing demand for time-critical systems to have low latency and jitter for critical traffic. To address this issue, the IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group proposed the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) to implement Time-Triggered (TT) communication, enabling deterministic transmission by assigning specific time windows to each stream. While Fixed Routing and Waiting-Allowed (FR-WA) scheduling algorithms offer flexibility, they suffer from inefficiencies in solution time and scalability. This study analyzes TAS implementation challenges, emphasizing how network scale expansion increases computational constraints. We propose an Urgency-Based Scheduler method (TT-UBS) to address these limitations to enhance deterministic transmission and computational efficiency under anomalies. A novel scheduling algorithm for TT-UBS parameter determination is developed, alongside simulations and comparative evaluations. Results show that TT-UBS guarantees deterministic traffic delivery while reducing solution time by 98.22% in test scenarios compared to traditional approaches. The methodology is extended to other scheduling algorithms to assess efficiency improvements. This advancement supports TSN's application in mission-critical systems by optimizing time-triggered communication performance and enabling reliable network deployment. The framework demonstrates significant potential for real-time in-vehicle networks requiring latency and jitter control.</description>

      <title>A Fast Solver-Free Algorithm for Traffic Engineering in Large-Scale Data Center Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid growth of data center networks (DCNs) poses significant challenges for large-scale traffic engineering (TE). Existing acceleration strategies, which rely on commercial solvers or deep learning, face scalability issues and struggle with degrading performance or long computational time. Unlike existing algorithms adopting parallel strategies, we propose Sequential Source-Destination Optimization (SSDO), a sequential solver-free algorithm for TE. SSDO decomposes the problem into subproblems, each focused on adjusting the split ratios for a specific source-destination (SD) demand while keeping others fixed. To enhance the efficiency of subproblem optimization, we design a Balanced Binary Search Method (BBSM), which identifies the most balanced split ratios among multiple solutions that minimize Maximum Link Utilization (MLU). SSDO dynamically updates the sequence of SDs based on real-time utilization, which accelerates convergence and enhances solution quality. We evaluate SSDO on Meta DCNs and two wide-area networks. In a Meta topology, SSDO achieves a 65\% and 60\% reduction in normalized MLU compared to TEAL and POP, two state-of-the-art TE acceleration methods, while delivering a $12\times$ speedup over POP. These results demonstrate the superior performance of SSDO in large-scale TE.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna-Aided Wireless Powered Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a novel pinching antenna (PA)-aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which multiple PAs are activated along a waveguide to establish robust line-of-sight links with multiple devices. Both time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocols are considered in the PA-WPCN. Moreover, some practical considerations, including a proportional power model for the PAs, a waveguide transmission loss model, and a nonlinear energy harvesting model, are incorporated into the PA-WPCN. Furthermore, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing resource allocation and PAs position. To address the challenging problem of the PAs position optimization, we propose a high-performance element-wise (EW) algorithm and a low-complexity stochastic parameter differential evolution (SPDE) algorithm. Numerical results validate the remarkable performance of the proposed PA-WPCN and the effectiveness of our algorithms, indicating that optimal performance is attained when the PA power distribution ratio of approximately 0.55-0.6.</description>

      <title>AoI-Energy-Spectrum Optimization in Post-Disaster Powered Communication Intelligent Network via Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper designs a post-disaster powered communication intelligent network (PDPCIN) to address communication disruptions caused by ground base station (GBS) failures within the post-disaster area. PDPCIN employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide wireless data collection (WDC) and wireless energy transmission (WET) for affected areas and leverages low earth orbit satellites (LEO SATs) to relay UAV data to the nearest survival GBS. To ensure basic post-disaster communication while co-optimizing age of information (AoI), energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency, intelligent synchronization-UAV (IS-UAV) architecture, AoI-based four thresholds updating (AFTU) mechanism, and Dynamic multi-LEO access (DMLA) strategy are proposed. However, three key challenges remain: time-varying task-resource imbalances, complex topology caused by multi-device scheduling, and nonlinear coupling in multidimensional metric optimization, making system optimization NP-hard. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical heterogeneous graph neural networks (HHGNN) framework. It models heterogeneous device nodes and their communication relations as a hierarchical heterogeneous graph structure, integrating our defined graph sensing, exchange, and mask layer to handle the network's input, feature propagation, and output. To search appropriate number of single-LEO SATs, we propose single-LEO SAT density optimization (S-LSDO) algorithm. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art benchmarks to validate its superior collaborative optimization of AoI, energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency. Based on this, we derive the expressions for the expected values of AoI and stagnant AoI proportion.</description>
