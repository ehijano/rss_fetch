      <title>English dictionaries, gold and silver standard corpora for biomedical natural language processing related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.09865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated information extraction with natural language processing (NLP) tools is required to gain systematic insights from the large number of COVID-19 publications, reports and social media posts, which far exceed human processing capabilities. A key challenge for NLP is the extensive variation in terminology used to describe medical entities, which was especially pronounced for this newly emergent disease. Here we present an NLP toolbox comprising very large English dictionaries of synonyms for SARS-CoV-2 (including variant names) and COVID-19, which can be used with dictionary-based NLP tools. We also present a silver standard corpus generated with the dictionaries, and a gold standard corpus, consisting of PubMed abstracts manually annotated for disease, virus, symptom, protein/gene, cell type, chemical and species terms, which can be used to train and evaluate COVID-19-related NLP tools. Code for annotation, which can be used to expand the silver standard corpus or for text mining is also included. This toolbox is freely available on GitHub (on https://github.com/Aitslab/corona) and zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6642275). The toolbox can be used for a variety of text analytics tasks related to the COVID-19 crisis and has already been used to create a COVID-19 knowledge graph, study the variability and evolution of COVID-19-related terminology and develop and benchmark text mining tools.</description>

      <title>On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reproducibility of computational research is critical for ensuring transparency, reliability and reusability. Challenges with computational reproducibility have been documented in several fields, but healthcare discrete-event simulation (DES) models have not been thoroughly examined in this context. This study assessed the computational reproducibility of eight published healthcare DES models (Python or R), selected to represent diverse contexts, complexities, and years of publication. Repositories and articles were also assessed against guidelines and reporting standards, offering insights into their relationship with reproducibility success. Reproducing results required up to 28 hours of troubleshooting per model, with 50% fully reproduced and 50% partially reproduced (12.5% to 94.1% of reported outcomes). Key barriers included the absence of open licences, discrepancies between reported and coded parameters, and missing code to produce model outputs, run scenarios, and generate tables and figures. Addressing these issues would often require relatively little effort from authors: adding an open licence and sharing all materials used to produce the article. Actionable recommendations are proposed to enhance reproducibility practices for simulation modellers and reviewers.</description>
