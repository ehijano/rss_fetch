      <title>A note on the Laplace transforms of certain generalized fractional integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive certain formulas giving the Laplace transforms of two generalized fractional integral operators introduced recently in [Fract. Calc. Appl. Anal. 20 (2) (2017), 422--446]. The main results provide generalizations to various known results. Some useful remarks related to the results presented in this paper are also mentioned.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of scalar functions and vector fields from weighted V-line transforms with swinging branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted V-line transforms map a symmetric tensor field of order $m\ge0$ to a linear combination of certain integrals of those fields along two rays emanating from the same vertex. A significant focus of current research in integral geometry centers on the inversion of V-line transforms in formally determined setups. Of particular interest are the restrictions of these operators in which the vertices of integration trajectories can be anywhere inside the support of the field, while the directions of the pair of rays, often called branches of the V-line, are determined by the vertex location. Such transforms have been thoroughly investigated under at least one of the following simplifying assumptions: the weights of integration along each branch are the same, while the branch directions are either constant or radial. In this paper we lift the first restriction and substitute the second one by a much weaker requirement in the case of transforms defined on scalar functions and vector fields. We extend multiple previously known results on the kernel description, injectivity, and inversion of the transforms with simplifying assumptions and prove pertinent statements for more general setups not studied before.</description>

      <title>Sharp microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for H\"ormander operators and spectral projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for H\"ormander operators with positive-definite Carleson--Sj\"olin phases and for spectral projectors on smooth, compact Riemannian manifolds. As an application, we obtain sharp $L^q\to L^p$ estimates for the aforementioned H\"ormander operators in odd dimensions, thereby completing the analysis in the odd-dimensional case. Further applications include $L^q\to L^p$ estimates for the Fourier extension operator, $L^p$ estimates for the Bochner--Riesz operator, microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions, and $L^p$ estimates for Hecke--Maass forms on compact $3$-dimensional arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Pinned distances and density theorems in $\mathbb R^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a pinned variant of Bourgain's theorem, concerning the occurrence of affine copies of $k$-point patterns in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Focusing on the case $k=2$, which corresponds to pinned distances, we show that the classical conclusion does not extend to the pinned setting: there exist sets of positive upper density in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 2$, such that no single pinned point determines all sufficiently large distances. However, we establish a weaker quantitative result: for every point $x$ in such a set, the pinned distance set at $x$ has (one-dimensional) positive upper density. We also construct an example demonstrating the sharpness of this bound. These findings highlight a structural distinction between global and pinned configurations.</description>

Abstract: We use a new approach with a matrix transformation to obtain a new global solvability criterion for matrix Riccati equations. The proven theorem completes an well known result in directions of extension of classes of coefficient of equations and of extension of initial values,under which the solutions of equations are continuable to $\infty$.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for Painlev\'e 5 and nonlinear monodromy-Stokes structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under a generic condition we capture all the solutions of Painlev\'e 5 equation in a right half plane near the point at infinity, that is, we show that, by the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, classified collections of asymptotic solutions may be labelled with monodromy data filling up the whole monodromy manifold. To do so, in addition to the asymptotics by Andreev and Kitaev along the positive real axis, we deal with elliptic asymptotics and truncated solutions arising from a family of solutions along the imaginary axes. To know analytic continuations outside this region we propose a formulation of nonlinear monodromy-Stokes structure based on the monodromy data, which provides an expression of nonlinear monodromy actions on the character variety.</description>

      <title>The head wave transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new integral ray transform called the head wave transform. The head wave transform integrates a function along a piecewise linear (in general geodesic) path consisting of three parts. The geometry of such paths corresponds to ray paths of head waves propagating in a medium with sharp changes in sound speed. The middle part of the ray paths corresponds to gliding along the so-called gliding surface. As our main results, we prove inversion formulas and kernel characterizations under multiple different sets of assumptions on the geometry of gliding surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator $M$ is bounded on the variable Lebesgue space $L^{p(\cdot)}(X,d,\mu)$ with $1&lt;p_-\le p_+&lt;\infty$, over an unbounded space of homogeneous type $(X,d,\mu)$ with a Borel-semiregular measure $\mu$, if and only if the averaging operators $T_\mathcal{Q}$ are bounded on $L^{p(\cdot)}(X,d,\mu)$ uniformly over all families $\mathcal{Q}$ of pairwise disjoint ``cubes'' from the Hyt\"onen--Kairema dyadic system with a distinguished center point. This is an analogue, in the setting of spaces of homogeneous type, of Diening's well-known characterization of the boundedness of $M$ on $L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a service for the solid mechanics community we gather in this paper constitutive properties of a collective list of isotropic elastic energies for compressible materials. Of interest to us are the invertibility and monotonicity of certain stress-strain pairs. The calculations are done numerically by our own evaluation algorithm and presented in a yes/no-table. Such an overview has been missing up to now. It is intended to expand the table with further energies as time goes on and updates will be found on arxive.</description>

      <title>On Hardy spaces associated with the twisted Laplacian and sharp estimates for the corresponding wave operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove various equivalent characterisations of the Hardy space $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ for $0&lt;p&lt;1$ associated with the twisted Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$ which generalises the result of [MPR81] for the case $p=1$. Using the atomic characterisation of $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ corresponding to the twisted convolution, we prove sharp boundedness result for the wave operator $\mathcal{L}^{-\delta/2}e^{\pm it\sqrt{\mathcal{L}}}$ for a fixed $t&gt;0$ on $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. More precisely we prove that it is a bounded operator from $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ to $L^p(\mathbb{C}^n)$ for $ 0&lt;p\leq 1$ and $\delta\geq (2n-1)\left(1/p-1/2\right)$.</description>

      <title>Sharp gradient stability for a class of Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability problem for a class of Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities with non-radial extremal functions. We prove that the Euler-Lagrange equations are non-degenerate and obtain a sharp global quantitative stability. The presence of partial (stronger) singular weight brings substantial new challenges, requiring us to significantly refine the techniques from \cite{DT1,FN,FZ} and introduce some new ideas to handle both the cylindrical symmetry of non-radial extremal functions and the partial (stronger) singular weight structure. Key technical innovations include new compact embedding with strong singularity and new refined spectral inequalities that are crucial for our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new version of the well-known Birkhoff-Kellogg invariant-direction Theorem in product spaces. Our results concern operator systems and give the existence of component-wise eigenvalues, instead of scalar eigenvalues as in the classical case, that have corresponding eigenvectors with all components nontrivial and localized by their norm. We also show that, when applied to nonlinear eigenvalue problems for differential equations, this localization property of the eigenvectors provides, in turn, qualitative properties of the solutions. This is illustrated in two context of systems of PDEs and ODEs. We illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results with two explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Growth Model with Discontinuity: A Link between Monostable and Bistable Traveling Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify traveling waves and stationary solutions of a reaction-diffusion equation arising in population dynamics with Allee-type effects. The reaction term is given by a quadratic polynomial with a discontinuity at zero, which captures finite-time extinction for sub-threshold populations. This discontinuity induces a free boundary in the wave profile, a phenomenon that distinguishes the model from the classical logistic or Allen-Cahn equations. A complete scenario is presented that connects monostable and bistable traveling waves through the wave speed parameter, thereby providing a unified framework for their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Global and local maximizers for some Fourier extension estimates on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study maximizers for Fourier extension inequalities on the sphere. We prove that constant functions are local maximizers for the $L^p(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ Fourier extension estimates in the same range of exponents $p$ for which they are global maximizers for the $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ to $L^p_{rad}L^2_{ang}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ mixed-norm Fourier extension inequalities. Moreover, in the case of low dimensions, we improve the range of exponents for which constant functions are known to be the unique global maximizers for the $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ to $L^p_{rad}L^2_{ang}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ mixed-norm Fourier extension estimate on the sphere, covering, for the case of dimensions $d=2,3$, the entire Stein-Tomas range. This is achieved by establishing novel hierarchies between certain weighted norms of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>Bounding the dimension of exceptional sets for orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is an analytic set of Hausdorff dimension $a$, then $\dim_H(\pi_VA)=\min\{a,k\}$ for a.e.\ $V\in G(n,k)$, where $G(n,k)$ denotes the set of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\pi_V$ is the orthogonal projection of $A$ onto $V$. In this paper we study how large the exceptional set
  \begin{equation*}
  \{V\in G(n,k) \mid \dim_H(\pi_V A) &lt; s\}
  \end{equation*}
  can be for a given $s\le\min\{a,k\}.$ We improve previously known estimates on the dimension of the exceptional set, and we show that our estimates are sharp for $k=1$ and for $k=n-1$. Hence we completely resolve this question for $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Singular integrals on $C^{1,\alpha}$ intrinsic graphs in step 2 Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study singular integral operators induced by Calder\'on-Zygmund kernels in any step-$2$ Carnot group $\mathbb{G}$. We show that if such an operator satisfies some natural cancellation conditions then it is $L^2$ bounded on all intrinsic graphs of $C^{1,\alpha}$ functions over vertical hyperplanes that do not have rapid growth at $\infty$.
  In particular, the result applies to the Riesz operator $\mathcal{R}$ induced by the kernel $$ \mathsf{R}(z)= \nabla_{\mathbb{G}} \Gamma(z), \quad z\in \mathbb{G}\backslash \{0\}, $$ the horizontal gradient of the fundamental solution of the sub-Laplacian. The $L^2$ boundedness of $\mathcal{R}$ is connected with the question of removability for Lipschitz harmonic functions. As a corollary of our result, we infer that closed subsets of the intrinsic graphs mentioned above are non-removable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let the infinite convolutions \begin{equation*}
  \mu_{\{R_{k}\},\{D_{k}\}}=\delta_{R_{1}^{-1}D_{1}}*\delta_{R_{1}^{-1}R_{2}^{-1}D_{2}}*\delta_{R_{1}^{-1}R_{2}^{-1}R_{3}^{-1}D_{3}}*\dotsi \end{equation*}
  be generated by the sequence of pairs \(\{ (R_k,D_k) \}_{k=1}^{\infty} \), where $ R_k\in M_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is an expanding integer matric, $D_k$ is a finite integer digit sets that satisfies the following two conditions: (i). \( \# D_k = m \) and \( m&gt;2 \) is a prime; (ii). \( \{x: \sum_{d\in D_{k}}e^{2\pi i\langle d,x \rangle}=0\} =\cup_{i=1}^{\phi(k)}\cup_{j=1}^{m-1}(\frac{j}{m}\nu_{k,i}+\mathbb{Z}^{n}) \) for some \( \nu_{k,i} \in \{ (l_1, \cdots, l_n)^t : l_i \in [1, m-1] \cap \mathbb{Z}, 1\leq i\leq n \} \). In this paper, we study the spectrality of $\mu_{\{R_{k}\},\{D_{k}\}}$, and some necessary and sufficient conditions for \( L^{2}(\mu_{\{R_{k}\},\{D_{k}\}}) \) to have an orthogonal exponential function basis are established. Finally, we discuss the explanations and applications of our results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of matrix orthogonal polynomials on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain large degree strong asymptotics for matrix orthogonal polynomials with respect to exponential weights on the real line. The expansions hold for the variable $z$ in different regions of the complex plane, and the asymptotic behavior of recurrence coefficients and norms is obtained as well. The main tools are the Riemann-Hilbert formulation and the Deift-Zhou method of steepest descent, adapted to the matrix case. A central role in this analysis is played by the matrix Szeg\H{o} function, an object that has independent interest in the study of matrix orthogonal polynomials.</description>

Abstract: The initial value spaces of the Painlev\'{e} equations are proposed by Okamoto. They are symplectic manifolds in which the Painlev\'{e} equations are described as polynomial Hamiltonian systems on all coordinates. In this article, we construct an initial value space of the fourth order Painlev\'{e} system with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $A_5^{(1)}\times A_1^{(1)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the best known lower bound for the dimension of radial projections of sets in the plane. We show that if $X,Y$ are Borel sets in $\R^2$, $X$ is not contained in any line and $\dim_H(X)&gt;0$, then
  $$\sup\limits_{x\in X} \dim_H(\pi_x Y) \geq \min\left\{(\dim_H(Y) + \dim_H(X))/2, \dim_H(Y), 1\right\},$$ where $\pi_x Y$ is the radial projection of the set $Y$ from the point $x$.</description>

      <title>Full characterization of optimal transport plans for concave costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3406</link>
      <description>arXiv:1311.3406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper slightly improves a classical result by Gangbo and McCann (1996) about the structure of optimal transport plans for costs that are concave functions of the Euclidean distance. Since the main difficulty for proving the existence of an optimal map comes from the possible singularity of the cost at $0$, everything is quite easy if the supports of the two measures are disjoint; Gangbo and McCann proved the result under the assumption $\mu(\mathm{supp}(\nu))=0$; in this paper we replace this assumption with the fact that the two measures are singular to each other. In this case it is possible to prove the existence of an optimal transport map, provided the starting measure $\mu$ does not give mass to small sets (i.e. $(d-1)$-rectifiable sets). When the measures are not singular the optimal transport plan decomposes into two parts, one concentrated on the diagonal and the other being a transport map between mutually singular measures.</description>

      <title>Affine Isoperimetric Inequalities for Higher-Order Projection and Centroid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th order difference body of a convex body, and also established the $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. In this paper, we extend this idea to the projection body, centroid body, and radial mean bodies, as well as prove the associated inequalities (analogues of Zhang's projection inequality, Petty's projection inequality, the Busemann-Petty centroid inequality and Busemann's random simplex inequality). We also establish a new proof of Schneider's $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. As an application, a $m$th-order affine Sobolev inequality for functions of bounded variation is provided.</description>

      <title>A second order approach to the Kato square root problem on open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the Kato square root property for coupled second-order elliptic systems in divergence form subject to mixed boundary conditions on an open and possibly unbounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ under two simple geometric conditions: The Dirichlet boundary parts for the respective components are Ahlfors--David regular and a quantitative connectivity property in the spirit of locally uniform domains holds near the remaining Neumann boundary parts. In contrast to earlier work, our proof is not based on the first-order approach due to Axelsson--Keith--McIntosh but uses a second-order approach in the spirit of the original solution to the Kato square root problem on Euclidean space. This way, the proof becomes substantially shorter and technically less demanding.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results for the Schr\"odinger equation cover prior work of Nakamura, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We construct examples to show these results can be saturated on the sphere, and we can improve them on the flat torus by using Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem to obtain new decoupling inequalities for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As an application, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Most Probable KAM Tori in Stochastic Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper conducts an in-depth investigation into the impact of stochastic perturbations-particularly multiplicative noise-on the integrable structures of Hamiltonian systems, with a central focus on developing a KAM theory for stochastic Hamiltonian dynamics. We begin by deriving the Onsager-Machlup functional for Hamiltonian systems driven by multiplicative noise and identifying the most probable transition paths of system trajectories. This analysis reveals the fundamental differences in how additive versus multiplicative noise influences the integrability of Hamiltonian systems. Building upon this, we establish a large deviation principle for the system and derive a rate function that quantitatively characterizes trajectory deviations, especially in the regime of rare events. The main contribution of this work lies in demonstrating that, under the small noise limit, the quasi-periodic invariant tori of the unperturbed system persist in a probabilistic sense, indicating the stability of KAM structures under stochastic perturbations. Furthermore, we show that the exponential rate of deviation from the invariant tori exactly matches the large deviation rate function, thus providing a quantitative characterization of the structural persistence and fluctuation geometry of quasi-periodic motions in stochastic Hamiltonian systems. These results extend the classical KAM framework to a stochastic setting and offer new insights into the behavior of complex dynamical systems under the influence of noise.</description>
