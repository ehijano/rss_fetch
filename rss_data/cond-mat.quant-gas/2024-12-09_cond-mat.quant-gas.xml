      <title>Excitation spectrum of a double supersolid in a trapped dipolar Bose mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates are excellent platforms for studying supersolidity, characterized by coexisting density modulation and superfluidity. The realization of dipolar mixtures opens intriguing new scenarios, most remarkably the possibility of realizing a double supersolid, composed by two interacting superfluids. We analyze the complex excitation spectrum of a miscible trapped dipolar Bose mixture, showing that it provides key insights about the double supersolid regime. We show that this regime may be readily probed experimentally by monitoring the appearance of a doublet of superfluid compressional modes, linked to the different superfluid character of each component. Additionally, the dipolar supersolid mixture exhibits a non-trivial spin nature of the dipolar rotons, the Higgs excitation, and the low-lying Goldstone modes. Interestingly, the analysis of the lowest-lying modes allows for monitoring the transition of just one of the components into the incoherent droplet regime, whereas the other remains coherent, highlighting their disparate superfluid properties.</description>

      <title>Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems, and associated phenomena, such as measurement-induced phase transitions, have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. To this end, we study the effects of continuous weak measurements and feedback control on isolated JJAs in the absence of any external thermal bath. The monitoring due to combined effect of measurements and feedback, inducing non-unitary evolution and dissipation, leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering the semiclassical, strong measurement/feedback and weak-coupling limits, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tripling Fluctuations and Peaked Sound Speed in Fermionic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crossover involving three-fermion clusters is relevant to the hadron-quark crossover, which, if occurring in a neutron star, could naturally reproduce the dense-matter equation of state recently deduced from simultaneous observations of neutron-star masses and radii. To understand the crossover mechanism, we examine the role of tripling fluctuations induced by the formation of three-fermion clusters. The phase-shift representation of fluctuations manifests an interplay of bound and scattering states, leading to non-monotonic momentum distributions of baryon-like clusters and peaked sound speed at finite densities. We demonstrate them by applying our approach to a nonrelativistic system of one-dimensional three-color fermions analogous to the hadron-quark matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cherenkov transition of finite momentum Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of a finite-momentum impurity immersed in a weakly interacting three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultra-cold atoms, giving a detailed account of the dynamical quantum Cherenkov transition discussed in Ref. [arXiv:2101.00030]. Using a time-dependent variational approach, we identify a transition in the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of the system after the attractive short-range impurity-boson interaction is quenched on. The transition occurs as the impurity's velocity crosses an interaction-dependent critical value, and manifests in the long-time behavior of the Loschmidt echo and average impurity velocity. This behavior is also reflected in the finite momentum ground state of the system, where the group velocity of the interaction-dressed impurity loses it's dependence on the total momentum of the system as the critical point is crossed. The transition we discuss should be experimentally observable via a variety of common protocols in ultracold atomic systems such as time-of-flight imaging, RF spectroscopy, Ramsey interferometry, and absorption imaging.</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for studying the heteronuclear Efimov effect with an ultracold mixture of $^6$Li and $^{133}$Cs atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the experimental apparatus enabling the observation of the heteronuclear Efimov effect in an optically trapped ultracold mixture of $^6$Li-$^{133}$Cs with high-resolution control of the interactions. A compact double-species Zeeman slower consisting of four interleaving helical coils allows for a fast-switching between two optimized configurations for either Li or Cs and provides an efficient sequential loading into their respective MOTs. By means of a bichromatic optical trapping scheme based on species-selective trapping we prepare mixtures down to 100 nK of 1$\times$ 10$^4$ Cs atoms and 7$\times$ 10$^3$ Li atoms. Highly stable magnetic fields allow high-resolution atom-loss spectroscopy and enable to resolve splitting in the loss feature of a few tens of milligauss. These features allowed for a detailed study of the Efimov effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the many-body Hamiltonian describing a mobile impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using exact unitary transformations and rigorous error estimates, we show the validity of the Bogoliubov-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian for the Bose polaron in the regime of moderately strong, repulsive interactions with a dilute BEC. Moreover, we calculate analytically the universal logarithmic correction to the ground state energy that arises from an impurity mediated phonon-phonon interaction.</description>

Abstract: We study a dilute system of $N$ interacting bosons coupled to an impurity particle via a pair potential in the Gross--Pitaevskii regime. We derive an expansion of the ground state energy up to order one in the boson number, and show that the difference of excited eigenvalues to the ground state is given by the eigenvalues of the renormalized Bogoliubov--Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian in the limit $N\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several critical metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We lay out a detailed, near-term plan to enable zone-based quantum computing with $\sim$6,000 atoms, and demonstrate a crucial ingredient thereof: coherent moves of up to 610 $\mu$m with a fidelity of $\sim$99.95%, as characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-integrable higher spin Kitaev honeycomb model has an exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure, which exclusively identifies quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the half-integer spin Kitaev model. But its constraints for the integer-spin Kitaev model are much limited, and even trivially gapped insulators cannot be excluded. The physical implications of exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure, especially $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes, in integer-spin models remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we theoretically show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry) possesses a topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state for any spin (both integer and half-integer spin) by constructing exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges. We further show that the conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux can also demonstrate the intriguing spin fractionalization phenomena in the nonabelian topological order phase of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model. Its deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex excitation carries fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum number in the low-energy subspace, which is also an nonabelian anyon. Our exact manifestation of spin fractionalization in an integer-spin model is rather rare in previous studies, and is absent in the Kitaev honeycomb model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonpolar atoms or molecules with low particle mass and weak inter-particle interactions can form quantum liquids and solids (QLS) at low temperatures. Excess electrons naturally bind to the surfaces of QLS in a vacuum, exhibiting unique quantum electronic behaviors in two and lower dimensions. This article reviews the historical development and recent progress in this field. Key topics include collective and individual electron transport on liquid helium, solid neon, and solid hydrogen; theoretical proposals and experimental efforts toward single-electron qubits on superfluid helium; the recent experimental realization of single-electron charge qubits on solid neon; and related theoretical calculations. Finally, we discuss and envision future exploration of quantum electronics in heterogeneous QLS systems.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated quantum gates in trapped ions coupled to an ultracold atomic gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of phonon-mediated qubit-qubit interactions between trapped ions in the presence of an ultracold atomic gas. By deriving and solving a master equation to describe the combined system, we show that the presence of the atoms causes the quantum gate quality to reduce because of motional decoherence. On the other hand, we calculate that the gas may be used to keep the ion crystal cold in the presence of external heating due to electric field noise. We show that tuning the atom-ion scattering length allows one to tune the cooling rate of the ions and would make it possible to temporarily reduce the effects of the gas during a quantum gate while keeping the ions cold over long timescales. In this way, the trapped ion quantum computer may be buffer gas cooled. The system may also be used for quantum-enhanced measurements of the atom-ion interactions or properties of the atomic bath.</description>
