      <title>Commissioning of a compact multibend achromat lattice: A new 3 GeV synchrotron radiation facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NanoTerasu, a new 3 GeV synchrotron light source in Japan, began user operation in April 2024. It provides high-brilliance soft to tender X-rays and covers a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to tender X-rays. Its compact storage ring with a circumference of 349 m is based on a four-bend achromat lattice to provide two straight sections in each cell for insertion devices with a natural horizontal emittance of 1.14 nm rad, which is small enough for soft X-rays users. The NanoTerasu accelerator incorporates several innovative technologies, including a full-energy injector C-band linear accelerator with a length of 110 m, an in-vacuum off-axis injection system, a four-bend achromat with B-Q combined bending magnets, and a TM020 mode accelerating cavity with built-in higher-order-mode dampers in the storage ring. This paper presents the accelerator machine commissioning over a half-year period and our model-consistent ring optics correction. The first user operation with a stored beam current of 160 mA is also reported. We summarize the storage ring parameters obtained from the commissioning. This is helpful for estimating the effective optical properties of synchrotron radiation at NanoTerasu.</description>

      <title>Effect of solenoid lens field on electron beam emittance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an injector system of an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL), solenoid lenses are typically used to confine low-emittance electron beams to low-energy region below a few MeV. Because non-thermionic emittance at such a low-energy region is easily deteriorated by nonlinear electromagnetic fields, it is important to determine the properties of a solenoid lens on electron beam emittance in the design of XFEL injectors. We derived an approximate solution to emittance growth due to lens aberration by a paraxial approximation. It was found that the derivative of the longitudinal magnetic field strongly affects beam emittance, and its growth is proportional to the fourth power of the beam radius. Various properties of the beam can be analyzed as long as the longitudinal magnetic field distribution is prepared using a simulation or measurement. In this study, a theoretical procedure to obtain the emittance growth in the solenoid lens is introduced and the design considerations of the solenoid lens of the SACLA injector are described.</description>

      <title>Sunbeam: Near-Sun Statites as Beam Platforms for Beam-Driven Rockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a method of beamed power for propulsion that utilizes relativistic electron beams. The physics of charged particle beam propagation in the space plasma environment is discussed and the long-range (&gt;100 A.U.) advantage of relativistic electron beams is emphasized. A preliminary statite based beam emitter for powering probes to ~0.1c is proposed and the challenges in beam-power uses are explored.</description>
