      <title>HyperGraphOS: A Modern Meta-Operating System for the Scientic and Engineering Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents HyperGraphOS, a significant innovation in the domain of operating systems, specifically designed to address the needs of scientific and engineering domains. This platform aims to combine model-based engineering, graph modeling, data containers, and documents, along with tools for handling computational elements. HyperGraphOS functions as an Operating System offering to users an infinite workspace for creating and managing complex models represented as graphs with customizable semantics. By leveraging a web-based architecture, it requires only a modern web browser for access, allowing organization of knowledge, documents, and content into models represented in a network of workspaces. Elements of the workspace are defined in terms of domain-specific languages (DSLs). These DSLs are pivotal for navigating workspaces, generating code, triggering AI components, and organizing information and processes. The models' dual nature as both visual drawings and data structures allows dynamic modifications and inspections both interactively as well as programaticaly. We evaluated HyperGraphOS's efficiency and applicability across a large set of diverse domains, including the design and development of a virtual Avatar dialog system, a robotic task planner based on large language models (LLMs), a new meta-model for feature-based code development and many others. Our findings show that HyperGraphOS offers substantial benefits in the interaction with a computer as information system, as platoform for experiments and data analysis, as streamlined engineering processes, demonstrating enhanced flexibility in managing data, computation and documents, showing an innovative approaches to persistent desktop environments.</description>

      <title>ASC-Hook: fast and transparent system call hook for Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intercepting system calls is crucial for tools that aim to modify or monitor application behavior. However, existing system call interception tools on the ARM platform still suffer from limitations in terms of performance and completeness. This paper presents an efficient and comprehensive binary rewriting framework, ASC-Hook, specifically designed for intercepting system calls on the ARM platform. ASC-Hook addresses two key challenges on the ARM architecture: the misalignment of the target address caused by directly replacing the SVC instruction with br x8, and the return to the original control flow after system call interception. This is achieved through a hybrid replacement strategy and our specially designed trampoline mechanism. By implementing multiple completeness strategies specifically for system calls, we ensured comprehensive and thorough interception. Experimental results show that ASC-Hook reduces overhead to at least 1/29 of that of existing system call interception tools. We conducted extensive performance evaluations of ASC-Hook, and the average performance loss for system call-intensive applications is 3.7\% .</description>
