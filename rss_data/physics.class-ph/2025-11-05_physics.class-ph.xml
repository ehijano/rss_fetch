      <title>Coulomb force between two Dirac monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of magnetic monopoles that was proposed by Paul Dirac in 1931 has long been a subject of theoretical interest in physics because of its potential to explain the quantization of electric charge. While much attention has been given to non-Dirac monopoles, Dirac's model, which involves an infinitely thin solenoid known as a Dirac string, presents subtleties in the interaction between monopoles. In this paper, we show that the force between two Dirac monopoles obeys a Coulomb-like interaction law. This derivation offers an instructive exercise in fundamental electromagnetism concepts and is appropriate for undergraduate and early graduate-level students.</description>

      <title>Characterization Of Cyclic Hygrothermal Swelling And Shrinkage Behavior Of Balsa Wood And Gfrp-Balsa Sandwich Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of developing bio-based composite sandwich structures with greener core materials is to facilitate the decarbonization of industries such as aviation and maritime. This field of research has received increasing attention over the past decades. For example, balsa wood has emerged as a highly promising alternative to foam or honeycomb cores, offering a lightweight, rapidly renewable and cost-effective solution. However, plant fibers such as balsa wood and flax often display high hydrophilic behavior, which could affect their mechanical performance and long-term durability. It is therefore imperative to promote further research into the characterization of the cyclic hygrothermal aging behavior of balsa wood core sandwich structures, in particular the identification of moistureinduced strains and internal stresses in the skins and cores, as well as the investigation of moisture desorption processes and the associated thermal shrinkage phenomena in wood fibers, resins and glass fibers. Accordingly, this work employs two complete moisture absorption-desorption cycles to characterize the moisture diffusion behavior of specimens comprising three different materials, including the pure balsa wood, resin-infused balsa and balsa core sandwich structures with two Glass-Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer (GFRP) skins. The changes in moisture content and hygroscopic strains in the thickness, length and width directions of all specimens were investigated with a view to identifying the hygroscopic swelling and thermal shrinkage behaviors exhibited during long-term aging cycles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions Across Slow and Fast Regimes in a Two-Tone Driven Duffing Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives, governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime, where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states. We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting circuit platforms.</description>

      <title>The cycloid as brachistochrone: A one-page proof, from first principles, without calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Johann Bernoulli's optical solution of the brachistochrone problem is rebuilt on underlying (non-optical) principles. An "optical interpretation" is given afterwards.</description>
