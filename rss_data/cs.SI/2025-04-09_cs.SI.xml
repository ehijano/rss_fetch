      <title>Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06160v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</description>

      <title>Topic-aware Most Influential Community Search in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influential community search (ICS) finds a set of densely connected and high-impact vertices from a social network. Although great effort has been devoted to ICS problems, most existing methods do not consider how relevant the influential community found is to specific topics. A few attempts at topic-aware ICS problems cannot capture the stochastic nature of community formation and influence propagation in social networks. To address these issues, we introduce a novel problem of topic-aware most influential community search (TAMICS) to discover a set of vertices such that for a given topic vector q, they induce a $(k, l, \eta)$-core in an uncertain directed interaction graph and have the highest influence scores under the independent cascade (IC) model. We propose an online algorithm to provide an approximate result for any TAMICS query with bounded errors. Furthermore, we design two index structures and an index-based heuristic algorithm for efficient TAMICS query processing. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed approaches on various real-world datasets. The results show that (1) the communities of TAMICS have higher relevance and social influence w.r.t.~the query topics as well as structural cohesiveness than those of several state-of-the-art topic-aware and influential CS methods and (2) the index-based algorithm achieves speed-ups of up to three orders of magnitude over the online algorithm with an affordable overhead for index construction.</description>

      <title>Measuring changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present new methods of measuring polarisation in social networks. We use Random Dot Product Graphs to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of this social network then provider an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We demonstrate this method by analysing social networks such as communication interactions among New Zealand Twitter users discussing climate change issues and international social media discussions of the COP conferences. In both cases, the decreasing embedded dimensionality indicates that these networks have become more polarised over time. We also use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation processes.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Political Misinformation Over the Past Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although misinformation tends to spread online, it can have serious real-world consequences. In order to develop automated tools to detect and mitigate the impact of misinformation, researchers must leverage algorithms that can adapt to the modality (text, images and video), the source, and the content of the false information. However, these characteristics tend to change dynamically across time, making it challenging to develop robust algorithms to fight misinformation spread. Therefore, this paper uses natural language processing to find common characteristics of political misinformation over a twelve year period. The results show that misinformation has increased dramatically in recent years and that it has increasingly started to be shared from sources with primary information modalities of text and images (e.g., Facebook and Instagram), although video sharing sources containing misinformation are starting to increase (e.g., TikTok). Moreover, it was discovered that statements expressing misinformation contain more negative sentiment than accurate information. However, the sentiment associated with both accurate and inaccurate information has trended downward, indicating a generally more negative tone in political statements across time. Finally, recurring misinformation categories were uncovered that occur over multiple years, which may imply that people tend to share inaccurate statements around information they fear or don't understand (Science and Medicine, Crime, Religion), impacts them directly (Policy, Election Integrity, Economic) or Public Figures who are salient in their daily lives. Together, it is hoped that these insights will assist researchers in developing algorithms that are temporally invariant and capable of detecting and mitigating misinformation across time.</description>

      <title>Fully-inductive Node Classification on Arbitrary Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20445v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One fundamental challenge in graph machine learning is generalizing to new graphs. Many existing methods following the inductive setup can generalize to test graphs with new structures, but assuming the feature and label spaces remain the same as the training ones. This paper introduces a fully-inductive setup, where models should perform inference on arbitrary test graphs with new structures, feature and label spaces. We propose GraphAny as the first attempt at this challenging setup. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, which can be naturally applied to graphs with any feature and label spaces. To further build a stronger model with learning capacity, we fuse multiple LinearGNN predictions with learned inductive attention scores. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance features between pairs of LinearGNN predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on a single Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26%, surpassing not only all inductive baselines, but also strong transductive methods trained separately on each of the 30 test graphs.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing-Based Knowledge Graph Construction for Drug Side Effects Using Large Language Models with an Application on Semaglutide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media is a rich source of real-world data that captures valuable patient experience information for pharmacovigilance. However, mining data from unstructured and noisy social media content remains a challenging task. We present a systematic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract medication side effects from social media and organize them into a knowledge graph (KG). We apply this framework to semaglutide for weight loss using data from Reddit. Using the constructed knowledge graph, we perform comprehensive analyses to investigate reported side effects across different semaglutide brands over time. These findings are further validated through comparison with adverse events reported in the FAERS database, providing important patient-centered insights into semaglutide's side effects that complement its safety profile and current knowledge base of semaglutide for both healthcare professionals and patients. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to transform social media data into structured KGs for pharmacovigilance.</description>
