      <title>Brownian Motion of the Quantum States on a String and the Polyakov Action of String Theory: Is String Theory a Quantum Mechanical Model of the Brain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brownian motion of a number of quantum states in a compact one-dimensional space is studied via the Wiener fractal measure, and it is shown that the derived path-integral measure coincides precisely with the Polyakov path-integral formula for bosonic string theory. Thus, it is concluded that the Polyakov action of bosonic string theory does not have a unique, distinguishable foundation specifically dedicated to describing the fundamental forces of nature, but rather, it is merely a standard formulation of the Wiener stochastic process for Brownian motion of the quantum states on one-dimensional objects. It is also demonstrated that the time-dimension field is, in practice, the localization of the non-local effects of the coordinate fields. This indicates that the interpretation intended for spacetime fields in the formulation of string theory allegedly faces fundamental flaws in its underlying theoretical aspects. In this regard, we will defend string theory against its experimental flaws in particle physics due to unreliable interpretation of the theory and relate its elaborated mathematical framework to another significant topic: Quantum Brain. ....</description>

      <title>On the Dual-Phase-Lag thermal response in the Pulsed Photoacoustic effect: 1D approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Photoacoustic (PA) effect is the mechanism to convert non-ionizing electromagnetic energy into mechanical one; its main application is PA imaging in biomedicine. In this work, and in order to consider the heat flux non-heuristically, we obtained exact solutions of a 1D boundary value problem of the Dual-Phase-Lag (DPL) heat conduction equation for a three-layer system in the frequency domain; once the thermal boundary problem was solved via the DPL model, the second derivative of temperature solutions were considered as the PA source in the respective 1D boundary value problem for the pressures, via the PA wave equation. Temperature and pressure solutions were explored by assuming two considerations; being the first one, that the characteristic thermal lag response time $\tau_{_T}$ related with the DPL heat conduction model, is a free parameter on this effective model. The second one is that for the sake of simplicity, the whole is system is assumed to have the same value for the $\tau_{_T}$, i.e., the three-layer system relax thermally in the same way. Both assumptions are made, since up to our knowledge, there are not first-principles proposals for the values of this parameter, nor experimental measurements available in the literature. By varying $\tau_{_T}$, theoretical solutions for pressure can be adjusted to reproduce experimental results accurately; we have found that under this assumption if $\tau_{_T}$ is close to the laser pulse time $\tau_p$, acoustic multiple reflections are accurately reproduced in the frequency domain and, via Fast Fourier transforms, PA pulses are also reproduced accurately in the time domain.</description>
