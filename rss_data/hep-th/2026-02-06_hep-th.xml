      <title>Covariant Holographic Entropy Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic entropy cone classifies the possible entanglement structures of quantum states with a classical gravity dual. For static geometries, Bao et al. established that this cone is polyhedral by constructing a graph model from Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces on a time-symmetric slice. Extending this framework to general, time-dependent states governed by the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) formula has remained an open problem, as the relevant extremal surfaces do not lie on a common spatial slice. We resolve this by constructing a graph model directly from the causal structure of entanglement wedges. By proving a key "no-short-cut" theorem, we show that minimization over graph cuts reduces to a consideration of cuts corresponding to unions of complete HRT surfaces, establishing the equivalence of the covariant and static holographic entropy cones. Consequently, all foundational results, including polyhedrality and the finite nature of entropy inequalities, extend to general holographic states.</description>

      <title>Algebro-geometric bootstrapping from OPE decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture that decoupling relations in the operator product expansion of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) are encoded by an algebro-geometric object: a bifiltered affine scheme. We demonstrate how this scheme reproduces the Macdonald index (thus the Schur index) as well as the Higgs branch. Although the associated scheme typically admits continuous deformations, we find that a geometric extremization principle uniquely fixes these moduli, thereby providing a possible geometric route toward a classification of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Krylov complexity through quantum walks: An exploration of the quantum origins of complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Thermodynamic Ensembles, Euclidean Action and Legendre Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In thermodynamics, a Legendre transformation of the free energy provides a mapping between different statistical ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate that performing a Legendre transformation of the black hole on-shell action is equivalent to imposing different boundary conditions on the fields. Consequently, the choice of ensemble must be consistent with, and cannot contradict, the imposed boundary conditions. From this perspective, it follows that for four-dimensional dyonic black holes, the on-shell action can only be expressed either as a function of the electric charge and the magnetic potential, or alternatively as a function of the magnetic charge and the electric potential. Inspired by the Legendre transformation of the Maxwell field, we argue that for purely gravitational theories whose metric geometries admit a \(U(1)\) fiber bundle structure, i.e.\ rotating, boosted, or Kaluza-Klein monopole configurations, one can similarly introduce appropriate Legendre terms, in the sense of dimensional reduction, to modify the thermodynamic ensemble of the black hole. Within the dimensional reduction framework, we study the on-shell action of black holes in five-dimensional minimal supergravity with a Chern-Simons term, analyze the corresponding Legendre transformation procedure, and show how the resulting formulation remains consistent with the Wald formalism.</description>

      <title>Curvature divergences and gravity decoupling in Calabi--Yau rigid limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theories become rigid in gravity-decoupling limits. We study this effect for type II string compactifications on general Calabi--Yau manifolds, focusing on vector-multiplet trajectories whose endpoints exhibit axionic shift symmetries. This comprises field excursions of both finite- and infinite distance, but the latter display specific features due to the appearance of light towers of extremal BPS states, in agreement with Swampland principles. We show that vector multiplets split into two sets: those with gravitational and with rigid mutual interactions, and that only a subset of the latter -- dubbed core RFT -- can fully decouple from gravity. We characterise the core RFT in terms of the axionic shift symmetry, and derive decoupling criteria based on kinetic and Pauli interaction mixing. Our framework is illustrated in large complex structure, conifold-like, and Seiberg--Witten limits. In the last case, Pauli mixing obstructs decoupling whenever the dyonic and extremal BPS towers appear at the same scale. Across all these examples, the decoupling from gravity is signalled by a divergent moduli-space scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Improving 3d Ising OPE Coefficients with Fuzzy Sphere Conformal Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the $K$ special conformal generator in the Fuzzy sphere setup of the Ising CFT to determine primary states. For $\Delta \lesssim 8$, we recover the known primaries and find several new ones, including in the parity-odd sector. We then use these primaries to compute OPE coefficients. We find that using primaries constructed from special-$K$ allows for better extrapolation of OPE coefficients to the CFT limit, because of the existence of an $O(1)$ gap between primaries and descendants in the spectrum of eigenvalues of $|K|^2$ which protects the primaries from strongly mixing with descendants. We compare the CFT data we obtain with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Heavy Operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM: Integrated Correlators and AdS Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integrated correlation functions of half-BPS operators in $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) involving two superconformal primary operators in the stress-tensor multiplet and two identical maximal-trace operators of arbitrary $R$-charge $p$. Thanks to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM electro-magnetic duality these integrated correlators have recently been computed as exact functions of $N$, $p$, and of the Yang-Mills complexified coupling $\tau$. Using a combination of tools from ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral theory and resurgence analysis, we study the landscape of large-$N$ and/or large-charge expansions for these correlators. In particular, we find novel non-perturbative effects in the limit where $N\rightarrow \infty$ with $p/N^2$ fixed. From a holographic point of view this double-scaling regime is deeply connected with a second family of correlators which we analyse. Using the results for the maximal-trace operators, we derive an exact expression for a new integrated correlator involving two coherent-state operators, defined via an exponential generating function of multi-graviton states. At large-$N$ this correlator admits a holographic dual description in terms of a back-reacted geometry known as the AdS bubble. First, we show that the leading supergravity contribution to the integrated correlator agrees with a direct explicit integration of the correlator itself. Secondly, we derive predictions for the integrated version of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude evaluated on the AdS bubble background. Lastly, we demonstrate that the large-$N$ non-perturbative contributions to this integrated correlator emerge from giant-magnon configurations in the dual AdS bubble.</description>

      <title>Holographic pressure and volume for black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advocate for a holographic definition of thermodynamic pressure and volume for black holes based on quasi-local gravitational thermodynamics. When a black hole is enclosed by a finite timelike boundary, York's quasi-local first law includes a surface pressure conjugate to the boundary area. Assuming the existence of a holographically dual theory living on this boundary, these geometric quantities correspond to the pressure and volume of the dual thermal system. In this work we focus on static, spherically symmetric black holes, for which these quantities reduce to global thermodynamic variables. The holographic volume provides a notion of system size, allowing extensivity to be defined in standard thermodynamic terms, and it yields a definition of the large-system limit. For the asymptotically flat case, we show that, in the canonical thermodynamic representation, small Schwarzschild black holes are non-extensive, whereas large black holes become extensive in the large-system limit. A similar conclusion applies to Anti-de-Sitter Schwarzschild black holes, with the difference that the quasi-local energy of the large black hole also becomes extensive in the large-system limit. Before this limit, the energy decomposes into subextensive and extensive contributions, and we derive an explicit expression for the extensive part as a function of the finite volume and entropy.</description>

      <title>An introduction to string states and their interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject matter of these lecture notes is the open bosonic critical string, its perturbative spectrum and interactions. We begin with a brief review of classical string propagation, quantization, as well as the level-by-level construction of physical string states. We then review a new, covariant and efficient technology of constructing entire trajectories of infinitely many physical states deeper in the string spectrum. Finally, elements of the calculation of string scattering amplitudes, including aspects of the application of the technology for the efficient calculation of tree-level amplitudes of deeper trajectories, are also covered. The material is based on three invited lectures delivered by the author at the 2024 Modave Summer School in Mathematical Physics.</description>

      <title>Ersatz gravity and black-hole thermodynamics from Manin gauge theory with noncompact gauge group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a three-dimensional Manin gauge theory with gauge group $\operatorname{SL}(2;\mathbb R)$ (i.e. Yang-Mills theory, the third-way theory, or the imaginary third-way theory) minimally coupled to Einstein gravity admits a dual interpretation as Einstein gravity with an exotic coupling to a Manin gauge theory, where the roles of dreibein/spin connection and field strength/gauge potential are interchanged. The dual, or ersatz, gravitational metric $\hat g_{\mu\nu}\sim\operatorname{tr}((\star F)_\mu (\star F)_\nu)$ is a classical double copy of the gauge field strength $F_{\mu\nu}$ (as opposed to the usual double copy of the gauge potential $A_\mu$). If matter exclusively couples to $\hat g$ (for example, in a gravitational decoupling limit), then one can formulate black-hole thermodynamics with regards to the ersatz metric. In particular, a black-hole solution for the ersatz metric $\hat g_{\mu\nu}$ (made of Yang-Mills fields) radiates ersatz Hawking radiation and obeys the laws of black-hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards Worst-Case Guarantees with Scale-Aware Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks organize information according to the hierarchical, multi-scale structure of natural data. Methods to interpret model internals should be similarly scale-aware, explicitly tracking how features compose across resolutions and guaranteeing bounds on the influence of fine-grained structure that is discarded as irrelevant noise. We posit that the renormalisation framework from physics can meet this need by offering technical tools that can overcome limitations of current methods. Moreover, relevant work from adjacent fields has now matured to a point where scattered research threads can be synthesized into practical, theory-informed tools. To combine these threads in an AI safety context, we propose a unifying research agenda -- \emph{scale-aware interpretability} -- to develop formal machinery and interpretability tools that have robustness and faithfulness properties supported by statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Dimensional structure of thermodynamic topology in ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the thermodynamic topology framework to ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. By constructing the off-shell Helmholtz free energy and the associated vector field, black hole states are characterized as topological defects, and their phase structures are described through zero points, winding numbers, and asymptotic thermodynamic behavior. Analyses of the four- and five-dimensional cases highlight the differences between even- and odd-dimensional configurations, while representative higher-dimensional cases confirm that no additional topological classes or subclasses emerge. We find that only two thermodynamic topological structures appear: the standard class $W^{1+}$ for most configurations, and the distinct subclass $\tilde{W}^{1+}$ for odd-dimensional black holes with maximal rotations. These results establish a unified, dimension-independent classification scheme for ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>More on OTOCs and Chaos in Quantum Mechanics -- Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit thermal out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in single-particle quantum systems, focusing on magnetic billiards. Using the stadium billiard as a testbed, we compute the thermal OTOC $C_T(t) = -\langle [x(t), p]^2 \rangle_\beta$ and extract Lyapunov-like exponents $\lambda_L$ that quantify early-time growth. We map out $\lambda_L(T, B)$, revealing a crossover from quantum chaos to magnetic rigidity. In parallel, we compute an alternative OTOC built from guiding-center operators, which exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamics and no exponential growth. Our results offer a controlled framework for probing scrambling, temperature dependence, and the interplay of geometry and magnetic fields in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing cosmological correlators via dispersion: from cutting to dressing rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how cosmological correlators can be reconstructed by applying the momentum-space dispersion formula to their discontinuities, treating them as functions of momentum variables associated with the corresponding de Sitter Witten diagrams. We focus on conformally coupled and massless polynomial scalar interactions (both IR-divergent and IR-convergent), and consider tree-level de Sitter Witten diagrams. We explicitly utilize the single-cut discontinuity relations, or cutting rules, involving the cosmological correlators recently constructed in arXiv:2512.20720. For diagrams with multiple interaction vertices, we apply the dispersion formula by cutting all internal lines in the diagram one by one, successively, thereby allowing us to reconstruct the full correlator using only lower-point contact-level objects and their discontinuity data, up to contact diagram ambiguities. We also rediscover how the cosmological correlators on the late-time slice of de Sitter space can be obtained from flat-space Feynman diagrams via a set of dressing rules. Our starting point, being the cutting rules for the cosmological correlators, also emphasizes how basic principles, such as unitarity for in-in correlators, can lead us to the dressing rules, which were previously derived in literature following a different method.</description>

      <title>Bound States in Lee's Complex Ghost Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theories (QFTs) including fourth-derivative terms such as the Lee-Wick finite QED and quadratic gravity have a better ultra-violet behavior compared to standard theories with second-derivative ones, but the existence of ghost with negative norm endangers unitarity. Such a ghost in general acquires a pair of complex conjugate masses from radiative corrections whose features are concisely described by the so-called Lee model. Working with the canonical operator formalism of QFTs, we investigate the issue of bound states in the Lee model. We find that the bound states cannot be created from ghosts by contributions of a complex delta function, which is a complex generalization of the well-known Dirac delta function. Since the cause of unitarity violation in the Lee-Wick model is the existence of the complex delta function instead of the Dirac delta function, it is of interest to notice that the violation of the unitarity is also connected to the non-existence of bound states. Finally, the problem of amelioration of the unitarity in quadratic gravity is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Hidden simplicity in AdS spinning Mellin amplitudes via scaffolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover surprising hidden simplicity in Mellin amplitudes for tree-level AdS holographic correlators for spinning operators, such as AdS "gluons" and "gravitons" (spin 1 and 2). We define Mellin amplitudes with $n$ spinning operators via the so-called "scaffolding" of $2n$-scalar ones with specific projection operators for each spin state, which are rational functions of Mellin variables of $2n$ scalars generalizing flat-space scaffolding amplitudes. We classify possible three-point structures with spin 1 and 2 which take the same form as massive three-point amplitudes in flat space, and match with special solutions such as those extracted from 6-scalar ones in $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times S^3$ or $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times S^5$. Focusing on $\mathrm{AdS}_5$ gluons, we directly bootstrap spinning amplitudes in scaffolding form up to $n=6$ gluons (which amounts to $2n=12$ scalars) using factorizations, multi-linearity and flat-space limit. The results take a remarkably simple form in analogy with flat-space amplitudes, which can be constructed from familiar 3- and 4-vertices as well as propagators of massive spin-1 particles. Surprisingly, we find that vertices with any descendant levels are proportional to the primary ones with nice combinatorial coefficients, which makes manifest the correct flat-space limit in the simplest possible way.</description>

      <title>The resurgence of errors in the localization of $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a physical interpretation for the analytic continuation of the partition function of superconformal SU$(2)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory on the four-sphere to all values of the Yang-Mills coupling. We show that a well-motivated 2d construction associates two-dimensional unstable instantons to the 4d complex saddles which appear as singularities in the integrand of the supersymmetric localization expression. The construction is based on the chiral algebra subsector, and aligns with the alternative Higgs branch localization.</description>

      <title>The 2-Dimensional Dual of $\phi^4$ in AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the correlation functions of a conformally coupled $\phi^4$-interacting theory in AdS$_3$ and its dual CFT$_2$. The one-loop diagram is not expressible in terms of known transcendental functions, but is shown to be expressible as an infinite sum of previously well-studied tree-level diagrams, and we compute this sum using several number-theoretic conjectures. This enables us to extract recursively, the analytic expressions of anomalous dimensions of all dual double-trace operators. In the $s$-channel various consistency checks were performed against established bootstrap method, while our results in the $t$- and $u$-channel are not available in any previous literature to our knowledge.</description>

      <title>"It from Bit": The Hartle-Hawking state and quantum mechanics for de Sitter observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of alpha sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe. The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and does not carry any quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates classical ensemble data with the quantum mechanics experienced by bulk observers and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of "It from Bit". We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.</description>

      <title>Allowable Complex Black Holes in the Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral has proven remarkably effective in the quantum regime of black hole physics. In this work, we examine the applicability of the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion for admissible complex metrics in the context of the Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral. We find that, for the super-conformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with unequal angular momenta, the black hole saddle points violate the KSW criterion precisely where the statistical description of the index breaks down. The corresponding critical point coincides with a phase transition into two-component ``grey galaxy'' configurations in the micro-canonical ensemble.</description>

      <title>Holographic Aspects of Non-minimal $R^3 F^{(a)}_{\mu \alpha }F^{(a)\mu \alpha} $ Black Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a modified theory of gravity where the Einstein-Hilbert action, including a cosmological constant, is non-minimally coupled to a Yang-Mills field via an $R^3 F^{(a)}_{\mu \alpha }F^{(a)\mu \alpha}$ interaction term. We derive a black brane solution for this model, accurate to the first order in the coupling parameter. Using gauge/gravity duality techniques, we then compute two key holographic transport coefficients: the color non-abelian direct current (DC) conductivity and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. Our analysis reveals that both transport coefficients are modified by the non-minimal coupling, with the conductivity bound violated for positive $q_2$ and the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound for shear viscosity violated for negative $q_2$. In the limit where the non-minimal coupling vanishes, our results consistently reduce to those of the standard Yang-Mills Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black brane.</description>

      <title>Classification of Oppenheimer-Snyder Collapse: Singular, Bouncing, and Soft-Landing Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) gravitational collapse matched to a general static, spherically symmetric exterior spacetime. Unlike the Schwarzschild case, two new features can arise in black holes with two horizons: an apparent-horizon left vertex, a temporary minimum in the apparent-horizon radius during collapse, and a bounce, where the star surface stops collapsing at a nonzero radius and reverses into expansion. We identify the conditions that lead to these two features. For two-horizon exteriors, trapped-region consistency requires that the apparent-horizon turning point occurs no earlier than the surface crossing of the inner horizon. As a concrete example, the OS collapse of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) spacetime shows both effects. In contrast, regular black holes with de Sitter cores show neither: their collapse is smooth and monotonic, and the surface approaches the center only as the proper time goes to infinity. These results naturally classify the OS collapses into three categories: singular, which ends at the center in finite time; bouncing, which reverses at a finite radius; and soft-landing, which reaches the center only asymptotically. We argue that these features are consistent with Penrose's strong cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

      <title>Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Taming multiparty entanglement at measurement-induced phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) give rise to novel dynamical states of quantum matter realized by balancing unitary evolution and measurements. We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.</description>

      <title>Influence of spatial curvature in cosmological particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze cosmological particle production driven by spacetime expansion in the early universe for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies with positive, negative, and zero spatial curvature. We prioritize analytical results to gain a deeper understanding of curvature-induced effects. Specifically, for a conformally coupled scalar field, we model the inflationary epoch as an exact de Sitter phase followed by a transition to a static universe. Both instantaneous and smooth exits from inflation are considered, the latter being implemented via the adiabatic vacuum prescription. Starting from an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum, we derive the associated mode functions carefully adapted to each curvature sign. Using the Bogoliubov formalism, we non-perturbatively compute the number density of produced scalar particles. Our results demonstrate that spatial curvature significantly impacts the resulting particle spectra, particularly for light fields, where the deviation from the flat-space scenario is most prominent and can reach several orders of magnitude</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Dimensions: I. $\gamma$-Independent Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for computing universal (in Vogel's sense) quantum dimension formulae for universal multiplets whose associated $sl$, $so$, and $sp$ representations are nonzero. The method uses the relation between $sl$ and $so$ representations given by the vertical-sum operation, and the dual relation between $sl$ and $sp$ representations given by the horizontal-sum operation on the corresponding Young diagrams. The usual quantum dimensions of these three representations, together with subtleties related to the invariance of universal formulae under automorphisms of the $sl$ Dynkin diagram, allow one to determine the $\gamma$-independent factors of a universal quantum dimension (note that $\gamma$ is the only parameter for classical algebras, depending on their rank). Using this approach, we compute the $\gamma$-independent factors for (known) adjoints' universal quantum dimension, and also obtain such a factor in one new case. We discuss how to extend this approach to the $\gamma$-dependent factors in the quantum dimension formulae, and other issues. This is another instance in which calculations purely within the classical algebras predict the answers for the exceptional cases, due to the hidden universality structure of the theory of simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Simulating first-order phase transition during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ending the inflation by vacuum decay is considered infeasible due to the graceful exit problem. Even if considering an alternative field other than the inflaton to realize a first-order phase transition (FoPT) during inflation, it is usually challenging for concrete model building, as bubble nucleations might not be fast and dense enough to successfully end the inflation. In this work, we propose a FoPT at the grand-unification-theory (GUT) scale within the Starobinsky inflation. The key construction is an exponentially evolving potential barrier dynamically controlled by the rolling inflaton, so that almost no bubble is nucleated during the early inflationary era, but with massive bubble nucleations near the end of inflation. With lattice numerical simulations, we have successfully tested this GUT-FoPT during Starobinsky inflation, and the resulting gravitational-wave energy density spectrum reproduces previous analytical estimation with a distinctive oscillation feature at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Induced-Gravity Higgs Inflation in Palatini Supergravity Confronts ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate within Palatini Supergravity a model of induced-gravity inflation excellently consistent with ACT DR6. The inflaton belongs in the decomposition of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields which lead to the spontaneous breaking of a U(1)B-L symmetry at a scale close to the range (0.102-5.85)x10^16 GeV. The inflaton field is canonically normalized thanks to a real and shift-symmetric contribution into the Kaehler potential. It also includes two separate holomorphic and antiholomorphic logarithmic terms, the argument of which can be interpreted as the coupling of the inflaton to the Ricci scalar. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. Embedding the model in a B-L extension of the MSSM we show how the mu parameter can be generated and non-thermal leptogenesis can be successfully realized. An outcome of our scheme is split SUSY with gravitino mass in the range (40-60) PeV, which is consistent with the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass.</description>

Abstract: We study perturbations induced by a light particle scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole. Exploiting recent results for the wave propagation in this geometry, we derive the fields that this process induces on the horizon to leading order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) regime, when the light probe is far from the black hole. We then use these results to calculate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum that enter the black hole. We consider the effects due to gravitational, electromagnetic and scalar radiation, finding agreement with recent computations of the absorbed energy, while the absorbed angular momentum provides a new PM result.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Conformal Limit at Finite Density: Insights from Effective Models and Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss recent results obtained with the application of the medium separation scheme (MSS) in different contexts where a clear violation of the conformal limit for the speed of sound at finite density has been observed in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We analyze several scenarios, including QCD at finite isospin density, two-color QCD, and two-flavor color superconductivity. Whenever possible, we compare our findings with lattice QCD (LQCD) results, showing that the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model combined with the MSS provides a consistent description across different regimes of the QCD phase diagram. Our analysis highlights how effective models, when properly regularized, can capture essential nonperturbative features of dense QCD matter, offering complementary insights to lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Does Cosmology require Hermiticity in Quantum Mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of allowing non-Hermitian structures in quantum cosmology by extending the Wheeler DeWitt framework beyond strictly Hermitian dynamics. Using a controlled semiclassical reduction, we show how anti Hermitian contributions propagate into both early universe primordial fluctuations and late-time structure growth as effective damping or gain terms. Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history. We demonstrate that these bounds are mutually consistent between early and late-time probes and can be partially relaxed in theories beyond General Relativity. Our results establish cosmology as a novel arena for testing foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and suggest that Hermiticity may emerge dynamically along the semiclassical branch describing our universe.</description>

Abstract: We propose a renormalization group flow with emergent supersymmetry in two dimensions from a non-Lagrangian theory. The ultraviolet theory does not have supersymmetry while the infrared theory does. We constrain the flow both analytically and numerically (truncated conformal space approach).

      <title>Collective field theory of gauged multi-matrix models: Integrating out off-diagonal strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-matrix toy model with a BFSS-like interaction term using the collective field formalism. The main technical simplification is obtained by gauge-fixing first, and integrating out the off-diagonal elements, before changing to the collective field variable. We show that the resulting $(2+1)$-dimensional collective field action has novel features with respect to non-locality, and that we need to add a mass term to get a time-local potential. As is expected, one recovers the single matrix quantum mechanical collective field Hamiltonian in the proper limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the anomalous conformal dimensions of the symmetric orbifold under the $2$-cycle twisted sector deformation were calculated using the perturbed action of the supercharges. In particular, explicit and simple formulae for the dispersion relations of the torus magnons in the $w$-cycle twisted sector were derived for large $w$. In this paper we reproduce these results from a direct perturbed $2$-point function calculation. In the process we also develop techniques (and a Mathematica code) that allows one to do these calculations for arbitrary quarter BPS states at finite $w$.</description>

      <title>Laplacians in Various Dimensions and the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The species cutoff is a moduli-dependent quantity signaling the onset of quantum gravitational phenomena, whose form can be oftentimes determined from higher-derivative and higher-curvature corrections within low-energy gravitational EFTs. In this work, we point out that these Wilson coefficients are eigenfunctions of an appropriate second-order elliptic operator defined over moduli space in theories with more than four supercharges. This was already known to be the case for the leading $\mathcal{R}^4$-correction to the two-derivative (bosonic) action of maximal supergravity in $d\leq 10$. Here, we reconsider this fact from the Swampland point of view and show how, in $d=10,9,8$, solving a Laplace equation imposes non-trivial restrictions on the species hull vectors. We further argue that this property is also satisfied in settings with less supersymmetry. In particular, we focus on the $\mathcal{R}^4$-operator in minimal supergravity theories in $d=10,9$, and on the leading $\mathcal{R}^2$-term in setups with 8 supercharges in $d=6,5,4$. Finally, we provide a symmetry-based criterion for determining when the relevant elliptic operator should be the Laplacian. A bottom-up rationale for this constraint remains to be fully understood, and we conclude by outlining some compelling possibilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniqueness and rigidity of black holes remain central themes in gravitational research. In this work, we investigate the construction of all extremal black hole solutions to the Einstein equation for a given near-horizon geometry, employing the homotopy algebraic perspective, a powerful and increasingly influential framework in both classical and quantum field theory. Utilising Gau{\ss}ian null coordinates, we recast the deformation problem as an analysis of the homotopy Maurer-Cartan equation associated with an $L_\infty$-algebra. Through homological perturbation theory, we systematically solve this equation order by order in directions transverse to the near-horizon geometry. As a concrete application of this formalism, we examine the deformations of the extremal Kerr horizon. Notably, this homotopy-theoretic approach enables us to characterise the moduli space of deformations by studying only the lowest-order solutions, offering a systematic way to understand the landscape of extremal black hole geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define analytic maps between super Riemann surfaces which extend the notion of branched covering maps to a supersymmetric setting. We show that these super covering maps appear naturally both in symmetric product orbifolds of superconformal field theories, as well as in the hybrid formalism for tensionless string theory on $\text{AdS}_3\times S^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$. In the former, they can be used to calculate correlators in a manifestly supersymmetric way, while in the latter they solve Ward identities of correlators with spacetime supersymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the pseudo-entropy program, we study timelike subregion complexity within the holographic Complexity-equal-Volume framework, extending previous spatial constructions to Lorentzian boundary intervals. For hyperbolic timelike regions in pure AdS, we compute the enclosed bulk volume and show that, despite the Lorentzian embedding, the resulting complexity is purely real. We generalize the analysis to AdS black brane geometries, where extremal surfaces may either remain entirely outside the horizon or penetrate it, placing their timelike branch inside the black brane interior. In both configurations, the complexity exhibits the same universal UV divergences as the spacelike case, yet it receives no imaginary contribution, highlighting its causal and geometric origin. This reality stands in sharp contrast to the complex-valued pseudo-entropy and indicates that holographic complexity retains a genuinely geometric, real character even under Lorentzian continuation.</description>

      <title>Diagonal boundary conditions in critical loop models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to Monge-Ampere geometry based on techniques from higher symplectic geometry. Our work is motivated by the application of Monge-Ampere geometry to the Poisson equation for the pressure that arises for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Whilst this equation constitutes an elliptic problem for the pressure, it can also be viewed as a non-linear partial differential equation connecting the pressure, the vorticity, and the rate-of-strain. As such, it is a key diagnostic relation in the quest to understand the formation of vortices in turbulent flows. We study this equation via an associated (higher) Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle to the configuration space of the fluid. Using our definition of a (higher) Monge-Ampere structure, we study an associated metric on the cotangent bundle together with its pull-back to the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold. The signatures of these metrics are dictated by the relationship between vorticity and rate-of-strain, and their scalar curvatures can be interpreted in a physical context in terms of the accumulation of vorticity, strain, and their gradients. We show explicity, in the case of two-dimensional flows, how topological information can be derived from the Monge-Ampere geometry of the Lagrangian submanifold. We also demonstrate how certain solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, such as Hill's spherical vortex and an integrable case of Arnol'd-Beltrami-Childress flow, have symmetries that facilitate a formulation of these solutions from the perspective of (higher) symplectic reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting an experiment in a low Earth orbit spacecraft and using the Earth a spin and mass source to constrain beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) long-range spin- and velocity-dependent interactions, which are mediated by the exchange of an ultralight $\left(m_{Z^{\prime}}&lt;10^{-10}\text{eV}\right)$ or massless intermediate vector boson. The high speed of the low Earth orbit spacecraft can enhance the sensitivity to velocity-dependent interactions. The periodicity enables efficient extraction of signals from background noise, thereby improving the experiment's accuracy. Combining these advantages, we demonstrate theoretically that the novel Spacecraft-Earth model can improve existing bounds on these exotic interactions by up to three orders of magnitude, using the China Space Station (CSS) as a representative low-Earth-orbit carrier. Such a model, if successfully implemented, may provide an innovative strategy for detecting ultralight dark matter and yield tighter constraints on certain coupling constants of exotic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the non-dissipative, parity-odd spin transport of $(2+1)$-dimensional relativistic electrons, generated by torsion, and the torsional Hall viscosity $\zeta_{\rm H}$. We first determine $\zeta_{\rm H}$ for massive Dirac fermions in the presence of a constant electromagnetic field. We predict that the magnetic field induces a contribution to $\zeta_{\rm H}$ competing with the one originating from the Dirac mass. Moreover, we quantify the impact on $\zeta_{\rm H}$ originating from the band structure deformation quadratic in momentum terms that was proposed by Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ). We find that the BHZ deformation substantially enhances $\zeta_{\rm H}$ in magnitude as measured in a domain wall configuration, when compared to the free Dirac fermion result. Nevertheless, the torsional Hall viscosity still discriminates between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes. Our results, hence, pave the way for a deeper understanding of hydrodynamic spin transport and its possible verification in experiments.</description>

      <title>Gauge Dependence of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations: Analytical Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM), uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT) gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\eta^n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an operator generalization of the Li-Haldane conjecture regarding the entanglement Hamiltonian of a disk in a 2+1D chiral gapped groundstate. The logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also define a quantity $(\mathfrak{c}_{\text{tot}})_{\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory. Our formalism also gives an explanation of the modular commutator formula for the chiral central charge.</description>

Abstract: Misalignment dynamics, the non-equilibrium evolution of a scalar (or pseudoscalar) condensate in a potential landscape, broadly describes a solution to the strong CP problem, a mechanism for cold dark matter production and (pre) reheating post inflation. Often, radiative corrections are included phenomenologically by replacing the potential by the effective potential which is a \emph{static quantity}, its usefulness is restricted to (near) equilibrium situations. We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\infty)\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy. Subtle aspects of renormalization associated with the initial value problem are analyzed and resolved. Possible new manifestations of asymptotic spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as a consequence of the dynamics even in absence of tree level (SSB), and cosmological inferences are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We develop a current-based construction of generalized symmetries in $(3+1)$D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), focusing on intrinsically non-invertible higher-form symmetries and their mixed anomalies. Starting from the equations of motion, we extract conserved currents and exponentiate the corresponding charges to obtain topological symmetry operators. This gives a step-by-step procedure for constructing symmetry operators, fusion, and anomaly diagnostics directly from the continuum action. We focus on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a\wedge a\wedge b$ twist, where $a$'s and $b$ are 1-form and 2-form gauge fields, respectively. These theories realize non-Abelian $(3+1)$D TQFTs supporting Borromean-rings braiding and describe three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in condensed matter. For $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$, a microscopic realization is given by the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double model. Two distinct classes of conserved currents emerge: Type-I currents generate invertible higher-form symmetries with group-like fusion, while Type-II currents require additional consistency conditions on gauge-field configurations, leading to intrinsically non-invertible symmetries dressed by projectors. We compute the fusion algebra: invertible operators admit inverses, while non-invertible ones exhibit multi-channel fusion governed by projector fusion. We diagnose mixed anomalies by coupling multiple conserved currents to background gauge fields, revealing two outcomes: anomalies canceled by anomaly inflow from a higher-dimensional theory, and intrinsic gauging obstructions encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum theory. Overall, our results provide a unified and practical approach for constructing and characterizing higher-form symmetries, which can be extended to more general TQFTs and topological orders.</description>
