      <title>Visualization for physics analysis improvement and applications in BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern particle physics experiments usually rely on highly complex and large-scale spectrometer devices. In high energy physics experiments, visualization helps detector design, data quality monitoring, offline data processing, and has great potential for improving physics analysis. In addition to the traditional physics data analysis based on statistical methods, visualization provides unique intuitive advantages in searching for rare signal events and reducing background noises. By applying the event display tool to several physics analyses in the BESIII experiment, we demonstrate that visualization can benefit potential physics discovery and improve the signal significance. With the development of modern visualization techniques, it is expected to play a more important role in future data processing and physics analysis of particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Complete Optimal Non-Resonant Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first-ever complete, model-agnostic search strategy based on the optimal anomaly score, for new physics on the tails of distributions. Signal sensitivity is achieved via a classifier trained on auxiliary features in a weakly-supervised fashion, and backgrounds are predicted using the ABCD method in the classifier output and the primary tail feature. The independence between the classifier output and the tail feature required for ABCD is achieved by first training a conditional normalizing flow that yields a decorrelated version of the auxiliary features; the classifier is then trained on these features. Both the signal sensitivity and background prediction require a sample of events accurately approximating the SM background; we assume this can be furnished by closely related control processes in the data or by accurate simulations, as is the case in countless conventional analyses. The viability of our approach is demonstrated for signatures consisting of (mono)jets and missing transverse energy, where the main SM background is $Z(\nu \nu) +\text{jets}$, and the data-driven control process is $\gamma+\text{jets}$.</description>

      <title>Implementation of implicit filter for spatial spectra extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale analysis based on coarse-graining has been proposed recently as an alternative to Fourier analysis. It is now broadly used to analyze energy spectra and energy transfers in eddy-resolving ocean simulations. However, for data from unstructured-mesh models it requires interpolation to a regular grid. We present a high-performance Python implementation of an alternative coarse-graining method which relies on implicit filters using discrete Laplacians. This method can work on arbitrary (structured or unstructured) meshes and is applicable to the direct output of unstructured-mesh ocean circulation atmosphere models. The computation is split into two phases: preparation and solving. The first one is specific only to the mesh. This allows for auxiliary arrays that are then computed to be reused, significantly reducing the computation time. The second part consists of sparse matrix algebra and solving linear system. Our implementation is accelerated by GPUs to achieve unmatched performance and scalability. This results in processing data based on meshes with more than 10M surface vertices in a matter of seconds. As an illustration, the method is applied to compute spatial spectra of ocean currents from high-resolution FESOM2 simulations.</description>

      <title>Mini-jet Clustering Algorithm Using Transverse-momentum Seeds in High-energy Nuclear Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to detect mini-jet clusters in high-energy nuclear collisions, by selecting a high-transverse-momentum ($p_T$) particle as a seed and assigning a clustering radius ($R$) in the pseudorapidity and azimuthal-angle space. Our PYTHIA simulations for $p$+$p$ collisions show that a scheme with a seeding $p_T$ of around 0.5 GeV/$c$ and $R$ of approximately 0.6 satisfactorily identifies mini-jet clusters. The correlation between clusters obtained in PYTHIA calculations using the algorithm exhibits the proper behavior of hard-scattering-like processes, suggesting its usefulness in isolating mini-jet-like clusters from non-hard-scattering soft processes when applied to actual nuclear-collision data, thereby allowing a closer examination of both the mini-jet and the soft mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Testing structural balance theories in heterogeneous signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07023v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundance of data about social relationships allows the human behavior to be analyzed as any other natural phenomenon. Here we focus on balance theory, stating that social actors tend to avoid establishing cycles with an odd number of negative links. This statement, however, can be supported only after a comparison with a benchmark. Since the existing ones disregard actors' heterogeneity, we extend Exponential Random Graphs to signed networks with both global and local constraints and employ them to assess the significance of empirical unbalanced patterns. We find that the nature of balance crucially depends on the null model: while homogeneous benchmarks favor the weak balance theory, according to which only triangles with one negative link should be under-represented, heterogeneous benchmarks favor the strong balance theory, according to which also triangles with all negative links should be under-represented. Biological networks, instead, display strong frustration under any benchmark, confirming that structural balance inherently characterizes social networks.</description>
