      <title>Latroids and code invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latroids were introduced by Vertigan, who associated a latroid to a linear block code and showed that its Tutte polynomial determines the weight enumerator of the code. We associate a latroid to a code over a ring or a field endowed with a general support function, and show that the generalized weights of the code can be recovered from the associated latroid. This provides a uniform framework for studying generalized weights of linear block codes, linear codes over a ring, rank-metric and sum-rank metric codes. Under suitable assumptions, we show that the latroid determines the weight distribution of the code.</description>

      <title>MIMO-PASS: Uplink and Downlink Transmission via MIMO Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) are a recent flexible-antenna technology that is realized by attaching simple components, referred to as pinching elements, to dielectric waveguides. This work explores the potential of deploying PASS for uplink and downlink transmission in multiuser MIMO settings. For downlink PASS-aided communication, we formulate the optimal hybrid beamforming, in which the digital precoding matrix at the access point and the location of pinching elements on the waveguides are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable weighted sum-rate. Invoking fractional programming and Gauss-Seidel approach, we propose two low-complexity algorithms to iteratively update the precoding matrix and activated locations of the pinching elements. We further study uplink transmission aided by a PASS, where an iterative scheme is designed to address the underlying hybrid multiuser detection problem. We validate the proposed schemes through extensive numerical experiments. The results demonstrate that using a PASS, the throughput in both uplink and downlink is boosted significantly as compared with baseline MIMO architectures, such as massive MIMO~and classical hybrid analog-digital designs. This highlights the great potential of PASSs, making it a promising reconfigurable antenna technology for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Sensing Rate Optimization for Multi-Band Cooperative ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the key technologies for future wireless networks, which potentially need to operate in multiple frequency bands to satisfy ever-increasing demands for both communication and sensing services. Motivated by this, we consider the sum sensing rate (SR) optimization for a cooperative ISAC system with linear precoding, where each base station (BS) works in a different frequency band. With this aim, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the semi-definite rank relaxation that introduces covariance matrices as optimization variables, and we apply the inner approximation (IA) method to deal with the nonconvexity of the resulting problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm increases the SR by approximately 25 % and 40 % compared to the case of equal power distribution in a cooperative ISAC system with two and three BSs, respectively. Additionally, the algorithm converges in only a few iterations, while its most optimal implementation scenario is in the low power regime.</description>

      <title>Linear Codes Derived from the Structure of Unit Graphs Over $\mathbb{Z}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the unit graph $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $, where $ n $ is of the form $n = p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \dots p_r^{n_r}$, with $ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_r $ being distinct prime numbers and $ n_1, n_2, \dots, n_r $ being positive integers. We establish the connectivity of $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $, show that its diameter is at most three, and analyze its edge connectivity. Furthermore, we construct $ q $-ary linear codes from the incidence matrix of $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $, explicitly determining their parameters and duals. A primary contribution of this work is the resolution of two conjectures from \cite{Jain2023} concerning the structural and coding-theoretic properties of $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $. These results extend the study of algebraic graph structures and highlight the interplay between number theory, graph theory, and coding theory.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-Target Multi-User ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams Are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.</description>

      <title>Constrained Gaussian Wasserstein Optimal Transport with Commutative Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport has found widespread applications in signal processing and machine learning. Among its many equivalent formulations, optimal transport seeks to reconstruct a random variable/vector with a prescribed distribution at the destination while minimizing the expected distortion relative to a given random variable/vector at the source. However, in practice, certain constraints may render the optimal transport plan infeasible. In this work, we consider three types of constraints: rate constraints, dimension constraints, and channel constraints, motivated by perception-aware lossy compression, generative principal component analysis, and deep joint source-channel coding, respectively. Special attenion is given to the setting termed Gaussian Wasserstein optimal transport, where both the source and reconstruction variables are multivariate Gaussian, and the end-to-end distortion is measured by the mean squared error. We derive explicit results for the minimum achievable mean squared error under the three aforementioned constraints when the covariance matrices of the source and reconstruction variables commute.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit for Hybrid Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20373v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems with different particle species are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian learning in hybrid spin-boson systems can achieve the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown hybrid Hamiltonian system, our algorithm can estimate the Hamiltonian coupling parameters up to root mean square error (RMSE) $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time scaling as $T \sim \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only $\mathcal{O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. Furthermore, it remains robust against small state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. In addition, we also provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the maximum evolution time per measurement. To validate our method, we apply it to the generalized Dicke model for Hamiltonian learning and the spin-boson model for spectrum learning, demonstrating its efficiency in practical quantum systems. These results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision quantum sensing and Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Generalization of Deep Reinforcement Learning With Application to Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a key machine learning technology driving progress across various scientific and engineering fields, including wireless communication. However, its limited interpretability and generalizability remain major challenges. In supervised learning, generalizability is commonly evaluated through the generalization error using information-theoretic methods. In DRL, the training data is sequential and not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), rendering traditional information-theoretic methods unsuitable for generalizability analysis. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel analytical method for evaluating the generalizability of DRL. Specifically, we first model the evolution of states and actions in trained DRL algorithms as unknown discrete, stochastic, and nonlinear dynamical functions. Then, we employ a data-driven identification method, the Koopman operator, to approximate these functions, and propose two interpretable representations. Based on these interpretable representations, we develop a rigorous mathematical approach to evaluate the generalizability of DRL algorithms. This approach is formulated using the spectral feature analysis of the Koopman operator, leveraging the H_\infty norm. Finally, we apply this generalization analysis to compare the soft actor-critic method, widely recognized as a robust DRL approach, against the proximal policy optimization algorithm for an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted mmWave wireless communication scenario.</description>

      <title>Configurational Information Measures, Phase Transitions, and an Upper Bound on Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Configurational entropy (CE) and configurational complexity (CC) are recently popularized information theoretic measures used to study the stability of solitons. This paper examines their behavior for 2D and 3D lattice Ising Models, where the quasi-stability of fluctuating domains is controlled by proximity to the critical temperature. Scaling analysis lends support to an unproven conjecture that these configurational information measures (CIMs) can detect (in)stability in field theories. The primary results herein are the derivation of a model dependent CC-CE relationship, as well as a model independent upper bound on CC. CIM phenomenology in the Ising universality class reveals multiple avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Information Theory Strikes Back: New Development in the Theory of Cardinality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the cardinality of the output of a query is a fundamental problem in database query processing.
  In this article, we overview a recently published contribution that casts the cardinality estimation problem as linear optimization and computes guaranteed upper bounds on the cardinality of the output for any full conjunctive query. The objective of the linear program is to maximize the joint entropy of the query variables and its constraints are the Shannon information inequalities and new information inequalities involving $\ell_p$-norms of the degree sequences of the join attributes.
  The bounds based on arbitrary norms can be asymptotically lower than those based on the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ norms, which capture the cardinalities and respectively the max-degrees of the input relations. They come with a matching query evaluation algorithm, are computable in exponential time in the query size, and are provably tight when each degree sequence is on one join attribute.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Hybrid Active and Passive Multiple Access via Slotted ALOHA-Driven Backscatter Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional backscatter communication (BackCom) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) are generally adopted for multiuser backscattering due to their simplicity in implementation. However, as the number of backscatter devices (BDs) proliferates, there will be a high overhead under the traditional centralized control techniques, and the inter-user coordination is unaffordable for the passive BDs, which are of scarce concern in existing works and remain unsolved. To this end, in this paper, we propose a slotted ALOHA-based random access for BackCom systems, in which each BD is randomly chosen and is allowed to coexist with one active device for hybrid multiple access. To excavate and evaluate the performance, a resource allocation problem for max-min transmission rate is formulated, where transmit antenna selection, receive beamforming design, reflection coefficient adjustment, power control, and access probability determination are jointly considered. To deal with this intractable problem, we first transform the objective function with the max-min form into an equivalent linear one, and then decompose the resulting problem into three sub-problems. Next, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based greedy algorithm with a penalty function, successive convex approximation, and linear programming are designed to obtain sub-optimal solutions for tractable analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of transmission rate and fairness.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Limits of Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bistatic sensing refers to scenarios where the transmitter (illuminating the target) and the sensing receiver (estimating the target state) are physically separated, in contrast to monostatic sensing, where both functions are co-located. In practical settings, bistatic sensing may be required either due to inherent system constraints or as a means to mitigate the strong self-interference encountered in monostatic configurations. A key practical challenge in bistatic radio-frequency radar systems is the synchronization and calibration of the separate transmitter and sensing receiver. In this paper, we are not concerned with these signal processing aspects and take a complementary information-theoretic perspective on bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Namely, we aim to characterize the capacity-distortion function-the fundamental tradeoff between communication capacity and sensing accuracy. We consider a general discrete channel model for a bistatic ISAC system and derive a multi-letter representation of its capacity-distortion function. Then, we establish single-letter upper and lower bounds and provide exact single-letter characterizations for degraded bistatic ISAC channels. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a bistatic ISAC broadcast channel and derive the capacity-distortion region with a single-letter characterization in the degraded case. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results, highlighting the benefits of ISAC over separate communication and sensing, as well as the role of leveraging communication to assist sensing in bistatic systems.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Loveland betting strategies lose the Betting game on open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness (KLR) is the same as Martin-L\"of randomness (MLR) is a major open problem in the study of algorithmic randomness. More general classes of betting strategies than Kolmogorov-Loveland ones have been studied in \cite{MMS, Rute, TP}. In each case it was proven that the class induces a notion of randomness equivalent to MLR. In all of those proofs, it was shown that the class contains a finite set of betting strategies such that for any given bound, when betting on a binary sequence contained in an effective open set of small enough measure, at least one of the betting strategies in the set earns capital larger than the bound. We show that the class of Kolmogorov-Loveland betting strategies does not have this property.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic codes over serial rings and their annihilator CSS construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the algebraic structure for polycyclic codes over a specific class of serial rings, defined as $\mathscr R=R[x_1,\ldots, x_s]/\langle t_1(x_1),\ldots, t_s(x_s) \rangle$, where $R$ is a chain ring and each $t_i(x_i)$ in $R[x_i]$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots, s\}$ is a monic square-free polynomial. We define quasi-$s$-dimensional polycyclic codes and establish an $R$-isomorphism between these codes and polycyclic codes over $\mathscr R$. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of annihilator self-dual, annihilator self-orthogonal, annihilator linear complementary dual, and annihilator dual-containing polycyclic codes over this class of rings. We also establish the CSS construction for annihilator dual-preserving polycyclic codes over the chain ring $R$ and use this construction to derive quantum codes from polycyclic codes over $\mathscr{R}$.</description>

Abstract: Along with the prosperity of generative artificial intelligence (AI), its potential for solving conventional challenges in wireless communications has also surfaced. Inspired by this trend, we investigate the application of the advanced diffusion models (DMs), a representative class of generative AI models, to high dimensional wireless channel estimation. By capturing the structure of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels via a deep generative prior encoded by DMs, we develop a novel posterior inference method for channel reconstruction. We further adapt the proposed method to recover channel information from low-resolution quantized measurements. Additionally, to enhance the over-the-air viability, we integrate the DM with the unsupervised Stein's unbiased risk estimator to enable learning from noisy observations and circumvent the requirements for ground truth channel data that is hardly available in practice. Results reveal that the proposed estimator achieves high-fidelity channel recovery while reducing estimation latency by a factor of 10 compared to state-of-the-art schemes, facilitating real-time implementation. Moreover, our method outperforms existing estimators while reducing the pilot overhead by half, showcasing its scalability to ultra-massive antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Error Correction Code Transformer: From Non-Unified to Unified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel coding is vital for reliable data transmission in modern wireless systems, and its significance will increase with the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks, which will need to support various error correction codes. However, traditional decoders were typically designed as fixed hardware circuits tailored to specific decoding algorithms, leading to inefficiencies and limited flexibility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, code-agnostic Transformer-based decoding architecture capable of handling multiple linear block codes, including Polar, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC), and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH), within a single framework. To achieve this, standardized units are employed to harmonize parameters across different code types, while the redesigned unified attention module compresses the structural information of various codewords. Additionally, a sparse mask, derived from the sparsity of the parity-check matrix, is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture inherent constraints between information and parity-check bits, resulting in improved decoding accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified Transformer-based decoder not only outperforms existing methods but also provides a flexible, efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Minimum Data Rate Maximization for Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses, for the first time, the uplink performance optimization of multi-user pinching-antenna (PA) systems, recently developed for next-generation wireless networks. By leveraging the unique capabilities of PAs to dynamically configure wireless channels, we focus on maximizing the minimum achievable data rate between devices to achieve a balanced trade-off between throughput and fairness. An effective approach is proposed that separately optimizes the positions of the PAs and the resource allocation. The antenna positioning problem is reformulated into a convex one, while a closed-form solution is provided for the resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the investigated system using the proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts, emphasizing the significant potential of PA systems for robust and efficient uplink communication in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication with Flexible Reflector: Joint Placement and Rotation Optimization for Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive metal reflectors for communication enhancement have appealing advantages such as ultra low cost, zero energy expenditure, maintenance-free operation, long life span, and full compatibility with legacy wireless systems. To unleash the full potential of passive reflectors for wireless communications, this paper proposes a new passive reflector architecture, termed flexible reflector (FR), for enabling the flexible adjustment of beamforming direction via the FR placement and rotation optimization. We consider the multi-FR aided area coverage enhancement and aim to maximize the minimum expected receive power over all locations within the target coverage area, by jointly optimizing the placement positions and rotation angles of multiple FRs. To gain useful insights, the special case of movable reflector (MR) with fixed rotation is first studied to maximize the expected receive power at a target location, where the optimal single-MR placement positions for electrically large and small reflectors are derived in closed-form, respectively. It is shown that the reflector should be placed at the specular reflection point for electrically large reflector. While for area coverage enhancement, the optimal placement is obtained for the single-MR case and a sequential placement algorithm is proposed for the multi-MR case. Moreover, for the general case of FR, joint placement and rotation design is considered for the single-/multi-FR aided coverage enhancement, respectively. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate significant performance gains of FRs over various benchmark schemes under different practical setups in terms of receive power enhancement.</description>

      <title>Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.</description>
