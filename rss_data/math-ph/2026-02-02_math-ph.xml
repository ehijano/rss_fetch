      <title>Mermin-Wagner theorems for quantum systems with multipole symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Mermin-Wagner-type theorems for quantum lattice systems in the presence of multipole symmetries. These theorems show that the presence of higher-order symmetries protects against the breaking of lower-order ones. In particular, we prove that the critical dimension in which the charge symmetry can be broken increases if the system admits higher multipole symmetries, e.g. $ d = 4 $ on the regular lattice $ \mathbb{Z}^d $ in the presence of dipole symmetry.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantization by Paths, Part III: The Metaplectic Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous parts of this work, we established the Prequantum Groupoid $\mathbf{T}_\omega$ as the universal geometric container for quantum mechanics. This approach, which we call the "Geometric Quantization by Paths" (GQbP) framework, replaces the traditional construction of principal bundles with the distillation of the space of histories. In this third part, we cross the "Threshold of Analysis" by constructing the intrinsic observable algebra of the system. The harmonic oscillator is treated here as a validation case, demonstrating that the standard resolution via complex polarization and half-forms is naturally integrated into the GQbP framework. Starting from the complexified groupoid, we define the algebra using symplectic half-densities to ensure a canonical convolution product. We then show that the transition to a polarized representation forces a factorization of these densities. The action of the symmetry group on the polarized half-forms generates a divergence term, which we identify as the source of the zero-point energy of the harmonic oscillator, $E_0 = n\hbar/2$. This derivation resolves the "Metaplectic Anomaly" as a necessary geometric consequence of the intrinsic quantization process.</description>

      <title>The metaplectic semigroup and its applications to time-frequency analysis and evolution operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic analysis of the metaplectic semigroup $\mathrm{Mp}_+(d,\mathbb{C})$ associated with positive complex symplectic matrices, a notion introduced almost simultaneously and independently by H\"ormander, Brunet, Kramer, and Howe, thereby extending the classical metaplectic theory beyond the unitary setting.
  While the existing literature has largely focused on propagators of quadratic evolution equations, for which results are typically obtained via Mehler formulas, our approach is operator-theoretic and symplectic in spirit and adapts techniques from the standard metaplectic group $\mathrm{Mp}(d,\mathbb{R})$ to a substantially broader framework that is not driven by differential problems or particular propagators.
  This point of view provides deeper insight into the structure of the metaplectic semigroup, and allows us to investigate its generators, polar decomposition, and intertwining relations with complex conjugation and with the Wigner distribution. We then exploit these structural results to characterize, from a metaplectic perspective, classes of time-frequency representations satisfying prescribed structural properties. Finally, we discuss further implications for parabolic equations with complex quadratic Hamiltonians, we study the boundedness of their propagators on modulation spaces, we obtain estimates in time of their operator norms. Finally, we apply our theory to the study of propagation of Wigner singularities.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning of logical noise from syndrome data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing errors in quantum circuits is essential for device calibration, yet detecting rare error events requires a large number of samples. This challenge is particularly severe in calibrating fault-tolerant, error-corrected circuits, where logical error probabilities are suppressed to higher order relative to physical noise and are therefore difficult to calibrate through direct logical measurements. Recently, Wagner et al. [PRL 130, 200601 (2023)] showed that, for phenomenological Pauli noise models, the logical channel can instead be inferred from syndrome measurement data generated during error correction. Here, we extend this framework to realistic circuit-level noise models. From a unified code-theoretic perspective and spacetime code formalism, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the logical channel from syndrome data alone and explicitly characterize the learnable degrees of freedom of circuit-level Pauli faults. Using Fourier analysis and compressed sensing, we develop efficient estimators with provable guarantees on sample complexity and computational cost. We further present an end-to-end protocol and demonstrate its performance on several syndrome-extraction circuits, achieving orders-of-magnitude sample-complexity savings over direct logical benchmarking. Our results establish syndrome-based learning as a practical approach to characterizing the logical channel in fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum bootstrap product codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product constructions constitute a powerful method for generating quantum CSS codes, yielding celebrated examples such as toric codes and asymptotically good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the problem of the spin quantum Hall transition on random networks using a mapping to classical percolation that focuses on the boundary of percolating clusters. Using tools of two-dimensional quantum gravity, we compute critical exponents that characterize this transition and confirm that these are related to the exponents for the regular (square) network through the KPZ relation. Our results demonstrate the relevance of the geometric randomness of the networks and support conclusions of numerical simulations of random networks for the integer quantum Hall transition.</description>

      <title>Geometric Selection Rules for Singularity Formation in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the polynomial degeneracies of curvature invariants can act as geometric selection rules for spacetime singularities in modified theories of gravity. The degeneracies arise purely from the algebraic structure of Riemannian geometry and impose non-trivial constraints on the effective energy-momentum tensor. We derive these constraints for metric $f(R)$ gravity and a wide class of scalar-tensor theories to show that a singularity formation is generally occluded by curvature and/or scalar-induced anisotropies. Therefore, formation of a singularity in modified theories of gravity is not always a generic outcome but can occur only along algebraically admissible branches selected by Riemannian curvature invariants.</description>

      <title>Uncoupled Dirac-Yang-Mills Pairs on Closed Riemannian Spin Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirac-Yang-Mills equations on closed spin manifolds with a focus on uncoupled solutions, i.e. solutions for which the connection form satisfies the Yang-Mills equation. Such solutions require the Dirac current, a quadratic form on the spinor bundle, to vanish. We study the condition that this current vanishes on all harmonic spinors using perturbation theory and obtain a classification of the connection forms for which this holds, which we show contains an open and dense subset of connections. This has several implications for the generic dimension of the kernel of the Dirac operator. We further establish existence results for uncoupled solutions, in particular in dimension $4$ using the index theorem. Finally we generalize a construction method for twisted harmonic spinors to construct explicit uncoupled solutions on $4$-manifolds admitting twistor spinors and on spin manifolds of any dimension admitting parallel spinors.</description>

      <title>On two-dimensional Dirac operators with critical delta-shell interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Dirac operators with singular interactions of electrostatic and Lorentzscalar type, supported either on a straight line or a circle. For certain critical values of the interaction strengths, the essential spectrum of such operators comprises an isolated point lying within the mass gap. We clarify the nature of this point in both geometries. For the straight line model, this point is known to be an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity, and we provide a detailed analysis of the corresponding eigenfunctions. By contrast, in the case of a circle, we show that the said point is not itself an eigenvalue, but rather an accumulation point of a double sequence of simple eigenvalues. In view of the high degree of symmetry of the configurations under analysis, this behavior is unexpected and our findings lead us to formulate some conjectures concerning critical singular interactions supported on generic smooth curves.</description>

Abstract: We show how various constructions of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie superalgebras are related to each other. These Lie superalgebras have a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ as the subalgebra at degree 0, an odd $\mathfrak{g}$-module V as the subspace at degree 1, and an embedding tensor as an element at degree -1. This is a linear map from V to $\mathfrak{g}$ satisfying a quadratic constraint, which equips V with the structure of a Leibniz algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we shall investigate the Nonlinear Magnetic Schr\"odinger Equation on noncompact metric graphs, focusing on the existence of ground states. We prove that the magnetic Hamiltonian is variationally equivalent to a non-magnetic operator with additional repulsive potentials supported on the graph's cycles. This effective potential is strictly determined by the Aharonov-Bohm flux through the topological loops. Leveraging this reduction, we extend classical existence criteria to the magnetic setting. As a key application, we characterize the ground state structure on the tadpole graph, revealing a mass-dependent phase transition. The ground states exist for sufficiently small repulsion in an intermediate regime of masses while sufficiently strong flux prevents the formation of ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new causal spinfoam vertex for $4$d Lorentzian quantum gravity. The causal data are encoded in Toller $T$-matrices, which add to Wigner $D$-matrices $T^{(+)}+T^{(-)}=D$, and for which we provide a Feynman $\mathrm{i}\varepsilon$ representation. We discuss how the Toller poles cancel in the EPRL vertex, how the Livine-Oriti model is obtained in the Barrett-Crane limit, and how spinfoam causal data are distinct from Regge causal data. In the large-spin limit, we show that only Lorentzian Regge geometries with causal data compatible with the spinfoam data are selected, resulting in a single exponential $\exp(+\mathrm{i}\, S_{\mathrm{Regge}}/\hbar)$ and a new form of causal rigidity.</description>

      <title>Interacting dynamical systems on networks and fractals: discrete and continuous models, mean-field limit, and convergence rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a continuum limit and mean-field theory for interacting particle systems (IPS) on self-similar networks, a new class of discrete models whose large-scale behavior gives rise to nonlocal evolution equations on fractal domains. This work extends the graphon-based framework for IPS, used to derive continuum and mean-field limits in the non-exchangeable setting, to situations where the spatial domain is fractal rather than Euclidean. The motivation arises from both physical models naturally formulated on fractals and real-world networks exhibiting hierarchical or quasi-self-similar structure.
  Our analysis relies on tools from fractal geometry, including Iterated Function Systems and self-similar measures. A central result is an explicit isomorphism between self-similar IPS and graphon IPS, which allows us to justify the continuum and mean-field limits in the self-similar setting. This connection reveals that macroscopic dynamics on fractal domains emerge naturally as limits of dynamics on appropriate discretizations of fractal sets.
  Another contribution of the paper is the derivation of optimal convergence rates for the discrete self-similar models. We introduce a scale of generalized Lipschitz spaces on fractals, extending the Nikolskii-Besov spaces used in the Euclidean setting, and obtain convergence estimates for discontinuous Galerkin approximations of nonlocal equations posed on fractal domains. These results apply to kernels with minimal regularity addressing models relevant in applications.</description>

Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. This work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices.</description>

      <title>SLE and its partition function in multiply connected domains via the Gaussian Free Field and restriction measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One way to uniquely define Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) in multiply connected domains is to use the restriction property. This gives an implicit definition of a $\sigma$-finite measure on curves; yet it is in general not clear how to construct such measures nor whether the mass of these measures, called the partition function, is finite.
  We provide an explicit construction of the such conformal restriction SLEs in multiply connected domains when $\kappa = 4$ using the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). In particular, both when the target points of the curve are on the same or on distinct boundary components, we show that there is a mixture of laws of level lines of GFFs that satisfies the restriction property. This allows us to give an expression for the partition function of $\mathrm{SLE}_4$ on multiply connected domains and shows that the partition function is finite, answering the question raised in [Lawler, J. Stat. Phys. 2009].
  In a second part, we provide a second construction of $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$ in multiply-connected domains for the whole range $\kappa \in (8/3,4]$; specific, however, to the case of the two target points belonging to the same boundary components. This is inspired by [Werner, Wu, Electron. J. Probab. 2013] and consists of a mixture of laws on curves obtained by following $\mathrm{CLE}_\kappa$ loops and restriction hulls attached to parts of the boundary of the domain. In this case as well, we obtain as a corollary the finiteness of the partition function for this type of $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Achieving Entanglement Purification Protocol for Pauli Dephasing Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication enables secure information transmission and entanglement distribution, but these tasks are fundamentally limited by the capacities of quantum channels. While quantum repeaters can mitigate losses and noise, entanglement swapping via a central node is ineffective against the Pauli dephasing channel due to degradation from Bell-state measurements. This suggests that purifying distributed Bell states before entanglement swapping is necessary. Although one-way hashing codes are known to saturate the dephasing channel capacity, no explicit two-way purification protocol has previously been shown to achieve this bound. In this work, we present a two-way entanglement purification protocol with an explicit, scalable circuit that asymptotically achieves the dephasing channel capacity. With each iteration, the fidelity of Bell states increases. At the final round, the residual dephasing error is suppressed doubly-exponentially, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(p^{2^{n}})$, enabling near-perfect Bell pairs for any fixed number of purification rounds $n$. The explicit circuit we propose is versatile and applicable to any number of Bell pairs, offering a practical solution for mitigating decoherence in quantum networks and distributed.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic domain walls under spin-orbit torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls in antiferromagnets under a spin-polarized current present dynamical behavior that is not observed in ferromagnets, and it is tunable by the current polarization. Precessional dynamics is obtained for perpendicular spin polarization. In-plane polarization gives propagating walls. We obtain the velocity as a function of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, a power-law decay develops in the trailing tail of the wall. The main features of the wall profile are manifest in a direct solution of an equation that is valid in a limiting case. Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for a spin polarization that has both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is given. We discuss the modifications of the dynamics when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is present. Finally, we give the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations.</description>

      <title>Stable Evaluation of Lefschetz Thimble Intersection Numbers: Towards Real-Time Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a robust numerical method for determining intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings. Our approach employs the multiple shooting method to solve the upward flow equations from the saddle points to the original integration cycle, which also enables us to determine the signs of the intersection numbers. The method demonstrates stable and reliable performance, and has been tested for systems with up to $20$ variables, which can be further extended by adopting quadruple-precision arithmetic. We determine intersection numbers for several complex saddle points in a discretized path integral, providing new insights into the structure of real-time path integrals. The proposed method is broadly applicable to a wide range of problems involving oscillatory integrals in physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Reactive capacitance of flat patches of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity of a flat partially reactive patch of arbitrary shape to trap independent particles that undergo steady-state diffusion in the three-dimensional space. We focus on the total flux of particles onto the patch that determines its reactive capacitance. To disentangle the respective roles of the reactivity and the shape of the patch, we employ a spectral expansion of the reactive capacitance over a suitable Steklov eigenvalue problem. We derive several bounds on the reactive capacitance to reveal its monotonicity with respect to the reactivity and the shape. Two probabilistic interpretations are presented as well. An efficient numerical tool is developed for solving the associated Steklov spectral problem for patches of arbitrary shape. We propose and validate, both theoretically and numerically, a simple, fully explicit approximation for the reactive capacitance that depends only on the surface area and the electrostatic capacitance of the patch. This approximation opens promising ways to access various characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions in general domains with multiple small well-separated patches. Direct applications of these results in statistical physics and physical chemistry are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Dynamics of Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Universality in Composite Systems: A Trichotomy of Clifford Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Clifford group is efficiently classically simulable, and universality is obtained by supplementing it with non-Clifford resources. We determine which single-qudit gates suffice to achieve universality. We show that the structure of such resources is governed by the prime factorization of the qudit dimension $d$. Using the adjoint action on the space of complex trace-zero matrices, we relate density to irreducibility together with an infiniteness criterion, yielding a trichotomy based on the factorization of $d$. When $d$ is prime, any non-Clifford gate generates a dense subgroup of the determinant-one unitaries. If $d$ is a prime power, the adjoint action is reducible, and universality requires gates that couple the resulting invariant subspaces. For composite $d$ with pairwise coprime factors, generalized intra-qudit controlled-NOT gates connecting the factors already suffice. These findings suggest that ``composite architectures'' -- hybrid registers combining incommensurate dimensions -- offer a route to bypass the standard overhead associated with magic-state injection.</description>

      <title>Singular basins in multiscale systems: tunneling between stable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world systems often evolve on different timescales and possess multiple coexisting stable states. Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. We show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of singular funnels. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different regions of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the system's resilience to perturbations. Consequently, singular funnels may prevent common dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as the quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination and time-averaging of the fast variables. We refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels as singular basins. We show that singular basins are universal and occur robustly in a range of multiscale systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly adapting parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators.</description>
