      <title>Faster algorithms for the alignment of sparse correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph ensemble is a probability law on pairs of graphs with $n$ vertices, parametrized by their average degree $\lambda$ and their correlation coefficient $s$. It can be used as a benchmark for the graph alignment problem, in which the labels of the vertices of one of the graphs are reshuffled by an unknown permutation; the goal is to infer this permutation and thus properly match the pairs of vertices in both graphs. A series of recent works has unveiled the role of Otter's constant $\alpha$ (that controls the exponential rate of growth of the number of unlabeled rooted trees as a function of their sizes) in this problem: for $s&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ and $\lambda$ large enough it is possible to recover in a time polynomial in $n$ a positive fraction of the hidden permutation. The exponent of this polynomial growth is however quite large and depends on the other parameters, which limits the range of applications of the algorithm. In this work we present a family of faster algorithms for this task, show through numerical simulations that their accuracy is only slightly reduced with respect to the original one, and conjecture that they undergo, in the large $\lambda$ limit, phase transitions at modified Otter's thresholds $\sqrt{\widehat{\alpha}}&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$, with $\widehat{\alpha}$ related to the enumeration of a restricted family of trees.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium complex landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with a complex dynamics like glasses or models of biological evolution are often pictured in terms of complex landscapes, with a large number of possible collective states. We show on the example of a stochastic spin model with non-reciprocal and heterogeneous interactions how the complex landscape notion can be generalized far from equilibrium, where collective states may exhibit spontaneous oscillations, often hidden by the presence of disorder. We identify relevant observables, like the density of entropy production, to unveil the presence of oscillations, and we characterize the complex landscape of our model in terms of a configurational entropy, that counts the number of nonequilibrium collective states with a given entropy production density.</description>

      <title>Daydreaming Hopfield Networks and their surprising effectiveness on correlated data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the storage capacity of the Hopfield model, we develop a version of the dreaming algorithm that perpetually reinforces the patterns to be stored (as in the Hebb rule), and erases the spurious memories (as in dreaming algorithms). For this reason, we called it Daydreaming. Daydreaming is not destructive and it converges asymptotically to stationary retrieval maps. When trained on random uncorrelated examples, the model shows optimal performance in terms of the size of the basins of attraction of stored examples and the quality of reconstruction. We also train the Daydreaming algorithm on correlated data obtained via the random-features model and argue that it spontaneously exploits the correlations thus increasing even further the storage capacity and the size of the basins of attraction. Moreover, the Daydreaming algorithm is also able to stabilize the features hidden in the data. Finally, we test Daydreaming on the MNIST dataset and show that it still works surprisingly well, producing attractors that are close to unseen examples and class prototypes.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for $p$-spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network algorithm for the solution of $p$-spin models. We show that bond compression through rank-revealing decompositions performed during the tensor network contraction resolves logical redundancies in the system exactly and is thus lossless, yet leads to qualitative changes in runtime scaling in different regimes of the model. First, we find that bond compression emulates the so-called leaf-removal algorithm, solving the problem efficiently in the "easy" phase. Past a dynamical phase transition, we observe superpolynomial runtimes, reflecting the appearance of a core component. We then develop a graphical method to study the scaling of contraction for a minimal ensemble of core-only instances, for which leaf removal is ineffective. We find subexponential scaling, improving on the exponential scaling that occurs without compression. Our results suggest that our tensor network algorithm subsumes the classical leaf removal algorithm and simplifies redundancies in the $p$-spin model through lossless compression, all without explicit knowledge of the problem's structure.</description>

      <title>Structural fluctuations in active glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The glassy dynamics of dense active matter have recently become a topic of interest due to their importance in biological processes such as wound healing and tissue development. However, while the liquid-state properties of dense active matter have been studied in relation to the glass transition of active matter, the solid-state properties of active glasses have yet to be understood. In this work, we study the structural fluctuations in the active glasses composed of self-propelled particles. We develop a formalism to describe the solid-state properties of active glasses in the harmonic approximation limit and use it to analyze the displacement fields in the active glasses. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of high-frequency normal modes become quasi-static with respect to the active forces, and consequently, excitations of these modes are significantly suppressed. This leads to a violation of the equipartition law, suppression of particle displacements, and the apparent collective motion of active glasses. Overall, our results provide a fundamental understanding of the solid-state properties of active glasses.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of first-order quantum superconductor-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental studies on strongly disordered indium oxide films have revealed an unusual first-order quantum phase transition between the superconducting and insulating states (SIT). This transition is characterized by a discontinuous jump from non-zero to zero values of superfluid stiffness at the critical point, contradicting the conventional ``scaling scenario'' typically associated with SIT. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for understanding this first-order transition. Our approach is based on the concept of competition between two fundamentally distinct ground states that arise from electron pairs initially localized by strong disorder: the superconducting state and the Coulomb glass insulator. These ground states are distinguished by two crucially different order parameters, suggesting a natural expectation of a discontinuous transition between them at $T=0$. This transition occurs when the magnitudes of the superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the Coulomb gap $E_C$ become comparable. Additionally, we extend our analysis to low non-zero temperatures and provide a mean-field ``phase diagram'' in the plane of $(T/\Delta,E_C/\Delta)$. Our results reveal the existence of a natural upper bound for the kinetic inductance of strongly disordered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Flat band based delocalized-to-localized transitions in a non-Hermitian diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of quasiperiodic perturbations on one-dimensional non-Hermitian diamond lattices with an artificial magnetic flux $\theta$ that possess flat bands. Our study shows that the symmetry of these perturbations and the magnetic flux $\theta$ play a pivotal role in shaping the localization properties of the system. When $\theta=0$, the non-Hermitian lattice exhibits a single flat band in the crystalline case, and symmetric as well as antisymmetric perturbations can induce accurate mobility edges. In contrast, when $\theta=\pi$, the clean diamond lattice manifests three dispersionless bands referred to as an "all-band-flat" (ABF) structure, irrespective of the non-Hermitian parameter. The ABF structure restricts the transition from delocalized to localized states, as all states remain localized for any finite symmetric perturbation. Our numerical calculations further unveil that the ABF system subjected to antisymmetric perturbations exhibits multifractal-to-localized edges. Multifractal states are predominantly concentrated in the internal region of the spectrum. Additionally, we explore the case where $\theta$ lies within the range of $(0, \pi)$, revealing a diverse array of complex localization features.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Can Neural Quantum States Learn Volume-Law Ground States?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passetti et al. [Physical Review Letters 131, 036502 (2023)] recently assessed the potential of neural quantum states (NQS) in learning ground-state wave functions with volume-law entanglement scaling. They focused on NQS using feedforward neural networks, specifically applied to the complex SYK Hamiltonian for fermions. Their numerical results hint at an exponential increase in the required variational parameters as the system size grows, apparently tied to the entanglement growth within the SYK ground state. This challenges the general utility of NQS for highly entangled wavefunctions, contrasting with established analytical and numerical findings. Based on our experiments, we show that suitably chosen NQS can learn ground states with volume-law entanglement both for spin and fermionic problems. We argue that the setup utilized in the aforementioned letter reveals the inefficiency of non-fermionic NQS to learn fermionic states, rather than a general connection between entanglement content and learnability hardness.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the overlap distribution in driven mean-field spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a statistical physics context, inverse problems consist in determining microscopic interactions such that a system reaches a predefined collective state. A complex collective state may be prescribed by specifying the overlap distribution between microscopic configurations, a notion originally introduced in the context of disordered systems like spin-glasses. We show that in spite of the absence of disorder, nonequilibrium spin models exhibiting spontaneous magnetization oscillations provide a benchmark to prescribe a non-trivial overlap distribution with continuous support, qualitatively analogous to the ones found in disordered systems with full replica symmetry breaking. The overlap distribution can be explicitly tailored to take a broad range of predefined shapes by monitoring the spin dynamics. The presence of a non-trivial overlap distribution is traced back to an average over infinitely many pure states, a feature shared with spin-glasses, although the structure of pure states is here much simpler.</description>
