      <title>Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects and Network Fragility: Theory and Evidence from the 2008 Financial Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2008 financial crisis exposed fundamental vulnerabilities in interconnected banking systems, yet existing frameworks fail to integrate spatial propagation with network contagion mechanisms. This paper develops a unified spatial-network framework to analyze systemic risk dynamics, revealing three critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom. First, banking consolidation paradoxically increased systemic fragility: while bank numbers declined 47.3% from 2007 to 2023, network fragility measured by algebraic connectivity rose 315.8%, demonstrating that interconnectedness intensity dominates institutional count. Second, financial contagion propagates globally with negligible spatial decay (boundary d* = 47,474 km), contrasting sharply with localized technology diffusion (d* = 69 km)--a scale difference of 688 times. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods overestimate crisis impacts by 73.2% when ignoring network structure, producing severely biased policy assessments. Using bilateral exposure data from 156 institutions across 28 countries (2007-2023) and employing spectral analysis of network Laplacian operators combined with spatial difference-in-differences identification, we document that crisis effects amplified over time rather than dissipating, increasing fragility 68.4% above pre-crisis levels with persistent effects through 2023. The consolidation paradox exhibits near-perfect correlation (R = 0.97) between coupling strength and systemic vulnerability, validating theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Policy simulations demonstrate network-targeted capital requirements achieve 11.3x amplification effects versus uniform regulations. These findings establish that accurate systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policy design require explicit incorporation of both spatial propagation and network topology.</description>

      <title>Robust distortion risk metrics and portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp upper and lower bounds for distortion risk metrics under distributional uncertainty. The uncertainty sets are characterized by four key features of the underlying distribution: mean, variance, unimodality, and Wasserstein distance to a reference distribution.
  We first examine very general distortion risk metrics, assuming only finite variation for the underlying distortion function and without requiring continuity or monotonicity. This broad framework includes notable distortion risk metrics such as range value-at-risk, glue value-at-risk, Gini deviation, mean-median deviation and inter-quantile difference. In this setting, when the uncertainty set is characterized by a fixed mean, variance and a Wasserstein distance, we determine both the worst- and best-case values of a given distortion risk metric and identify the corresponding extremal distribution. When the uncertainty set is further constrained by unimodality with a fixed inflection point, we establish for the case of absolutely continuous distortion functions the extremal values along with their respective extremal distributions. We apply our results to robust portfolio optimization and model risk assessment offering improved decision-making under model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty and financial market resilience: Evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial market resilience reflects the ability of a financial market to withstand external shocks and to recover from them, while its measurement has yet to be standardized. Accordingly, this paper quantifies the adaptability and recoverability of China's total financial market and five key sub-markets as both proxy indicators of their resilience. The results highlight the event-driven nature of China's financial market resilience and reveal a strong correlation between the two indicators, which is more pronounced in the stock and bond markets. Using the Diebold-Yilmaz connectedness approach, we further examine volatility spillovers among resilience of sub-markets and identify the foreign exchange market as a major transmitter of spillovers, whereas the stock and bulk commodity markets primarily act as net recipients of spillovers. Moreover, we analyze the impacts of five China-related uncertainties on financial market resilience. Overall, geopolitical risks, economic and trade policy uncertainty, and U.S.-China tensions exert significant negative impacts on total market resilience, while the effect of climate policy uncertainty remains less pronounced. Importantly, the impacts of different uncertainties exhibit heterogeneity across resilience of sub-markets. Our findings not only enrich the resilience measurement of financial market but also provide new evidence to inform targeted risk management and policy design aimed at strengthening financial system's resilience.</description>

      <title>Does the square-root price impact law belong to the strict universal scalings?: quantitative support by a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>
