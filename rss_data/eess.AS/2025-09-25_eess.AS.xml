      <title>Data-Efficient ASR Personalization for Non-Normative Speech Using an Uncertainty-Based Phoneme Difficulty Score for Guided Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with non-normative speech from individuals with impairments caused by conditions like cerebral palsy or structural anomalies. The high acoustic variability and scarcity of training data severely degrade model performance. This work introduces a data-efficient personalization method that quantifies phoneme-level uncertainty to guide fine-tuning. We leverage Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate which phonemes a model finds most difficult and use these estimates for a targeted oversampling strategy. We validate our method on English and German datasets. Crucially, we demonstrate that our model-derived uncertainty strongly correlates with phonemes identified as challenging in an expert clinical logopedic report, marking, to our knowledge, the first work to successfully align model uncertainty with expert assessment of speech difficulty. Our results show that this clinically-validated, uncertainty-guided sampling significantly improves ASR accuracy, delivering a practical framework for personalized and inclusive ASR.</description>

      <title>Variational Low-Rank Adaptation for Personalized Impaired Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech impairments resulting from congenital disorders, such as cerebral palsy, down syndrome, or apert syndrome, as well as acquired brain injuries due to stroke, traumatic accidents, or tumors, present major challenges to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Despite recent advancements, state-of-the-art ASR models like Whisper still struggle with non-normative speech due to limited training data availability and high acoustic variability. Moreover, collecting and annotating non-normative speech is burdensome: speaking is effortful for many affected individuals, while laborious annotation often requires caregivers familiar with the speaker. This work introduces a novel ASR personalization method based on Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation for data-efficient fine-tuning. We validate our method on the English UA-Speech dataset and a newly collected German speech dataset, BF-Sprache, from a child with structural speech impairment. The dataset and approach are designed to reflect the challenges of low-resource settings that include individuals with speech impairments. Our method significantly improves ASR accuracy for impaired speech while maintaining data and annotation efficiency, offering a practical path toward inclusive ASR.</description>

      <title>Phoenix-VAD: Streaming Semantic Endpoint Detection for Full-Duplex Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue models have significantly advanced intelligent human\textendash computer interaction, yet they lack a plug\textendash and\textendash play full\textendash duplex prediction module for semantic endpoint detection, hindering seamless audio interactions. In this paper, we introduce Phoenix\textendashVAD, an LLM\textendash based model that enables streaming semantic endpoint detection. Specifically, Phoenix\textendash VAD leverages the semantic comprehension capability of the LLM and a sliding window training strategy to achieve reliable semantic endpoint detection while supporting streaming inference. Experiments on both semantically complete and incomplete speech scenarios indicate that Phoenix\textendash VAD achieves excellent and competitive performance. Furthermore, this design enables the full\textendash duplex prediction module to be optimized independently of the dialogue model, providing more reliable and flexible support for next\textendash generation human\textendash computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.</description>

      <title>Real-Time System for Audio-Visual Target Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel, audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup, with clean speech playback through headphones.</description>

      <title>SPADE: Structured Pruning and Adaptive Distillation for Efficient LLM-TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to introduce SPADE, a framework for Structured Pruning and Adaptive Distillation for Efficient Large Language Model-based text-to-speech (LLM-TTS). Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data. These results show that compact LLM-TTS models can maintain naturalness and speaker similarity while enabling practical real-time speech generation. Audio samples are available at https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/projects/SPADE/.</description>

      <title>PAS-SE: Personalized Auxiliary-Sensor Speech Enhancement for Voice Pickup in Hearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech enhancement for voice pickup in hearables aims to improve the user's voice by suppressing noise and interfering talkers, while maintaining own-voice quality. For single-channel methods, it is particularly challenging to distinguish the target from interfering talkers without additional context. In this paper, we compare two strategies to resolve this ambiguity: personalized speech enhancement (PSE), which uses enrollment utterances to represent the target, and auxiliary-sensor speech enhancement (AS-SE), which uses in-ear microphones as additional input. We evaluate the strategies on two public datasets, employing different auxiliary sensor arrays, to investigate their cross-dataset generalization. We propose training-time augmentations to facilitate cross-dataset generalization of AS-SE systems. We also show that combining PSE and AS-SE (PAS-SE) provides complementary performance benefits, especially when enrollment speech is recorded with the in-ear microphone. We further demonstrate that PAS-SE personalized with noisy in-ear enrollments maintains performance benefits over the AS-SE system.</description>

      <title>TF-Restormer: Complex Spectral Prediction for Speech Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech restoration in real-world conditions is challenging due to compounded distortions such as clipping, band-pass filtering, digital artifacts, noise, and reverberation, and low sampling rates. Existing systems, including vocoder-based approaches, often sacrifice signal fidelity, while diffusion models remain impractical for streaming. Moreover, most assume a fixed target sampling rate, requiring external resampling that leads to redundant computations. We present TF-Restormer, an encoder-decoder architecture that concentrates analysis on input-bandwidth with a time-frequency dual-path encoder and reconstructs missing high-frequency bands through a light decoder with frequency extension queries. It enables efficient and universal restoration across arbitrary input-output rates without redundant resampling. To support adversarial training across diverse rates, we introduce a shared sampling-frequency-independent (SFI) STFT discriminator. TF-Restormer further supports streaming with a causal time module, and improves robustness under extreme degradations by injecting spectral inductive bias into the frequency module. Finally, we propose a scaled log-spectral loss that stabilizes optimization under severe conditions while emphasizing well-predicted spectral details. As a single model across sampling rates, TF-Restormer consistently outperforms prior systems, achieving balanced gains in signal fidelity and perceptual quality, while its streaming mode maintains competitive effectiveness for real-time application. Code and demos are available at https://tf-restormer.github.io/demo.</description>

      <title>Measuring Audio's Impact on Correctness: Audio-Contribution-Aware Post-Training of Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) represent an important frontier in multimodal AI, addressing diverse audio tasks. Recently, post-training of LALMs has received increasing attention due to significant performance improvements over foundation models. While single-stage post-training such as reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results, multi-stage approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL remain suboptimal. The allocation of data across multiple training stages to maximize LALM capabilities has not been fully explored, and large-scale, high-quality datasets for such research are also lacking. To address these problems, we firstly present AudioMCQ, a comprehensive audio multiple-choice question dataset comprising 571k samples with two kinds of chain-of-thought annotations. Secondly, we investigate the prevalent zero audio-contribution phenomenon in LALMs, where models derive correct answers solely from textual information without processing audio content. We propose Audio-Contribution Filtering to partition data into weak and strong audio-contribution subsets. Based on these insights, we develop two effective post-training paradigms: Weak-to-Strong (SFT on weak audio-contribution data followed by RL on strong audio-contribution data) and Mixed-to-Strong (SFT on mixed audio-contribution data followed by RL on strong audio-contribution data). We achieve first place in the DCASE 2025 Audio-Question-Answering challenge by using AudioMCQ. Additionally, leveraging our dataset with different training strategies, we achieve 78.2\% on MMAU-test-mini, 75.6\% on MMAU, 67.1\% on MMAR, and 70.7\% on MMSU, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across these benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Are Modern Speech Enhancement Systems Vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose hybrid real- and complex-valued neural networks for speech enhancement. Real- or complex-valued models are either inefficient or present high complexity. We devise a straightforward design method for extending a real-valued network into its hybrid counterpart. Based on speech intelligibility and quality metrics, we compare the real, complex, and hybrid versions of a convolutional and a convolutional-recurrent architecture. The hybrid network consistently outperforms its counterparts with the same number of parameters. Additionally, the hybrid models' complexity in terms of multiply-accumulate operations is substantially lower than that of their counterparts.</description>

      <title>MeanSE: Efficient Generative Speech Enhancement with Mean Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) improves degraded speech's quality, with generative models like flow matching gaining attention for their outstanding perceptual quality. However, the flow-based model requires multiple numbers of function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve stable and satisfactory performance, leading to high computational load and poor 1-NFE performance. In this paper, we propose MeanSE, an efficient generative speech enhancement model using mean flows, which models the average velocity field to achieve high-quality 1-NFE enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MeanSE significantly outperforms the flow matching baseline with a single NFE, exhibiting extremely better out-of-domain generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Why Speech Deepfake Detectors Won't Generalize: The Limits of Detection in an Open World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech deepfake detectors are often evaluated on clean, benchmark-style conditions, but deployment occurs in an open world of shifting devices, sampling rates, codecs, environments, and attack families. This creates a ``coverage debt" for AI-based detectors: every new condition multiplies with existing ones, producing data blind spots that grow faster than data can be collected. Because attackers can target these uncovered regions, worst-case performance (not average benchmark scores) determines security. To demonstrate the impact of the coverage debt problem, we analyze results from a recent cross-testing framework. Grouping performance by bona fide domain and spoof release year, two patterns emerge: newer synthesizers erase the legacy artifacts detectors rely on, and conversational speech domains (teleconferencing, interviews, social media) are consistently the hardest to secure. These findings show that detection alone should not be relied upon for high-stakes decisions. Detectors should be treated as auxiliary signals within layered defenses that include provenance, personhood credentials, and policy safeguards.</description>

      <title>Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.</description>

      <title>MI-Fuse: Label Fusion for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Closed-Source Large-Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask: given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.</description>

      <title>SingVERSE: A Diverse, Real-World Benchmark for Singing Voice Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a benchmark for singing voice enhancement. The development of singing voice enhancement is limited by the lack of realistic evaluation data. To address this gap, this paper introduces SingVERSE, the first real-world benchmark for singing voice enhancement, covering diverse acoustic scenarios and providing paired, studio-quality clean references. Leveraging SingVERSE, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and uncover a consistent trade-off between perceptual quality and intelligibility. Finally, we show that training on in-domain singing data substantially improves enhancement performance without degrading speech capabilities, establishing a simple yet effective path forward. This work offers the community a foundational benchmark together with critical insights to guide future advances in this underexplored domain. Demopage: https://singverse.github.io</description>

      <title>Scaling Rich Style-Prompted Text-to-Speech Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Paralinguistic Speech Captions (ParaSpeechCaps), a large-scale dataset that annotates speech utterances with rich style captions. While rich abstract tags (e.g. guttural, nasal, pained) have been explored in small-scale human-annotated datasets, existing large-scale datasets only cover basic tags (e.g. low-pitched, slow, loud). We combine off-the-shelf text and speech embedders, classifiers and an audio language model to automatically scale rich tag annotations for the first time. ParaSpeechCaps covers a total of 59 style tags, including both speaker-level intrinsic tags and utterance-level situational tags. It consists of 342 hours of human-labelled data (PSC-Base) and 2427 hours of automatically annotated data (PSC-Scaled). We finetune Parler-TTS, an open-source style-prompted TTS model, on ParaSpeechCaps, and achieve improved style consistency (+7.9% Consistency MOS) and speech quality (+15.5% Naturalness MOS) over the best performing baseline that combines existing rich style tag datasets. We ablate several of our dataset design choices to lay the foundation for future work in this space. Our dataset, models and code are released at https://github.com/ajd12342/paraspeechcaps .</description>

      <title>Lessons Learnt: Revisit Key Training Strategies for Effective Speech Emotion Recognition in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit key training strategies in machine learning often overlooked in favor of deeper architectures. Specifically, we explore balancing strategies, activation functions, and fine-tuning techniques to enhance speech emotion recognition (SER) in naturalistic conditions. Our findings show that simple modifications improve generalization with minimal architectural changes. Our multi-modal fusion model, integrating these optimizations, achieves a valence CCC of 0.6953, the best valence score in Task 2: Emotional Attribute Regression. Notably, fine-tuning RoBERTa and WavLM separately in a single-modality setting, followed by feature fusion without training the backbone extractor, yields the highest valence performance. Additionally, focal loss and activation functions significantly enhance performance without increasing complexity. These results suggest that refining core components, rather than deepening models, leads to more robust SER in-the-wild.</description>

      <title>MAGE: A Coarse-to-Fine Speech Enhancer with Masked Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and perceptual quality. In this paper, we introduce MAGE, a Masked Audio Generative Enhancer that advances generative speech enhancement through a compact and robust design. Unlike prior masked generative models with random masking, MAGE employs a scarcity-aware coarse-to-fine masking strategy that prioritizes frequent tokens in early steps and rare tokens in later refinements, improving efficiency and generalization. We also propose a lightweight corrector module that further stabilizes inference by detecting low-confidence predictions and re-masking them for refinement. Built on BigCodec and finetuned from Qwen2.5-0.5B, MAGE is reduced to 200M parameters through selective layer retention. Experiments on DNS Challenge and noisy LibriSpeech show that MAGE achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and significantly reduces word error rate for downstream recognition, outperforming larger baselines. Audio examples are available at https://hieugiaosu.github.io/MAGE/.</description>

      <title>Measuring Prosody Diversity in Zero-Shot TTS: A New Metric, Benchmark, and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prosody diversity is essential for achieving naturalness and expressiveness in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS). However, frequently used acoustic metrics capture only partial views of prosodic variation and correlate poorly with human perception, leaving the problem of reliably quantifying prosody diversity underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProsodyEval, a prosody diversity assessment dataset that provides Prosody Mean Opinion Score (PMOS) alongside conventional acoustic metrics. ProsodyEval comprises 1000 speech samples derived from 7 mainstream TTS systems, with 2000 human ratings. Building on this, we propose the Discretized Speech Weighted Edit Distance (DS-WED), a new objective diversity metric that quantifies prosodic variation via weighted edit distance over semantic tokens. Experiments on ProsodyEval show that DS-WED achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgments than existing acoustic metrics, while remaining highly robust in speech tokenization from HuBERT and WavLM. Leveraging DS-WED, we benchmark state-of-the-art open-source TTS systems on LibriSpeech test-clean and Seed-TTS test-en, and further explorations uncover several factors that influence prosody diversity, including generative modeling paradigms, duration control, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we find that current large audio language models (LALMs) remain limited in capturing prosodic variations. Audio samples are available at https://prosodyeval.github.io.</description>

      <title>Application of Audio Fingerprinting Techniques for Real-Time Scalable Speech Retrieval and Speech Clusterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio fingerprinting techniques have seen great advances in recent years, enabling accurate and fast audio retrieval even in conditions when the queried audio sample has been highly deteriorated or recorded in noisy conditions. Expectedly, most of the existing work is centered around music, with popular music identification services such as Apple's Shazam or Google's Now Playing designed for individual audio recognition on mobile devices. However, the spectral content of speech differs from that of music, necessitating modifications to current audio fingerprinting approaches. This paper offers fresh insights into adapting existing techniques to address the specialized challenge of speech retrieval in telecommunications and cloud communications platforms. The focus is on achieving rapid and accurate audio retrieval in batch processing instead of facilitating single requests, typically on a centralized server. Moreover, the paper demonstrates how this approach can be utilized to support audio clustering based on speech transcripts without undergoing actual speech-to-text conversion. This optimization enables significantly faster processing without the need for GPU computing, a requirement for real-time operation that is typically associated with state-of-the-art speech-to-text tools.</description>

      <title>LAMA-UT: Language Agnostic Multilingual ASR through Orthography Unification and Language-Specific Transliteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.</description>

      <title>On the Language and Gender Biases in PSTN, VoIP and Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing focus on fairness and inclusivity within speech technology, particularly in areas such as automatic speech recognition and speech sentiment analysis. When audio is transcoded prior to processing, as is the case in streaming or real-time applications, any inherent bias in the coding mechanism may result in disparities. This not only affects user experience but can also have broader societal implications by perpetuating stereotypes and exclusion. Thus, it is important that audio coding mechanisms are unbiased. In this work, we contribute towards the scarce research with respect to language and gender biases of audio codecs. By analyzing the speech quality of over 2 million multilingual audio files after transcoding through a representative subset of codecs (PSTN, VoIP and neural), our results indicate that PSTN codecs are strongly biased in terms of gender and that neural codecs introduce language biases.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Embeddings of Speech Enhance and Explain Brain Encoding Performance of Audio Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are increasingly hailed as powerful computational models of human speech perception. However, since their representations are inherently black-box, it remains unclear what drives their alignment with brain responses. To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six interpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features, speech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic features, and contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SFMs (Whisper, HuBERT, WavLM), quantifying electrocorticography (ECoG) response variance shared between feature classes. Variance-partitioning analyses revealed several key insights: First, the SFMs' alignment with the brain can be mostly explained by their ability to learn and encode simple interpretable speech features. Second, SFMs exhibit a systematic trade-off between encoding of brain-relevant low-level and high-level features across layers. Finally, our results show that SFMs learn brain-relevant semantics which cannot be explained by lower-level speech features, with this capacity increasing with model size and context length. Together, our findings suggest a principled approach to build more interpretable, accurate, and efficient encoding models of the brain by augmenting SFM embeddings with interpretable features.</description>

      <title>Canary-1B-v2 &amp; Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3: Efficient and High-Performance Models for Multilingual ASR and AST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report introduces Canary-1B-v2, a fast, robust multilingual model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech-to-Text Translation (AST). Built with a FastConformer encoder and Transformer decoder, it supports 25 languages primarily European. The model was trained on 1.7M hours of total data samples, including Granary and NeMo ASR Set 3.0, with non-speech audio added to reduce hallucinations for ASR and AST. We describe its two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning process with dynamic data balancing, as well as experiments with an nGPT encoder. Results show nGPT scales well with massive data, while FastConformer excels after fine-tuning. For timestamps, Canary-1B-v2 uses the NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) with an auxiliary CTC model, providing reliable segment-level timestamps for ASR and AST. Evaluations show Canary-1B-v2 outperforms Whisper-large-v3 on English ASR while being 10x faster, and delivers competitive multilingual ASR and AST performance against larger models like Seamless-M4T-v2-large and LLM-based systems. We also release Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3, a successor to v2, offering multilingual ASR across the same 25 languages with just 600M parameters.</description>

Abstract: We present our journey in training a speech language model for Wolof, an underrepresented language spoken in West Africa, and share key insights. We first emphasize the importance of collecting large-scale, spontaneous, high-quality unsupervised speech data, and show that continued pretraining HuBERT on this dataset outperforms both the base model and African-centric models on ASR. We then integrate this speech encoder into a Wolof LLM to train the first Speech LLM for this language, extending its capabilities to tasks such as speech translation. Furthermore, we explore training the Speech LLM to perform multi-step Chain-of-Thought before transcribing or translating. Our results show that the Speech LLM not only improves speech recognition but also performs well in speech translation. The models and the code will be openly shared.</description>

      <title>MNV-17: A High-Quality Performative Mandarin Dataset for Nonverbal Vocalization Recognition in Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems excel at transcribing lexical content, but largely fail to recognize nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) embedded in speech, such as sighs, laughs, and coughs. This capability is important for a comprehensive understanding of human communication, as NVs convey crucial emotional and intentional cues. Progress in NV-aware ASR has been hindered by the lack of high-quality, well-annotated datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MNV-17, a 7.55-hour performative Mandarin speech dataset. Unlike most existing corpora that rely on model-based detection, MNV-17's performative nature ensures high-fidelity, clearly articulated NV instances. To the best of our knowledge, MNV-17 provides the most extensive set of nonverbal vocalization categories, comprising 17 distinct and well-balanced classes of common NVs. We benchmarked MNV-17 on four mainstream ASR architectures, evaluating their joint performance on semantic transcription and NV classification. The dataset and the pretrained model checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate future research in expressive ASR.</description>
