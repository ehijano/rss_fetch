      <title>How to Engage Active Pedagogy with Physics Faculty: Watch Out for Powerlessness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the large body of research showing that students in STEM classes at all levels learn better via active learning than they do via lecture, post-secondary physics and astronomy (P&amp;A) faculty members continue to primarily use teacher-focused, lecture pedagogy in their classes. Methods include answers from eight faculty members, and interviews with five faculty members who self-identified as primarily using lecture were conducted to determine their perceptions of why they use lecture. During analysis coding, results show that an unanticipated theme not sufficiently represented in the pre-existing literature rose to the forefront: that many of these faculty members feel the decision of pedagogy is out of their control. In conclusion, a grounded theory was developed and is proposed herein that these faculty feel a sense of powerlessness. Reasons offered include administrators often make decisions based on the financial needs of the school, which then force the faculty into using lecture as their primary pedagogy. Implications include that providing professional development in active pedagogies may not be sufficient to help faculty members change pedagogy, as they may need to be convinced that they have the power to make change and use student-centered, active learning pedagogies within their own individual constraints and settings. Understanding that some instructors may feel powerless in choosing how to teach is an important step for professional development providers toward ensuring that faculty have a voice and can choose the best teaching methods for their classrooms.</description>

      <title>What happens if you put your head in the Geneva water jet? An inquiry-based physics activity exploring fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a physics education activity for third-year Bachelor students, inspired by a humorous question about the Geneva water jet. The exercise engages students in key scientific practices: reformulating everyday questions in scientific terms, constructing simplified models, performing semi-quantitative estimations, and comparing alternative solution methods. Students explore approaches based on Bernoulli principle and a power analysis, revealing consistent results when assumptions are carefully considered. The activity emphasizes critical reasoning, including identifying relevant data, making approximations, and applying energy and mass conservation to incompressible fluids. It also fosters metacognitive skills and higher-order thinking (HOT), illustrating the universality of fundamental physical principles across diverse phenomena. By situating the task in a relatable, real-world context, the activity motivates students while exposing them to problem-solving challenges rarely encountered in traditional instruction, such as Fermi-type estimation and cross-context knowledge transfer.</description>
