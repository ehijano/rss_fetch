      <title>Guaranteed Nonconvex Low-Rank Tensor Estimation via Scaled Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensors, which give a faithful and effective representation to deliver the intrinsic structure of multi-dimensional data, play a crucial role in an increasing number of signal processing and machine learning problems. However, tensor data are often accompanied by arbitrary signal corruptions, including missing entries and sparse noise. A fundamental challenge is to reliably extract the meaningful information from corrupted tensor data in a statistically and computationally efficient manner. This paper develops a scaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly estimate the tensor factors with tailored spectral initializations under the tensor-tensor product (t-product) and tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) framework. In theory, ScaledGD achieves linear convergence at a constant rate that is independent of the condition number of the ground truth low-rank tensor for two canonical problems -- tensor robust principal component analysis and tensor completion -- as long as the level of corruptions is not too large and the sample size is sufficiently large, while maintaining the low per-iteration cost of gradient descent. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that provably has such properties for low-rank tensor estimation with the t-SVD decomposition. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of ScaledGD in accelerating the convergence rate of ill-conditioned low-rank tensor estimation in these two applications.</description>

      <title>Unified Native Spaces in Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists a plethora of parametric models for positive definite kernels, and their use is ubiquitous in disciplines as diverse as statistics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and approximation theory. Usually, the kernel parameters index certain features of an associated process. Amongst those features, smoothness (in the sense of Sobolev spaces, mean square differentiability, and fractal dimensions), compact or global supports, and negative dependencies (hole effects) are of interest to several theoretical and applied disciplines. This paper unifies a wealth of well-known kernels into a single parametric class that encompasses them as special cases, attained either by exact parameterization or through parametric asymptotics. We furthermore characterize the Sobolev space that is norm equivalent to the RKHS associated with the new kernel. As a by-product, we infer the Sobolev spaces that are associated with existing classes of kernels. We illustrate the main properties of the new class, show how this class can switch from compact to global supports, and provide special cases for which the kernel attains negative values over nontrivial intervals. Hence, the proposed class of kernel is the reproducing kernel of a very rich Hilbert space that contains many special cases, including the celebrated Mat\'ern and Wendland kernels, as well as their aliases with hole effects.</description>

      <title>Signal Recovery Using a Spiked Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the spiked mixture model (SMM) to address the problem of estimating a set of signals from many randomly scaled and noisy observations. Subsequently, we design a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to recover all parameters of the SMM. Numerical experiments show that in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, and for data types where the SMM is relevant, SMM surpasses the more traditional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in terms of signal recovery performance. The broad relevance of the SMM and its corresponding EM recovery algorithm is demonstrated by applying the technique to different data types. The first case study is a biomedical research application, utilizing an imaging mass spectrometry dataset to explore the molecular content of a rat brain tissue section at micrometer scale. The second case study demonstrates SMM performance in a computer vision application, segmenting a hyperspectral imaging dataset into underlying patterns. While the measurement modalities differ substantially, in both case studies SMM is shown to recover signals that were missed by traditional methods such as k-means clustering and GMM.</description>

      <title>Transfer Neyman-Pearson Algorithm for Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer learning in outlier detection where target abnormal data is rare. While transfer learning has been considered extensively in traditional balanced classification, the problem of transfer in outlier detection and more generally in imbalanced classification settings has received less attention. We propose a general meta-algorithm which is shown theoretically to yield strong guarantees w.r.t. to a range of changes in abnormal distribution, and at the same time amenable to practical implementation. We then investigate different instantiations of this general meta-algorithm, e.g., based on multi-layer neural networks, and show empirically that they outperform natural extensions of transfer methods for traditional balanced classification settings (which are the only solutions available at the moment).</description>

      <title>Many of Your DPOs are Secretly One: Attempting Unification Through Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical in improving their utility, safety, and alignment with human intentions. Direct preference optimisation (DPO) has become one of the most widely used algorithms for achieving this alignment, given its ability to optimise models based on human feedback directly. However, the vast number of DPO variants in the literature has made it increasingly difficult for researchers to navigate and fully grasp the connections between these approaches. This paper introduces a unifying framework inspired by mutual information, which proposes a new loss function with flexible priors. By carefully specifying these priors, we demonstrate that many existing algorithms, such as SimPO, TDPO, SparsePO, and others, can be derived from our framework. This unification offers a clearer and more structured approach, allowing researchers to understand the relationships between different DPO variants better. We aim to simplify the landscape of DPO algorithms, making it easier for the research community to gain insights and foster further advancements in LLM alignment. Ultimately, we hope our framework can be a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable alignment techniques.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Bayesian optimisation in reduced dimension for engineering design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation is an adaptive sampling strategy for constructing a Gaussian process surrogate to emulate a black-box computational model with the aim of efficiently searching for the global minimum. However, Gaussian processes have limited applicability for engineering problems with many design variables. Their scalability can be significantly improved by identifying a low-dimensional vector of latent variables that serve as inputs to the Gaussian process. In this paper, we introduce a multi-view learning strategy that considers both the input design variables and output data representing the objective or constraint functions, to identify a low-dimensional space of latent variables. Adopting a fully probabilistic viewpoint, we use probabilistic partial least squares (PPLS) to learn an orthogonal mapping from the design variables to the latent variables using training data consisting of inputs and outputs of the black-box computational model. The latent variables and posterior probability densities of the probabilistic partial least squares and Gaussian process models are determined sequentially and iteratively, with retraining occurring at each adaptive sampling iteration. We compare the proposed probabilistic partial least squares Bayesian optimisation (PPLS-BO) strategy to its deterministic counterpart, partial least squares Bayesian optimisation (PLS-BO), and classical Bayesian optimisation, demonstrating significant improvements in convergence to the global minimum.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of a factorizable density using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models, and more generally score-based deep generative models, have achieved remarkable success in various applications, including image and audio generation. In this paper, we view diffusion models as an implicit approach to nonparametric density estimation and study them within a statistical framework to analyze their surprising performance. A key challenge in high-dimensional statistical inference is leveraging low-dimensional structures inherent in the data to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. We assume that the underlying density exhibits a low-dimensional structure by factorizing into low-dimensional components, a property common in examples such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields. Under suitable assumptions, we demonstrate that an implicit density estimator constructed from diffusion models adapts to the factorization structure and achieves the minimax optimal rate with respect to the total variation distance. In constructing the estimator, we design a sparse weight-sharing neural network architecture, where sparsity and weight-sharing are key features of practical architectures such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>On robust recovery of signals from indirect observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an uncertain linear inverse problem as follows. Given observation $\omega=Ax_*+\zeta$ where $A\in {\bf R}^{m\times p}$ and $\zeta\in {\bf R}^{m}$ is observation noise, we want to recover unknown signal $x_*$, known to belong to a convex set ${\cal X}\subset{\bf R}^{n}$. As opposed to the "standard" setting of such problem, we suppose that the model noise $\zeta$ is "corrupted" -- contains an uncertain (deterministic dense or singular) component. Specifically, we assume that $\zeta$ decomposes into $\zeta=N\nu_*+\xi$ where $\xi$ is the random noise and $N\nu_*$ is the "adversarial contamination" with known $\cal N\subset {\bf R}^n$ such that $\nu_*\in \cal N$ and $N\in {\bf R}^{m\times n}$. We consider two "uncertainty setups" in which $\cal N$ is either a convex bounded set or is the set of sparse vectors (with at most $s$ nonvanishing entries). We analyse the performance of "uncertainty-immunized" polyhedral estimates -- a particular class of nonlinear estimates as introduced in [15, 16] -- and show how "presumably good" estimates of the sort may be constructed in the situation where the signal set is an ellitope (essentially, a symmetric convex set delimited by quadratic surfaces) by means of efficient convex optimization routines.</description>

      <title>Ano-SuPs: Multi-size anomaly detection for manufactured products by identifying suspected patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-based systems have gained popularity owing to their capacity to provide rich manufacturing status information, low implementation costs and high acquisition rates. However, the complexity of the image background and various anomaly patterns pose new challenges to existing matrix decomposition methods, which are inadequate for modeling requirements. Moreover, the uncertainty of the anomaly can cause anomaly contamination problems, making the designed model and method highly susceptible to external disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage strategy anomaly detection method that detects anomalies by identifying suspected patches (Ano-SuPs). Specifically, we propose to detect the patches with anomalies by reconstructing the input image twice: the first step is to obtain a set of normal patches by removing those suspected patches, and the second step is to use those normal patches to refine the identification of the patches with anomalies. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate the proposed method systematically through simulation experiments and case studies. We further identified the key parameters and designed steps that impact the model's performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sparsified Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for High-Dimensional Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference of the high-dimensional regression coefficients is challenging because the uncertainty introduced by the model selection procedure is hard to account for. A critical question remains unsettled; that is, is it possible and how to embed the inference of the model into the simultaneous inference of the coefficients? To this end, we propose a notion of simultaneous confidence intervals called the sparsified simultaneous confidence intervals. Our intervals are sparse in the sense that some of the intervals' upper and lower bounds are shrunken to zero (i.e., $[0,0]$), indicating the unimportance of the corresponding covariates. These covariates should be excluded from the final model. The rest of the intervals, either containing zero (e.g., $[-1,1]$ or $[0,1]$) or not containing zero (e.g., $[2,3]$), indicate the plausible and significant covariates, respectively. The proposed method can be coupled with various selection procedures, making it ideal for comparing their uncertainty. For the proposed method, we establish desirable asymptotic properties, develop intuitive graphical tools for visualization, and justify its superior performance through simulation and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Gradual Domain Adaptation: Theory and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) adapts a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain in a one-off way. Though widely applied, UDA faces a great challenge whenever the distribution shift between the source and the target is large. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) mitigates this limitation by using intermediate domains to gradually adapt from the source to the target domain. In this work, we first theoretically analyze gradual self-training, a popular GDA algorithm, and provide a significantly improved generalization bound compared with Kumar et al. (2020). Our theoretical analysis leads to an interesting insight: to minimize the generalization error on the target domain, the sequence of intermediate domains should be placed uniformly along the Wasserstein geodesic between the source and target domains. The insight is particularly useful under the situation where intermediate domains are missing or scarce, which is often the case in real-world applications. Based on the insight, we propose $\textbf{G}$enerative Gradual D$\textbf{O}$main $\textbf{A}$daptation with Optimal $\textbf{T}$ransport (GOAT), an algorithmic framework that can generate intermediate domains in a data-dependent way. More concretely, we first generate intermediate domains along the Wasserstein geodesic between two given consecutive domains in a feature space, then apply gradual self-training to adapt the source-trained classifier to the target along the sequence of intermediate domains. Empirically, we demonstrate that our GOAT framework can improve the performance of standard GDA when the given intermediate domains are scarce, significantly broadening the real-world application scenarios of GDA. Our code is available at https://github.com/uiuctml/GOAT.</description>

      <title>Kernel PCA for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Existing works have shown the insufficiency of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) straightforwardly applied on the features of DNNs in detecting OoD data from In-Distribution (InD) data. The failure of PCA suggests that the network features residing in OoD and InD are not well separated by simply proceeding in a linear subspace, which instead can be resolved through proper non-linear mappings. In this work, we leverage the framework of Kernel PCA (KPCA) for OoD detection, and seek suitable non-linear kernels that advocate the separability between InD and OoD data in the subspace spanned by the principal components. Besides, explicit feature mappings induced from the devoted task-specific kernels are adopted so that the KPCA reconstruction error for new test samples can be efficiently obtained with large-scale data. Extensive theoretical and empirical results on multiple OoD data sets and network structures verify the superiority of our KPCA detector in efficiency and efficacy with state-of-the-art detection performance.</description>

      <title>Online Data Augmentation for Forecasting with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning approaches are increasingly used to tackle forecasting tasks involving datasets with multiple univariate time series. A key factor in the successful application of these methods is a large enough training sample size, which is not always available. Synthetic data generation techniques can be applied in these scenarios to augment the dataset. Data augmentation is typically applied offline before training a model. However, when training with mini-batches, some batches may contain a disproportionate number of synthetic samples that do not align well with the original data characteristics. This work introduces an online data augmentation framework that generates synthetic samples during the training of neural networks. By creating synthetic samples for each batch alongside their original counterparts, we maintain a balanced representation between real and synthetic data throughout the training process. This approach fits naturally with the iterative nature of neural network training and eliminates the need to store large augmented datasets. We validated the proposed framework using 3797 time series from 6 benchmark datasets, three neural architectures, and seven synthetic data generation techniques. The experiments suggest that online data augmentation leads to better forecasting performance compared to offline data augmentation or no augmentation approaches. The framework and experiments are publicly available.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how ESG rating disagreement (Dis) affects corporate total factor productivity (TFP) in China based on data of A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2022. We find that Dis reduces TFP, especially in state-owned, non-capital-intensive, low-pollution and high-tech firms, green innovation strengthens the dampening effect of Dis on TFP, and that Dis lowers corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints and weakening human capital. Furthermore, XGBoost regression demonstrates that Dis plays a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP showing that the dampening effect of ESG rating disagreement on TFP is still pronounced in firms with large Dis values.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Majority Vote Learning Algorithms: Direct Minimization of PAC-Bayesian Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PAC-Bayesian framework has significantly advanced the understanding of statistical learning, particularly for majority voting methods. Despite its successes, its application to multi-view learning -- a setting with multiple complementary data representations -- remains underexplored. In this work, we extend PAC-Bayesian theory to multi-view learning, introducing novel generalization bounds based on R\'enyi divergence. These bounds provide an alternative to traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence-based counterparts, leveraging the flexibility of R\'enyi divergence. Furthermore, we propose first- and second-order oracle PAC-Bayesian bounds and extend the C-bound to multi-view settings. To bridge theory and practice, we design efficient self-bounding optimization algorithms that align with our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Summarizing Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture Posterior -- Sliced Optimal Transport Metrics for Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14674v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods to summarize posterior inference for mixture models focus on identifying a point estimate of the implied random partition for clustering, with density estimation as a secondary goal (Wade and Ghahramani, 2018; Dahl et al., 2022). We propose a novel approach for summarizing posterior inference in nonparametric Bayesian mixture models, prioritizing density estimation of the mixing measure (or mixture) as an inference target. One of the key features is the model-agnostic nature of the approach, which remains valid under arbitrarily complex dependence structures in the underlying sampling model. Using a decision-theoretic framework, our method identifies a point estimate by minimizing posterior expected loss. A loss function is defined as a discrepancy between mixing measures. Estimating the mixing measure implies inference on the mixture density and the random partition. Exploiting the discrete nature of the mixing measure, we use a version of sliced Wasserstein distance. We introduce two specific variants for Gaussian mixtures. The first, mixed sliced Wasserstein, applies generalized geodesic projections on the product of the Euclidean space and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. The second, sliced mixture Wasserstein, leverages the linearity of Gaussian mixture measures for efficient projection.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Functional Central Limit Theorems for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at different rates, governed by distinct step sizes, with each update influencing the other. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rates of the error terms for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a property known as decoupled convergence. However, a functional version of this decoupled convergence has not been explored. Our work fills this gap by establishing decoupled functional central limit theorems for two-time-scale SA, offering a more precise characterization of its asymptotic behavior. To achieve these results, we leverage the martingale problem approach and establish tightness as a crucial intermediate step. Furthermore, to address the interdependence between different time scales, we introduce an innovative auxiliary sequence to eliminate the primary influence of the fast-time-scale update on the slow-time-scale update.</description>
