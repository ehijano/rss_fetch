      <title>Too Many or Too Few? Sampling Bounds for Topological Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological descriptors, such as the Euler characteristic function and the persistence diagram, have grown increasingly popular for representing complex data. Recent work showed that a carefully chosen set of these descriptors encodes all of the geometric and topological information about a shape in R^d. In practice, epsilon nets are often used to find samples in one of two extremes. On one hand, making strong geometric assumptions about the shape allows us to choose epsilon small enough (corresponding to a high enough density sample) in order to guarantee a faithful representation, resulting in oversampling. On the other hand, if we choose a larger epsilon in order to allow faster computations, this leads to an incomplete description of the shape and a discretized transform that lacks theoretical guarantees. In this work, we investigate how many directions are really needed to represent geometric simplicial complexes, exploring both synthetic and real-world datasets. We provide constructive proofs that help establish size bounds and an experimental investigation giving insights into the consequences of over- and undersampling.</description>

      <title>In search of the Giant Convex Quadrilateral hidden in the Mountains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $1.5$D terrain is a simple polygon bounded by a line segment $\ell$ and a polygonal chain monotone with respect to the line segment $\ell$. Usually, $\ell$ is chosen aligned to the $x$-axis, and is called the base of the terrain. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a convex quadrilateral of maximum area inside a $1.5$D terrain in $I\!\!R^2$. We present an $O(n^2\log n)$ time algorithm for this problem, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the terrain. Finally, we show that the maximum area axis-parallel rectangle inside the terrain yields a $\frac{1}{2}$ factor approximation result to the maximum area convex quadrilateral problem.</description>

      <title>Linear time small coresets for k-mean clustering of segments with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $k$-means problem for a set $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ segments, aiming to find $k$ centers $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that minimize
  $D(\mathcal{S},X) := \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \min_{x \in X} D(S,x)$, where $D(S,x) := \int_{p \in S} |p - x| dp$
  measures the total distance from each point along a segment to a center. Variants of this problem include handling outliers, employing alternative distance functions such as M-estimators, weighting distances to achieve balanced clustering, or enforcing unique cluster assignments. For any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, an $\varepsilon$-coreset is a weighted subset $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that approximates $D(\mathcal{S},X)$ within a factor of $1 \pm \varepsilon$ for any set of $k$ centers, enabling efficient streaming, distributed, or parallel computation. We propose the first coreset construction that provably handles arbitrary input segments. For constant $k$ and $\varepsilon$, it produces a coreset of size $O(\log^2 n)$ computable in $O(nd)$ time. Experiments, including a real-time video tracking application, demonstrate substantial speedups with minimal loss in clustering accuracy, confirming both the practical efficiency and theoretical guarantees of our method.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Complexity of Earth Mover's Distance under Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Earth Mover's Distance is a popular similarity measure in several branches of computer science. It measures the minimum total edge length of a perfect matching between two point sets. The Earth Mover's Distance under Translation ($\mathrm{EMDuT}$) is a translation-invariant version thereof. It minimizes the Earth Mover's Distance over all translations of one point set.
  For $\mathrm{EMDuT}$ in $\mathbb{R}^1$, we present an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2)$-time algorithm. We also show that this algorithm is nearly optimal by presenting a matching conditional lower bound based on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis. For $\mathrm{EMDuT}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we present an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{2d+2})$-time algorithm for the $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ metric. We show that this dependence on $d$ is asymptotically tight, as an $n^{o(d)}$-time algorithm for $L_1$ or $L_\infty$ would contradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Prior to our work, only approximation algorithms were known for these problems.</description>

      <title>All Polyhedral Manifolds are Connected by a 2-Step Refolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, for any two polyhedral manifolds $\mathcal P,\mathcal Q$, there is a polyhedral manifold $\mathcal I$ such that $\mathcal P,\mathcal I$ share a common unfolding and $\mathcal I,\mathcal Q$ share a common unfolding. In other words, we can unfold $\mathcal P$, refold (glue) that unfolding into $\mathcal I$, unfold $\mathcal I$, and then refold into $\mathcal Q$. Furthermore, if $\mathcal P,\mathcal Q$ have no boundary and can be embedded in 3D (without self-intersection), then so does $\mathcal I$. These results generalize to $n$ given manifolds $\mathcal P_1,\mathcal P_2, \dots, \mathcal P_n$; they all have a common unfolding with the same intermediate manifold $\mathcal I$. Allowing more than two unfold/refold steps, we obtain stronger results for two special cases: for doubly covered convex planar polygons, we achieve that all intermediate polyhedra are planar; and for tree-shaped polycubes, we achieve that all intermediate polyhedra are tree-shaped polycubes.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Spectral Partitioning Works: A Simple Algorithm for Vertex Separators in Special Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that a simple polynomial-time algorithm that we call reweighted spectral partitioning obtains small 2/3-balanced vertex-separators for a number of graph classes, including $O(\sqrt{n})$-sized separators for planar graphs, $O(\min\{(\log g)^2,\log\Delta\}\cdot\sqrt{gn})$-sized separators for genus-$g$ graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, and $O(\min\{\log h,\sqrt{\log\Delta}\}(h\log h\log\log h)\sqrt{n})$-sized separators for $K_h$-minor-free graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$.
  To accomplish this, we first obtain a refined form of a Cheeger-style inequality relating the vertex expansion of a graph and the solution to a semidefinite program defined over the graph. Then, to obtain the guarantees for specific graph classes, we derive direct bounds on the value of the semidefinite program.
  We also obtain several other results of independent interest, including an improved separator theorem for the intersection graphs of $d$-dimensional balls with bounded ply, a new bound on the Fiedler value of genus-$g$ graphs, and a new "spectral" proof of the planar separator theorem.</description>
