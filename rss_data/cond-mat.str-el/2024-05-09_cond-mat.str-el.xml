      <title>Illustrating the Categorical Landau Paradigm in Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the concept of global symmetry extended to non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, for which composition of symmetry generators is not necessarily invertible. Such non-invertible symmetries lead to a generalization of the standard Landau paradigm. In this work we substantiate this framework by providing a (1+1)d lattice model, whose gapped phases and phase transitions can only be explained by symmetry breaking of non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Curvature from the Wave Function I: Schmidt Decomposition and Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher Berry curvature (HBC) is the proposed generalization of Berry curvature to infinitely extended systems. Heuristically HBC captures the flow of local Berry curvature in a system. Here we provide a simple formula for computing the HBC for extended $d = 1$ systems at the level of wave functions using the Schmidt decomposition. We also find a corresponding formula for matrix product states (MPS), and show that for translationally invariant MPS this gives rise to a quantized invariant. We demonstrate our approach with an exactly solvable model and numerical calculations for generic models using iDMRG</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Curvature from the Wave function II: Locally Parameterized States Beyond One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic wave function based approach to construct topological invariants for families of lattice systems that are short-range entangled using local parameter spaces. This construction is particularly suitable when given a family of tensor networks that can be viewed as the ground states of $d$ dimensional lattice systems, for which we construct the closed $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature, which is a generalization of the well known 2-form Berry curvature. Such $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature characterizes a flow of $(d+1)$-form higher Berry curvature in the system. Our construction is equally suitable for constructing other higher pumps, such as the (higher) Thouless pump in the presence of a global on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which corresponds to a closed $d$-form. The cohomology classes of such higher differential forms are topological invariants and are expected to be quantized for short-range entangled states. We illustrate our construction with exactly solvable lattice models that are in nontrivial higher Berry classes in $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Phase from Projected Entangled Pair States in (2+1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider families of invertible many-body quantum states in $d$ spatial dimensions that are parameterized over some parameter space $X$. The space of such families is expected to have topologically distinct sectors classified by the cohomology group $\mathrm{H}^{d+2}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. These topological sectors are distinguished by a topological invariant built from a generalization of the Berry phase, called the higher Berry phase. In the previous work, we introduced a generalized inner product for three one-dimensional many-body quantum states, (``triple inner product''). The higher Berry phase for one-dimensional invertible states can be introduced through the triple inner product and furthermore the topological invariant, which takes its value in $\mathrm{H}^{3}(X;\mathbb{Z})$, can be extracted. In this paper, we introduce an inner product of four two-dimensional invertible quantum many-body states. We use it to measure the topological nontriviality of parameterized families of 2d invertible states. In particular, we define a topological invariant of such families that takes values in $\mathrm{H}^{4}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. Our formalism uses projected entangled pair states (PEPS). We also construct a specific example of non-trivial parameterized families of 2d invertible states parameterized over $\mathbb{R}P^4$ and demonstrate the use of our formula. Applications for symmetry-protected topological phases are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Connection for Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one spatial dimension, families of short-range entangled many-body quantum states, parameterized over some parameter space, can be topologically distinguished and classified by topological invariants built from the higher Berry phase -- a many-body generalization of the Berry phase. Previous works identified the underlying mathematical structure (the gerbe structure) and introduced a multi-wavefunction overlap, a generalization of the inner product in quantum mechanics, which allows for the extraction of the higher Berry phase and topological invariants. In this paper, building on these works, we introduce a connection, the higher Berry connection, for a family of parameterized Matrix Product States (MPS) over a parameter space. We demonstrate the use of our formula for simple non-trivial models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases and Transitions in Spin Chains with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized symmetries often appear in the form of emergent symmetries in low energy effective descriptions of quantum many-body systems. Non-invertible symmetries are a particularly exotic class of generalized symmetries, in that they are implemented by transformations that do not form a group. Such symmetries appear generically in gapless states of quantum matter, constraining the low-energy dynamics. To provide a UV-complete description of such symmetries, it is useful to construct lattice models that respect these symmetries exactly. In this paper, we discuss two families of one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians with finite on-site Hilbert spaces: one with (invertible) $S^{\,}_3$ symmetry and the other with non-invertible $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$ symmetry. Our models are largely analytically tractable and demonstrate all possible spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns of these symmetries. Moreover, we use numerical techniques to study the nature of continuous phase transitions between the different symmetry-breaking gapped phases associated with both symmetries. Both models have self-dual lines, where the models are enriched by so-called intrinsically non-invertible symmetries generated by Kramers-Wannier-like duality transformations. We provide explicit lattice operators that generate these non-invertible self-duality symmetries. We show that the enhanced symmetry at the self-dual lines is described by a 2+1D symmetry-topological-order (SymTO) of type $\mathrm{JK}^{\,}_4\boxtimes \overline{\mathrm{JK}}^{\,}_4$. The condensable algebras of the SymTO determine the allowed gapped and gapless states of the self-dual $S^{\,}_3$-symmetric and $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$-symmetric models.</description>

      <title>Optical Conductivity in Symmetric Mass Generation Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulators are interaction-driven, featureless Mott insulating states in quantum many-body fermionic systems. Recent advancements suggest that zeros in the fermion Green's function could lead to non-vanishing negative optical conductivity in SMG insulators, even below the charge excitation gap. This study explores the origin of this unusual behavior through the lens of pole-zero duality, highlighting a critical issue where the current operator becomes unbounded, rendering the response function unphysical. By employing a lattice model, we derive a well-behaved lattice regularization of the current operator, enabling a detailed study of optical conductivity in SMG insulators. Utilizing both analytical and numerical methods, including strong-coupling expansions, we confirm that SMG insulators exhibit no optical conductivity at low energies below the charge gap, effectively resolving the paradox. This work not only deepens our understanding of quantum many-body phenomena but also lays a robust theoretical groundwork for future experimental explorations of SMG materials.</description>

      <title>Switching between superconductivity and current density waves in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An out-of-plane magnetic field can always suppress superconductivity. In Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), recently observed activation of superconductivity (SC) through either in-plane magnetic fields or proximate spin-orbit coupling (SOC) offers a rare instance of switching superconductivity on. To understand this, we must first examine the non-superconducting state. We propose an incommensurate current density wave (CrDW) driven by van Hove singularities away from the zone corners as a competing order. We note that the two switches, the in-plane field and the SOC, both break spin degeneracy. Our parquet renormalization group analysis reveals that breaking spin degeneracy shifts the balance from CrDW, favored under spin degeneracy, to SC when degeneracy is lifted. Driven by purely repulsive interactions, the pairing symmetry of the resulting SC is $p/d$-wave. The presence of CrDW accounts for the non-linear $I-V$ behavior in the normal state and suggests potential anomalous Hall effects due to time-reversal symmetry breaking. We further predict that reducing screening could enhance SC.</description>

      <title>Interfacial proximity and interplay between Kondo and short-range magnetic correlations in heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of interlayer distance in a heterostructure containing both Kondo effects and short-range magnetic correlations. Our proposed heterostructure comprises three coupled square lattice layers. The first layer is governed by the Kondo-Heisenberg lattice model involving $f$- and $d$-electrons, which interact via Kondo and Heisenberg couplings, $J_{K}$ and $J_{H}$, respectively. The other two layers consist of non-interacting itinerant electrons, where coupling with the first layer is determined by two perpendicular hopping parameters. We find that varying the interlayer couplings induces electronic dynamics at the interface, altering the behavior of mean-field parameters describing the Kondo effect and short-range magnetic correlations. The system's temperature - interlayer hopping parameter phase diagram exhibits a sequence of discontinuous and continuous transitions. In the cases, $|J_{K}|&lt;|J_{H}|$ and $|J_{K}|&gt;|J_{H}|$ rich phase diagrams are found which include Kondo, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations. Our work provides insights into hosting Kondo correlations in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing in the IR limit these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>Nodal Spectral Functions Stabilized by Non-Hermitian Topology of Quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum materials, basic observables such as spectral functions and susceptibilities are determined by Green's functions and their complex quasiparticle spectrum rather than by bare electrons. Even in closed many-body systems, this makes a description in terms of effective non-Hermitian (NH) Bloch Hamiltonians natural and intuitive. Here, we discuss how the abundance and stability of nodal phases is drastically affected by NH topology. While previous work has mostly considered complex degeneracies known as exceptional points as the NH counterpart of nodal points, we propose to relax this assumption by only requiring a crossing of the real part of the complex quasiparticle spectra, which entails a band crossing in the spectral function, i.e. a nodal spectral function. Interestingly, such real crossings are topologically protected by the braiding properties of the complex Bloch bands, and thus generically occur already in one-dimensional systems without symmetry or fine-tuning. We propose and study a microscopic lattice model in which a sublattice-dependent interaction stabilizes nodal spectral functions. Besides the gapless spectrum, we identify non-reciprocal charge transport properties after a local potential quench as a key signature of non-trivial band braiding. Finally, in the limit of zero interaction on one of the sublattices, we find a perfectly ballistic unidirectional mode in a non-integrable environment, reminiscent of a chiral edge state known from quantum Hall phases. Our analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations both in the framework of exact diagonalization and within the conserving second Born approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a quantum Hall interferometer, the dependence of the signal on source-drain voltage is controlled by details of the edge physics, such as the velocities of edge modes and the interaction between them and with screening layers. Such dependence of the signal has been seen in recent experiments at various integer and fractional filling factors, including $\nu=2$ and $\nu=2/5$ where two edge modes are present. Here we study theoretically the current-voltage curves for various values of the relative edge velocities, interaction strength and the temperature, in a model containing two edge modes. We consider separate cases where the inner mode or the outer mode is weakly backscattered at the tunneling contacts. When the inner mode is completely reflected and the outer mode is partially transmitted, we find striking features at very low temperatures related to resonance of excitations of the closed inner channel. Fluctuations in the charge of the closed inner mode, caused by sparse tunneling events, lead to an exponential suppression of the interference visibility at high voltages, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric mutual control in multiferroics, which is the electric control of magnetization, or reciprocally the magnetic control of polarization has attracted much attention because of its possible applications to spintronic devices, multi-bit memories, and so on. While the required working temperature for the practical application is much higher than room temperature, which ensures stable functionality at room temperature, the reported working temperatures were at most around room temperature. Here, we demonstrated magnetic control of ferroelectric polarization at 432 K in ferroelectric and ferroelastic Tb$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$, in which the polarity of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the orthorhombic strain below the transition temperature 432 K. The paramagnetic but strongly magnetoelastic Tb$^{3+}$ magnetic moments enable the magnetic control of ferroelectric and ferroelastic domains; the ferroelectric polarization is controlled depending on whether the magnetic field is applied along [110] or [$\bar{1}$10]. This result may pave a new avenue for designing high-temperature multiferroics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress on the scaling behavior of entanglement entropy, we study the scaling behavior of the number of clusters crossing the boundary between two subsystems for several classical statistical models in two dimension. This number exhibits a subleading logarithmic dependence of the linear dimension of the boundary when the model is at critical, in analogy to the entanglement entropy of a quantum system. It is shown that the logarithmic scaling of the cluster number originates from the conformal invariance of the critical system. We check this numerically for Ising and Ashkin-Teller models by using Monte Carlo simulations, and show that whether a universal coefficient of the logarithmic term can be observed numerically may strongly depend on the geometry and boundary condictions of the system.</description>

      <title>Role of Vanadium-Oxide Layer in Electronic State of Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_{3-\delta}$ with Oxygen Deficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron-based superconductor Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_3$ is composed of alternate stacking of a superconducting FeAs layer and an insulating vanadium-oxide layer with a perovskite-type structure. Electronic orders stemming from the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of V $3d$ electrons can arise in the vanadium-oxide layer, but such orders have not been confirmed so far. Here, we systematically investigate the electronic state of Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_{3-\delta}$ with oxygen deficiency and demonstrate the phase diagram of Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_{3-\delta}$ as a function of the $c$-axis lattice parameter, which has turned out to be a suitable measure of the amount of oxygen deficiency. We found a magnetic and structural anomaly at $\sim 100$ K with a thermal hysteresis, which is manifested with the introduction of oxygen deficiency. The presence of orthorhombic distortion was revealed below the temperature at which the anomaly appears, suggestive of V orbital ordering involving the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. It seems that substantial fluctuations associated with the orthorhombic distortion significantly influence the electronic state of the FeAs layer. Our findings indicate that the vanadium-oxide layer plays a significant role in the electronic state of Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_{3-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Stability of slow Hamiltonian dynamics from Lieb-Robinson bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Quantum Communication and Mixed-State Order in Decohered Symmetry-Protected Topological States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain pure-state symmetry-protected topological orders (SPT) can be used as a resource for transmitting quantum information. Here, we investigate the ability to transmit quantum information using decohered SPT states, and relate this property to the "strange correlation functions" which diagnose quantum many-body orders in these mixed-states. This perspective leads to the identification of a class of quantum channels -- termed symmetry-decoupling channels -- which do not necessarily preserve any weak or strong symmetries of the SPT state, but nevertheless protect quantum many-body order in the decohered mixed-state. We quantify the ability to transmit quantum information in decohered SPT states through the coherent quantum information, whose behavior is generally related to a decoding problem, whereby local measurements in the system are used to attempt to "learn" the symmetry charge of the SPT state before decoherence.</description>

Abstract: Chiral magnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions feature a rich phase diagram with a variety of thermodynamical phases. These include helical and conical spin arrangements and topologically charged objects such as (anti)skyrmions. Crucially, due to hysteresis effects, the thermodynamical phases can co-exist at any given temperature and external magnetic field, typically leading to metastability of, e.g., the material's topological phase. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to study these effects. We compute the relative free energies of co-existing states, enabling us to determine the ground state at all values of the external parameters. We also introduce a method to estimate the activation energy, i.e. the height of the energy barrier that separates the topological phase from the ground state. This is one of the key ingredients for the determination of the skyrmion lifetime, which is relevant for technological applications. Finally, we prescribe predicting the system's evolution through any path in the space of external parameters. This can serve as a guideline to prepare the magnetic material in any desired phase or even trigger a phase transition in an experimental setup.</description>

Abstract: When the material phases exhibit topological quantum numbers, they host defects protected by the nontrivial topology. Magnetic skyrmions are such ``quantized" objects and although many of them are metals they had been most likely treated in theories as purely classical spin states. Here, we show that the electrons described by the Hubbard model with strong spin-orbit couplings can exhibit various nano- or flake-size skyrmions in their ground state. Importantly, the conducting electrons forming Fermi pockets themselves carry textured magnetic moments in both real and momentum space and on top of that, possess Chern numbers in their energy bands. This quantum and conducting skyrmion is related to small skyrmions observed in atomic-layered compounds. We clarify how the effective magnetic interactions and magnetic anisotropies are tied to the spin-orbit coupling, and how they influence the stability of skyrmions beyond the phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Classical Algorithm for the Study of Phase Transitions in the Hubbard Model via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>

Abstract: Simulating quantum many-body systems is believed to be one of the most promising applications of near-term noisy quantum computers. However, in the near term, system size limitation will remain a severe barrier for applications in materials science or strongly correlated systems. A promising avenue of research is to combine many-body physics with machine learning for the classification of distinct phases. In this paper, we propose a workflow that synergizes quantum computing, many-body theory, and quantum machine learning(QML) for studying strongly correlated systems. In particular, it can capture a putative quantum phase transition of the stereotypical strongly correlated system, the Hubbard model. Following the recent proposal of the hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for the two-site dynamical mean-field theory(DMFT), we present a modification that allows the self-consistent solution of the single bath site DMFT. The modified algorithm can easily be generalized for multiple bath sites. This approach is used to generate a database of zero-temperature wavefunctions of the Hubbard model within the DMFT approximation. We then use a QML algorithm to distinguish between the metallic phase and the Mott insulator phase to capture the metal-to-Mott insulator phase transition. We train a quantum convolutional neural network(QCNN) and then utilize the QCNN as a quantum classifier to capture the phase transition region. This work provides a recipe for application to other phase transitions in strongly correlated systems and represents an exciting application of small-scale quantum devices realizable with near-term technology.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions and thermal Hall effect in a noncollinear spin texture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The noncollinear spin textures provide promising avenues to stabilize exotic magnetic phases and excitations. They have attracted vast attention owning to their nontrivial band topology in the past decades. Distinct from the conventional route of involving the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in a honeycomb magnet, the interplay of bond-dependent Kitaev and $\Gamma$ interactions, originating from the spin-orbit coupling and octahedra crystal field in real materials, has demonstrated to be another source to generate noncollinear spin textures with multiple spins in a magnetic unit cell. Notably, earlier works have revealed a triple-meron crystal (TmX) consisting of eighteen spins in the frustrated Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model. Aligning with previous efforts, here we attempt to identify that the TmX hosts several peculiar features with the help of the linear spin-wave theory. To begin with, the symmetric anisotropic exchanges are beneficial for the existence of nonreciprocal magnons, which are stabilized by an external magnetic field. Further, within the regime of TmX, successive topological phase transitions occur, accompanied by the changes of Chern number in value and thermal Hall conductivity in sign. In addition, topological nature of magnons is also verified by the onset of chiral edge modes in a nanoribbon geometry. Our findings pave the way to study topological phenomena of noncollinear spin textures in potential Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast measurements under anisotropic strain reveal near equivalence of competing charge orders in TbTe$_3$</title>

Abstract: We report ultrafast reflectivity measurements of the dynamics of the order parameter of the charge density wave (CDW) in TbTe$_3$ under anisotropic strain. We observe an increase in the frequency of the amplitude mode with increasing tensile strain along the $a$-axis (which drives the lattice into $a&gt;c$, with $a$ and $c$ the lattice constants), and similar behavior for tensile strain along $c$ ($c&gt;a$). This suggests that both strains stabilize the corresponding CDW order and further support the near equivalence of the CDW phases oriented in $a$- and $c$-axis, in spite of the orthorhombic space group. The results were analyzed within the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau framework, which agrees well with the reflectivity dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators, featuring bulk-boundary correspondence, have been realized on a large number of noncrystalline materials, among which amorphous network, quasicrystals and fractal lattices are the most prominent ones. By contrast, topological superconductors beyond the realm of quantum crystals are yet to be harnessed, as their nucleation takes place around a well-defined Fermi surface with a Fermi momentum, the existence of which rests on the underlying translational symmetry. Here we identify a family of noncrystalline Dirac materials, devoid of time-reversal (${\mathcal T}$) and translational symmetries, on which a suitable local or on-site pairing yields topological superconductors. We showcase this outcome on all the above mentioned noncrystalline platforms embedded in a two-dimensional flat space. The resulting noncrystalline topological superconductors possess quantized topological invariants (Bott index and local Chern marker) and harbor robust one-dimensional Majorana edge modes, analogs of ${\mathcal T}$-odd $p+ip$ pairing in noncrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Chiral limit and origin of topological flat bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of zero field fractional quantum Hall analogs in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) asks for a deeper understanding of what mechanisms lead to topological flat bands in two-dimensional heterostructures, and what makes TMDs an excellent platform for topologically ordered phases, surpassing twisted bilayer graphene. To this aim, we explore the chiral limits of massive Dirac theories applicable to $C_3$-symmetric moir\'e materials, and show their relevance for both bilayer graphene and TMD homobilayers. In the latter, the Berry curvature of valence bands leads to relativistic corrections of the moir\'e potential that promote band flattening, and permit a limit with exactly flat bands with nonzero Chern number. The relativistic corrections enter as a \emph{layer-orbit coupling}, analogous to spin-orbit coupling for relativistic Dirac fermions, which we show is non-negligible on the moir\'e scale. The Berry curvature of the TMD monolayers therefore plays an essential role in the flattening of moir\'e Chern bands in these heterostructures.</description>

      <title>A Long Exact Sequence in Symmetry Breaking: order parameter constraints, defect anomaly-matching, and higher Berry phases</title>

Abstract: We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs. In particular, we focus on the localized gapless excitations which sometimes occur at the cores of these objects. These are topologically protected by an 't Hooft anomaly. We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is studied in a companion paper. Our work further develops the theory of higher Berry phase and its bulk-boundary correspondence, and serves as a new computational tool for classifying symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

Abstract: Chiral properties have seen increasing use in recent years, leading to the emerging fields of chiral quantum optics, plasmonics, and phononics. While these fields have achieved manipulation of the chirality of light and lattice vibrations, controlling the chirality of materials on demand has yet remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that linearly polarized phonons can be used to induce geometric chirality in achiral crystals when excited with an ultrashort laser pulse. We show that nonlinear phonon coupling quasistatically displaces the crystal structure along phonon modes that reduce the symmetry of the lattice to that of a chiral point group corresponding to a chiral crystal. By reorienting the polarization of the laser pulse, the two enantiomers can be induced selectively. Therefore, geometric chiral phonons enable the light-induced creation of chiral crystal structures and offer a pathway to engineering chiral electronic states and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Magic in generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic is a property of a quantum state that characterizes its deviation from a stabilizer state, serving as a useful resource for achieving universal quantum computation e.g., within schemes that use Clifford operations. In this work, we study magic, as quantified by the stabilizer Renyi entropy, in a class of models known as generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson systems, i.e., Hamiltonians that allow a stochastic matrix form (SMF) decomposition. The ground state wavefunctions of these systems can be written explicitly throughout their phase diagram, and their properties can be related to associated classical statistical mechanics problems, thereby allowing powerful analytical and numerical approaches that are not usually available in conventional quantum many body settings. As a result, we are able to express the SRE in terms of wave function coefficients that can be understood as a free energy difference of related classical problems. We apply this insight to a range of quantum many body SMF Hamiltonians, which affords us to study numerically the SRE of large high-dimensional systems, and in some cases to obtain analytical results. We observe that the behaviour of the SRE is relatively featureless across quantum phase transitions in these systems, although it is indeed singular (in its first or higher order derivative, depending on the nature of the transition). On the contrary, we find that the maximum of the SRE generically occurs at a cusp away from the quantum critical point, where the derivative suddenly changes sign. Furthermore, we compare the SRE and the logarithm of overlaps with specific stabilizer states, asymptotically realised in the ground state phase diagrams of these systems. We find that they display strikingly similar behaviors, which in turn establish rigorous bounds on the min-relative entropy of magic.</description>

Abstract: We present an expression for the spectral gap, opening up new possibilities for performing and accelerating spectral calculations of quantum many-body systems. We develop and demonstrate one such possibility in the context of tensor network simulations. Our approach requires only minor modifications of the widely used simple update method and is computationally lightweight relative to other approaches. We validate it by computing spectral gaps of the 2D and 3D transverse-field Ising models and find strong agreement with previously reported perturbation theory results.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of logical quantum processors signifies a pivotal moment in the progression from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era to the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era. These advanced devices are poised to alter the approach to problems that challenge classical computation methods. By transforming such problems into Hamiltonian frameworks and exploiting quantum mechanical properties, these processors have the potential to address complex issues within a polynomial computational time. However, despite their advancements, these processors remain vulnerable to disruptive noise, highlighting the need for robust quantum algorithms designed to manage noise effectively. In response to this need, we introduce a new classical-quantum hybrid algorithm termed Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo (QZMC). QZMC is capable of handling device noises and Trotter errors while demonstrating polynomial computational cost. This algorithm combines the quantum Zeno effect with Monte Carlo integration techniques, facilitating multi-step transitions toward targeted eigenstates of the Hamiltonian problem. Notably, QZMC does not require overlap between the initial state and the target state, nor does it depend on variational parameters. It can compute static and dynamic properties of the targeted states, including ground state energy, excited state energies, and Green's functions. Compared to quantum phase estimation, QZMC offers a significantly reduced quantum circuit depth. These features make QZMC an important algorithm for navigating the current transitional phase in quantum computing and beyond.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars with unconventional superconducting pairing symmetries via multi-body interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multi-body interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multi-body interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has a constant interaction energy by cancelling the two-body and multi-body interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). Particularly, the constructed eigenstates have off-site pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum, which leads to superconducting states with either even-parity and spin-triplet or odd-parity and spin-singlet symmetry. We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multi-body interactions has the spin-triplet $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, entanglement entropy, and level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including spin-triplet $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice and spin-singlet $p$-wave pairing states in a one dimensional chain. These findings open up the possibility of realizing nonequilibrium unconventional superconductivity in a long-lived manner protected against thermalization.</description>
