      <title>Delay-Tolerant Networking for Tsunami Evacuation on the Small Island of Hachijojima: A Study of Epidemic and Prophet Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tsunami disasters pose a serious and recurring threat to coastal and island communities. When a large earthquake occurs, people are forced to make evacuation decisions under extreme time pressure, often at the same time as the communication infrastructure is damaged or completely lost. In such circumstances, the familiar channels for sharing information - cellular networks, the internet, and even landlines - can no longer be relied upon. What typically remains are the mobile devices that evacuees carry with them. These devices can form Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), in which messages are forwarded opportunistically whenever people come into contact. To explore this, we evaluate multi-criteria performance characteristics of two DTN routing schemes in a pre-tsunami evacuation scenario for the island of Hachijojima, Japan use case.</description>

      <title>CTMap: LLM-Enabled Connectivity-Aware Path Planning in Millimeter-Wave Digital Twin Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present \textit{CTMAP}, a large language model (LLM) empowered digital twin framework for connectivity-aware route navigation in millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless networks. Conventional navigation tools optimize only distance, time, or cost, overlooking network connectivity degradation caused by signal blockage in dense urban environments. The proposed framework constructs a digital twin of the physical mmWave network using OpenStreetMap, Blender, and NVIDIA Sionna's ray-tracing engine to simulate realistic received signal strength (RSS) maps. A modified Dijkstra algorithm then generates optimal routes that maximize cumulative RSS, forming the training data for instruction-tuned GPT-4-based reasoning. This integration enables semantic route queries such as ``find the strongest-signal path'' and returns connectivity-optimized paths that are interpretable by users and adaptable to real-time environmental updates. Experimental results demonstrate that CTMAP achieves up to a tenfold improvement in cumulative signal strength compared to shortest-distance baselines, while maintaining high path validity. The synergy of digital twin simulation and LLM reasoning establishes a scalable foundation for intelligent, interpretable, and connectivity-driven navigation, advancing the design of AI-empowered 6G mobility systems.</description>

      <title>A-FC: An Activity-Based Delay Tolerant Routing Protocol for Improving Future School Campus Emergency Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: School Campus emergency communication systems are vital for safeguarding student safety during sudden disasters such as typhoons, which frequently cause widespread paralysis of communication infrastructure. Traditional Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) protocols, such as Direct Delivery and First Contact, struggle to maintain reliable connections in such scenarios due to high latency and low delivery rates. This paper proposes the Activity-based First Contact (A-FC) protocol, an innovative routing scheme that leverages real-world social roles to overcome network partitioning by mandatorily uploading messages to highly active "staff nodes". We constructed a real-world evaluation scenario based on the topology of Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School. Simulation results demonstrate that the A-FC protocol significantly outperforms baseline protocols, achieving approximately 68% message delivery probability and reducing average delay to 4311 seconds. With an average hop count of merely 1.68, this protocol establishes a low-cost, highly reliable backup communication model for school campus disaster response.</description>

      <title>Multi-Satellite NOMA-Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA for IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the transition from 5G to 6G unfolds, a substantial increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices is expected, enabling seamless and pervasive connectivity across various applications. Accommodating this surge and meeting the high capacity demands will necessitate the integration of NonTerrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, the extensive coverage area of satellites, relative to terrestrial receivers, will lead to a high density of users attempting to access the channel at the same time, increasing the collision probability. In turn, the deployment of mega constellations make it possible for ground users to be in visibility of more than one satellite at the same time, enabling receiver diversity. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the impact of multi-receivers in scenarios where IoT nodes share the channel following a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol. Considering the impairments of satellite channels, we derive a lower bound of system performance, serving as a fast tool for initial evaluation of network behavior. Additionally, we identify the trade-offs inherent to the network design parameters, with a focus on packet loss rate and energy efficiency. Notably, in the visibility of only one extra satellite as receiver yields significant gains in overall system performance.</description>

      <title>MAESTRO: Multi-Agent Evaluation Suite for Testing, Reliability, and Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MAESTRO, an evaluation suite for the testing, reliability, and observability of LLM-based MAS. MAESTRO standardizes MAS configuration and execution through a unified interface, supports integrating both native and third-party MAS via a repository of examples and lightweight adapters, and exports framework-agnostic execution traces together with system-level signals (e.g., latency, cost, and failures). We instantiate MAESTRO with 12 representative MAS spanning popular agentic frameworks and interaction patterns, and conduct controlled experiments across repeated runs, backend models, and tool configurations. Our case studies show that MAS executions can be structurally stable yet temporally variable, leading to substantial run-to-run variance in performance and reliability. We further find that MAS architecture is the dominant driver of resource profiles, reproducibility, and cost-latency-accuracy trade-off, often outweighing changes in backend models or tool settings. Overall, MAESTRO enables systematic evaluation and provides empirical guidance for designing and optimizing agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Scheduling for TWDM-EPON-Based Fronthaul Without a Dedicated Registration Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures requires fronthaul systems capable of carrying large volumes of radio data while meeting stringent delay and jitter requirements. Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) have emerged as a promising fronthaul solution due to their cost efficiency and compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, the traditional registration process for EPON systems halts the ongoing data transmissions during the registration period, thereby violating the enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) delay and jitter requirements. This limitation has been acknowledged by the ITU-T, which recommends the use of a dedicated wavelength channel for registration, leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling framework for a Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexed (TWDM) EPON-based fronthaul that enables periodic registration without wasting an additional wavelength channel. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves up to a 71\% increase in the number of Radio Units (RUs) supported for a given number of wavelength channels, compared to a baseline scheme employing a dedicated registration wavelength.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement-Learned Unequal Error Protection for Quantized Semantic Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the pressing challenge of preserving semantic meaning in communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.</description>

      <title>{\mu}ACP: A Formal Calculus for Expressive, Resource-Constrained Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00219v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent communication remains a foundational problem in multi-agent systems: protocols such as FIPA-ACL guarantee semantic richness but are intractable for constrained environments, while lightweight IoT protocols achieve efficiency at the expense of expressiveness. This paper presents $\mu$ACP, a formal calculus for expressive agent communication under explicit resource bounds. We formalize the Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model, prove that a minimal four-verb basis \textit{\{PING, TELL, ASK, OBSERVE\}} is suffices to encode finite-state FIPA protocols, and establish tight information-theoretic bounds on message complexity. We further show that $\mu$ACP can implement standard consensus under partial synchrony and crash faults, yielding a constructive coordination framework for edge-native agents. Formal verification in TLA$^{+}$ (model checking) and Coq (mechanized invariants) establishes safety and boundedness, and supports liveness under modeled assumptions. Large-scale system simulations confirm ACP achieves a median end-to-end message latency of 34 ms (95th percentile 104 ms) at scale, outperforming prior agent and IoT protocols under severe resource constraints. The main contribution is a unified calculus that reconciles semantic expressiveness with provable efficiency, providing a rigorous foundation for the next generation of resource-constrained multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Intelligent Low-Altitude Economy Deployments: The O-RAN Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in low-altitude economy (LAE) applications, including UAV-based logistics and emergency response, fundamental challenges remain in orchestrating such missions over complex, signal-constrained environments. These include the absence of real-time, resilient, and context-aware orchestration of aerial nodes with limited integration of artificial intelligence (AI) specialized for LAE missions. This paper introduces an open radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled LAE framework that leverages seamless coordination between the disaggregated RAN architecture, open interfaces, and RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate closed-loop, AI-optimized, and mission-critical LAE operations. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture via a semantic-aware rApp that acts as a terrain interpreter, offering semantic guidance to a reinforcement learning-enabled xApp, which performs real-time trajectory planning for LAE swarm nodes. We survey the capabilities of UAV testbeds that can be leveraged for LAE research, and present critical research challenges and standardization needs.</description>

      <title>On the Error Floor Evaluation of NOMA-Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a simple yet tight analytical approximation of the packet loss rate in the error floor region for a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) scheme. Considering an Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, users randomly select both the number of replicas based on a designed degree distribution and the transmission power from predetermined levels, while successive interference cancellation (SIC) is performed at the receiver. Our derived packet loss rate expression in the finite length regime is promptly evaluated. Its accuracy is validated through Monte-Carlo simulations, demonstrating a strong match across channel loads, including those beyond the low load regime</description>

      <title>Two-Step Interference Cancellation for Energy Saving in Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate a modification of irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) involving intermediate decoding and early transmission termination by some nodes, upon their decoding success. This is meant to avoid unnecessary transmissions, thereby reducing energy consumption. We expect this to be particularly useful at low loads, where most transmissions can be avoided as they do not often result in a collision and are therefore redundant. To validate this proposal, we observe that most of the literature related to IRSA considers an asymptotic heavily loaded regime; thus, we also present a model of energy consumption and success probability for frames of limited length and low offered loads. Thanks to our analysis, also confirmed by simulation, we are able to show that the proposed technique is able to reduce IRSA energy consumption by minimizing transmissions, while preserving performance gains over standard ALOHA. For example, we are able to get a 33% energy saving at offered loads around 10% without affecting throughput.</description>

      <title>NOS-Gate: Queue-Aware Streaming IDS for Consumer Gateways under Timing-Controlled Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timing and burst patterns can leak through encryption, and an adaptive adversary can exploit them. This undermines metadata-only detection in a stand-alone consumer gateway. Therefore, consumer gateways need streaming intrusion detection on encrypted traffic using metadata only, under tight CPU and latency budgets. We present a streaming IDS for stand-alone gateways that instantiates a lightweight two-state unit derived from Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) dynamics per flow, named NOS-Gate. NOS-Gate scores fixed-length windows of metadata features and, under a $K$-of-$M$ persistence rule, triggers a reversible mitigation that temporarily reduces the flow's weight under weighted fair queueing (WFQ). We evaluate NOS-Gate under timing-controlled evasion using an executable 'worlds' benchmark that specifies benign device processes, auditable attacker budgets, contention structure, and packet-level WFQ replay to quantify queue impact. All methods are calibrated label-free via burn-in quantile thresholding. Across multiple reproducible worlds and malicious episodes, at an achieved $0.1%$ false-positive operating point, NOS-Gate attains 0.952 incident recall versus 0.857 for the best baseline in these runs. Under gating, it reduces p99.9 queueing delay and p99.9 collateral delay with a mean scoring cost of ~ 2.09 {\mu}s per flow-window on CPU.</description>

      <title>HFedMoE: Resource-aware Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While federated learning (FL) enables fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) without compromising data privacy, the substantial size of an LLM renders on-device training impractical for resource-constrained clients, such as mobile devices. Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Schwarz Information Criterion Aided Multi-Armed Bandit for Decentralized Resource Allocation in Dynamic LoRa Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a lightweight distributed learning method for transmission parameter selection in Long Range (LoRa) networks that can adapt to dynamic communication environments. In the proposed method, each LoRa End Device (ED) employs the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)1-tuned algorithm to select transmission parameters including channel, transmission power, and bandwidth. The transmission parameters are selected based on the acknowledgment (ACK) feedback returned from the gateway after each transmission and the corresponding transmission energy consumption. Hence, it enables devices to simultaneously optimize transmission success rate and energy efficiency in a fully distributed manner. However, although UCB1-tuned based method is effective under stationary conditions, it suffers from slow adaptation in dynamic environments due to its strong reliance on historical observations. To address this limitation, we integrate the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) to our proposed method. SIC is adopted because it enables low-cost detection of changes in the communication environment, making it suitable for implementation on resource-constrained LoRa EDs. When a change is detected by SIC, the learning history of UCB1-tuned is reset, allowing rapid re-learning under the new conditions. Experimental results using real LoRa devices demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior transmission success rate, energy efficiency, and adaptability compared with the conventional UCB1-tuned algorithm without SIC.</description>
