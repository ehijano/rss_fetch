      <title>The Scaling Behaviors in Achieving High Reliability via Chance-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of resource provisioning under stringent reliability or service level requirements, which arise in applications such as power distribution, emergency response, cloud server provisioning, and regulatory risk management. With chance-constrained optimization serving as a natural starting point for modeling this class of problems, our primary contribution is to characterize how the optimal costs and decisions scale for a generic joint chance-constrained model as the target probability of satisfying the service/reliability constraints approaches its maximal level. Beyond providing insights into the behavior of optimal solutions, our scaling framework has three key algorithmic implications. First, in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) modeling of chance constraints, we show that widely used approaches based on KL-divergences, Wasserstein distances, and moments heavily distort the scaling properties of optimal decisions, leading to exponentially higher costs. In contrast, incorporating marginal distributions or using appropriately chosen f-divergence balls preserves the correct scaling, ensuring decisions remain conservative by at most a constant or logarithmic factor. Second, we leverage the scaling framework to quantify the conservativeness of common inner approximations and propose a simple line search to refine their solutions, yielding near-optimal decisions. Finally, given N data samples, we demonstrate how the scaling framework enables the estimation of approximately Pareto-optimal decisions with constraint violation probabilities significantly smaller than the Omega(1/N)-barrier that arises in the absence of parametric assumptions</description>

      <title>Generative AI Enhanced Financial Risk Management Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06293</link>

Abstract: Risk management in finance involves recognizing, evaluating, and addressing financial risks to maintain stability and ensure regulatory compliance. Extracting relevant insights from extensive regulatory documents is a complex challenge requiring advanced retrieval and language models. This paper introduces RiskData, a dataset specifically curated for finetuning embedding models in risk management, and RiskEmbed, a finetuned embedding model designed to improve retrieval accuracy in financial question-answering systems. The dataset is derived from 94 regulatory guidelines published by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) from 1991 to 2024. We finetune a state-of-the-art sentence BERT embedding model to enhance domain-specific retrieval performance typically for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Experimental results demonstrate that RiskEmbed significantly outperforms general-purpose and financial embedding models, achieving substantial improvements in ranking metrics. By open-sourcing both the dataset and the model, we provide a valuable resource for financial institutions and researchers aiming to develop more accurate and efficient risk management AI solutions.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Barycentre of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback--Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and prove an explicit representation of the Radon--Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, resulting in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints. We propose two deep learning algorithms to approximate the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with an extended application to combine implied volatility smile models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>
