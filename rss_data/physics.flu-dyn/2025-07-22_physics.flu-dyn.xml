      <title>Is memory all you need? Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulence.</description>

      <title>A Taylor swimming sheet under a finite Brinkman layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An asymptotic approach is employed to study the swimming speed of a two-dimensional Taylor swimming sheet beneath a Brinkman layer of finite thickness. This configuration is representative of a swimmer confined within a porous non-Newtonian boundary and could model microscopic filter feeders like choanoflagellates and sponges or the mucociliary escalator in the lungs. When ignoring the effects of jump stress and porosity, the swimming speed of the sheet decreases as the thickness and lower boundary of the Brinkman layer increase. The same is true as the permeability of the layer decreases. Including porosity effects with a zero jump stress enhances the swimming velocity of the sheet for porosity values near unity and decreases the swimming velocity for smaller porosity values. In the absence of porosity, the swimming speed of the sheet increases for positive-valued jump stresses and decreases for negative ones. Coupling nonzero jump stress with a variable porosity establishes complex behavior, with the sheet's swimming speed attaining a maximum, surpassing that found for the Newtonian case, particularly in thin or low-permeability Brinkman layers.</description>

      <title>A Finite Volume and Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization Framework for Benchmarking MHD Flows over Backward-Facing Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic numerical solution of an electrically conducting fluid flow in a backward facing step (BFS) geometry under the influence of an external, uniform magnetic field applied at an angle. The numerical results are obtained utilizing the Finite Volume Method in a collocated grid configuration whereas the resulting system is solved directly using a Newton-like method in contrast to iterative approaches. The computed hydrodynamic results are validated with experimental and numerical studies for an expansion ratio of two. The magnetohydrodynamic case is also validated for Reynolds number $Re=380$ and Stuart number $N=0.1$ with previous numerical studies. Some applications of BFS flow under the influence of a magnetic field include metallurgical processes, cooling of nuclear reactors, plasma confinement, and biomedical applications in arteries. One of the most important findings of this study is the reduction of the reattachment point in contrast to the increase of pressure as the magnitude of the magnetic field is amplified. The magnetic field angle with the greatest influence on fluid flow has been observed to be at an angle of $\varphi = \pi/2$. In several cases, the magnetic field could substantially reduce the main flow vortex leading to a shifted reattachment point.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular rod wake/aerofoil interaction: microphone array and TR-PIV insights via SPOD and beamforming analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the acoustic and velocity fields due to a circular rod and an aerofoil placed in the wake of, and perpendicular to, a rod. Simultaneous measurements were conducted using a microphone array and time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV). The interaction was characterized through acoustic spectra and the coherence between microphone signals and the three velocity components. Coherent structures were identified with Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) using a norm based either on turbulent kinetic energy (SPOD-u) or on pressure (SPOD-p). An advantage of SPOD-p is that it identifies velocity modes associated with a large acoustic energy. Peaks of energy were observed at $\mathit{St} \approx 0.2$ and $0.4$--Strouhal numbers based on rod diameter and free-stream velocity. At $\mathit{St} \approx 0.2$, the dominant feature is von K\'arm\'an vortex shedding from the rod. At $\mathit{St} \approx 0.4$, a wave-train structure in the rod wake impinging on the aerofoil leading edge is captured by the first SPOD-p mode, with coherence levels reaching 60\% for the $u_2$ component (upwash/downwash relative to the aerofoil). This structure also appears at $\mathit{St} \approx 0.2$, but as the second SPOD-p mode. A mode-switching occurs around $\mathit{St} \approx 0.3$: below this value, the first mode corresponds to von K\'arm\'an shedding (cylinder branch), while above it, the first mode tracks the interaction of the aerofoil with the rod wake (aerofoil branch). Both branches were also identified via beamforming using low-rank cross-spectral matrices derived from SPOD-p modes.</description>

      <title>Pixel-Resolved Long-Context Learning for Turbulence at Exascale: Resolving Small-scale Eddies Toward the Viscous Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence plays a crucial role in multiphysics applications, including aerodynamics, fusion, and combustion. Accurately capturing turbulence's multiscale characteristics is essential for reliable predictions of multiphysics interactions, but remains a grand challenge even for exascale supercomputers and advanced deep learning models. The extreme-resolution data required to represent turbulence, ranging from billions to trillions of grid points, pose prohibitive computational costs for models based on architectures like vision transformers. To address this challenge, we introduce a multiscale hierarchical Turbulence Transformer that reduces sequence length from billions to a few millions and a novel RingX sequence parallelism approach that enables scalable long-context learning. We perform scaling and science runs on the Frontier supercomputer. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance up to 1.1 EFLOPS on 32,768 AMD GPUs, with a scaling efficiency of 94%. To our knowledge, this is the first AI model for turbulence that can capture small-scale eddies down to the dissipative range.</description>

      <title>Elastic turbulence hides in the small scales of inertial polymeric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaining a fundamental understanding of turbulent flows of dilute polymer solutions has been a challenging and outstanding problem for a long time. In this letter, we examine homogeneous, isotropic polymeric turbulence at large Reynolds and Deborah numbers through direct numerical simulations. While at the largest scales of the flow inertial turbulence exists, we find that the flow is fundamentally altered from Newtonian turbulence below the Kolmogorov scale. We demonstrate that `Elastic Turbulence' exists at the smallest scales of polymeric turbulence by quantifying multiple statistical properties of the flow - energy spectrum and flux in Fourier space as well as the spatial statistics of the velocity field - the structure functions and kurtosis, and energy dissipation. Our results show the coexistence of two fundamentally distinct types of turbulence in polymeric fluids and point to the ubiquity of elastic turbulence, which was hitherto only known to exist for negligible inertia.</description>

      <title>Noise-Induced Collective Memory in Schooling Fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schooling fish often self-organize into a variety of collective patterns, from polarized schooling to rotational milling. Mathematical models support the emergence of these large-scale patterns from local decentralized interactions, in the absence of individual memory and group leadership. In a popular model where individual fish interact locally following rules of avoidance, alignment, and attraction, the group exhibits collective memory: changes in individual behavior lead to emergent patterns that depend on the group's past configurations. However, the mechanisms driving this collective memory remain obscure. Here, we combine numerical simulations with tools from bifurcation theory to uncover that the transition from milling to schooling in this model is driven by a noisy transcritical bifurcation where the two collective states intersect and exchange stability. We further show that key features of the group dynamics - the bifurcation character, transient milling, and collective memory - can be captured by a phenomenological model of the group polarization. Our findings demonstrate that collective memory arises from a noisy bifurcation rather than from structural bistability, thus resolving a long-standing ambiguity about its origins and contributing fundamental understanding to collective phase transitions in a prevalent model of fish schooling.</description>

      <title>Modeling the dynamics of an oil drop driven by a surface acoustic wave in the underlying substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study, supported by simulations and simple experiments, on the spreading of a silicone oil drop under MHz-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) excitation in the underlying solid substrate. Our time-dependent theoretical model uses the long wave approach and considers interactions between fluid dynamics and acoustic driving. While similar methods have analyzed micron-scale oil and water film dynamics under SAW excitation, acoustic forcing was linked to boundary layer flow, specifically Schlichting and Rayleigh streaming, and acoustic radiation pressure. For the macroscopic drops in this study, acoustic forcing arises from Reynolds stress variations in the liquid due to changes in the intensity of the acoustic field leaking from the SAW beneath the drop and the viscous dissipation of the leaked wave. Contributions from Schlichting and Rayleigh streaming are negligible in this case. Both experiments and simulations show that after an initial phase where the oil drop deforms to accommodate acoustic stress, it accelerates, achieving nearly constant speed over time, leaving a thin wetting layer. Our model indicates that the steady speed of the drop results from the quasi-steady shape of its body. The drop speed depends on drop size and SAW intensity. Its steady shape and speed are further clarified by a simplified traveling wave-type model that highlights various physical effects. Although the agreement between experiment and theory on drop speed is qualitative, the results' trend regarding SAW amplitude variations suggests that the model realistically incorporates the primary physical effects driving drop dynamics.</description>

      <title>Aerosol deposition in mucus-lined ciliated airways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transport and deposition of inhaled aerosols in a mid-generation, mucus-lined lung airway, with the aim of understanding if and how airborne particles can avoid the mucus and deposit on the airway wall -- an outcome that is harmful in case of allergens and pathogens but beneficial in case of aerosolized drugs. We adopt the weighted-residual integral boundary-layer model of Dietze and Ruyer-Quil (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 762, 2015, pp. 68-109) to describe the dynamics of the mucus-air interface, as well as the flow in both phases. The transport of mucus induced by wall-attached cilia is also considered, via a coarse-grained boundary condition at the base of the mucus. We show that the capillary-driven Rayleigh-Plateau instability plays an important role in particle deposition by drawing the mucus into large annular humps and leaving substantial areas of the wall exposed to particles. We find, counter-intuitively, that these mucus-depleted zones enlarge on increasing the mucus volume fraction. Particles spanning a range of sizes (0.1 to 50 microns) are modelled using the Maxey-Riley equation, augmented with Brownian forces. We find a non-monotonic dependence of deposition on size. Small particles diffuse across streamlines due to Brownian motion, while large particles are thrown off streamlines by inertial forces -- particularly when air flows past mucus humps. Intermediate-sized particles are tracer-like and deposit the least. Remarkably, increasing the mucus volume need not increase entrapment: the effect depends on particle-size, because more mucus produces not only deeper humps that intercept inertial particles, but also larger depleted-zones that enable diffusive particles to deposit on the wall.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking machine learning models for predicting aerofoil performance</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the capability of Neural Networks (NNs) as alternatives to the traditional methods to analyse the performance of aerofoils used in the wind and tidal energy industry. The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANSdataset benchmark is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range of aerofoils at 25 angles of attack (4$^\circ$ to 20$^\circ$) to predict fluid flow and calculate lift coefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well during the training phase, but underperformed during testing. Accordingly, this paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested, however whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting the behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate results for calculating $C_L$.</description>
