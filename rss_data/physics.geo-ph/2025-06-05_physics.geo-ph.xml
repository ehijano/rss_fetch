      <title>Velocity determination for time lapse surveys using residual prestack depth migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presented approach aims at estimating the lateral variation of seismic velocities for a seismic timelapse survey. The monitor survey is depth migrated with the known velocity model of the base survey. An analysis is performed to determine whether the moveout to be expected for the monitor survey after residual prestack depth migration (RPSM) can be used for the velocity determination of the formation of interest. In that case the migrated response for the base horizon of the monitor survey is analyzed in order to determine the velocity distribution by employing residual migration concepts. With the use of Fresnel apertures a rather local application is possible at comparatively low signal to noise ratios. The approach is successfully demonstrated for two isotropic depth models both for a lens-like and for a faulted reservoir structures. In both cases the velocities of the monitor survey is recovered accurately. In addition it is demonstrated that an iterative application is possible and that for these two models even severe compaction of the model has little influence on the velocity estimation.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation of Poroelastic Data via Multiscale Mollifiers Wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poroelasticity can be classified with geophysics and describes the interaction between solids deformation and the pore pressure in a porous medium. The investigation of this effect is anywhere interesting where a porous medium and a fluid come together into play, for example this is the case in geothermics. More precisely, it is an important aspect in reservoir management since the replacement of the water in the reservoir some kilometers below the Earth's surface has an effect on the surrounding material and of course displacement of the solid increases or decreases the pore pressure. The underlying physical processes are deduced with the help of linear elasticity, conservation of linear momentum, conservation of mass and Darcy's law. They result in partial differential equations, called the quasistatic equations of poroelasticity (QEP). In this paper, we want to do a multiscale decomposition of the components displacement and pore pressure. This should provide us with more information about the data that means visualize underlying structures in the different decomposition scales that cannot be seen in the whole data. The aim is to detect interfaces and extract more details of the data. For this purpose, we construct physically motivated scaling functions by mollifying the appropriate fundamental solutions. Here we have a closer look at the scaling functions fulfilling the necessary theoretical requirements of an approximate identity. The corresponding wavelets are constructed by subtraction of two consecutive scaling functions.</description>

      <title>Estimating properties of a homogeneous bounded soil using machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full, noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.</description>

      <title>Deformation Due to Non-planar Fault Movement in Fractional Maxwell Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In seismically active regions, the accumulation of geophysical stress during the aseismic period and its impact on faults is crucial for identifying which faults are more likely to undergo future fault movement. In this model, we consider an infinite non-planar fault located in a viscoelastic half-space of a fractional Maxwell medium representing the lithosphere-asthenosphere system comprising three interconnected planar sections. The problem is formulated as a two-dimensional boundary value problem with discontinuities along the fault plane. A numerical solution is obtained using a Laplace transformation, fractional derivative and the correspondence principle. The results have been illustrated graphically using suitable model parameters. The computational findings highlight the significant influence of fault movement and geometry on displacement, stress and strain components in the region surrounding the fault plane. A study has been carried out to investigate how non-planar faults influence displacement and the accumulation of stress and strain. Analysis of these results can provide insights into subsurface deformation and its impact on fault movement, which may contribute to the study of earthquake activity.</description>

      <title>Fault based recurrence models and occurrence probabilities of large earthquakes (M6.0) in the Corinth Rift, Greece</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M6.0 earthquakes recurrence times, Tr, exhibit high variability from 40 to 1500 years, with the southern Corinth Rift fault segments reaching values up to 350 years and their antithetic ones ranging from 400 to 1500 years. The fault segments in the Corinth Rift can be divided into three groups, according to their recurrence behaviour, with some of them exhibiting significantly lower renewal model probabilities than the Poisson model, others showing nearly equal probabilities, and one segment where the renewal model probabilities are much higher than the Poisson one.</description>

      <title>Detailing the stress pattern in the area of central Ionian Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kefalonia Transform Fault Zone (KTFZ) is the most seismically active area in the Mediterranean and consists of two major branches, the Lefkada fault segment to the north and the Kefalonia fault segment to the south. KTFZ acts as an active boundary between the subduction zone of the remnants of the oceanic lithosphere of the Eastern Mediterranean that subducts under the Aegean microplate to the south and the continental collision between the Eurasian plate and the Adriatic Microplate to the north. The tectonic activity in the region is reflected in the rapid crustal deformation rates of the region and subsequently the frequent occurrence of strong earthquakes (Mw&gt;6.0) that occurred during both the historical and instrumental era of seismology. Those strong earthquakes and their temporal distribution can be explained due to stress transfer between closely located fault segments (Papadimitriou, 2002) and as such, studying those stress interactions is an integral part of understanding the long-term tectonic loading in the region.</description>

      <title>Reactive Transport Simulation of Silicate-Rich Shale Rocks when Exposed to CO2 Saturated Brine Under High Pressure and High Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of carbon dioxide storage in shale rocks and the reliability of reactive transport models in achieving accurate replication of the chemo-mechanical interactions and transport processes transpiring in these rocks when subjected to CO2 saturated brine. Owing to the heterogeneity of rocks, experimental testing for adequate deductions and findings, could be an expensive and time-intensive process. Therefore, this study proposes utilization of reactive transport modeling to replicate the pore-scale chemo-mechanical reactions and transport processes occurring in silicate-rich shale rocks in the presence of CO2 saturated brine under high pressure and high temperature. For this study, Crunch Tope has been adopted to simulate a one-dimensional reactive transport model of a Permian rock specimen exposed to the acidic brine at a temperature of 100 {\deg}C and pressure of 12.40 MPa (1800 psi) for a period of 14 and 28 days. The results demonstrated significant dissolution followed by precipitation of quartz rich phases, precipitation and swelling of clay rich phases, and dissolution of feldspar rich phases closer to the acidic brine-rock interface. Moreover, porosity against reaction depth curve showed nearly 1.00% mineral precipitation occur at 14 and 28 days, which is insufficient to completely fill the pore spaces.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>
