      <title>The $O(1/n^{85})$ Asymptotic expansion of OEIS sequence A85</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important sequences in enumerative combinatorics is OEIS sequence A85, the number of involutions of length n. In the Art of Computer Programming, vol. 3, Don Knuth derived the O(1/n) asymptotic formula for these numbers. In this modest tribute to our two heroes, Neil Sloane who just turned 85, and Don Knuth who was 85 a year ago, we go all the way to an $O(1/n^{85})$ asymptotic formula.</description>

      <title>New developments on graph sum index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite simple graph $G=(V,\ E)$, the \emph{sum index} of $G$ is defined to be \begin{align*}
  S(G)=\min\{|\{f(u)+f(v):\ uv\in E\}|:\ f:V\lhook\joinrel\longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}\}. \end{align*} In this paper, from several different aspects, we show some new developments on graph sum index. Firstly, we determine the sum indices of the complete multipartite graphs, hypercubes, and some cluster graphs. Then, we study the maximum number of edges in a graph with a fixed sum index, which is related to the forbidden subgraph problem. Also, we show some relations between graph sum indices and results in additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XVI. Complete bipartite induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16495v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every graph $G$ with a sufficiently large complete bipartite induced minor, either $G$ has an induced minor isomorphic to a large wall, or $G$ contains a large constellation; that is, a complete bipartite induced minor model such that on one side of the bipartition, each branch set is a singleton, and on the other side, each branch set induces a path.
  We further refine this theorem by characterizing the unavoidable induced subgraphs of large constellations as two types of highly structured constellations. These results will be key ingredients in several forthcoming papers of this series.</description>

      <title>On the $r$-th Power Energy of Connected Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $r$-th power energy, also known as $r$-Schatten energy, of connected graphs. We focus on addressing a question posed by Nikiforov regarding whether the $r$-th power energy of a connected graph is greater than or equal to that of the star graph \( S_n \) for \( 1 &lt; r &lt; 2 \). Our main result confirms that, for any connected graph \( G \) of order \( n \), \( \mathcal{E}_r(G) \geq \mathcal{E}_r(S_n) \) for \( 0 &lt; r &lt; 2 \), with equality if and only if \( G \) is the star graph \( S_n \). We derive a Coulson-Jacobs-type formula for the $r$-th power energy of connected graphs and obtain sharper upper bounds for the $r$-th power energy when \( r &gt; 2 \). These results improve previous bounds given by Nikiforov and extend the understanding of graph energies, especially in the range \( 0 &lt; r &lt; 2 \).</description>

      <title>Polynomial Expressions for the Dimensions of the Representations of Symmetric Groups and Restricted Standard Young Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a partition $\lambda$ of a number $k$, it is known that by adding a long line of length $n-k$, the dimension of the associated representation of $S_{n}$ is an integer-valued polynomial of degree $k$ in $n$. We show that its expansion in the binomial basis is bounded by the length of $\lambda$, and that the resulting coefficient of index $h$, with alternating signs, counts the standard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$ in which a given collection of consecutive $h$ numbers lie in increasing rows. We also construct bijections in order to demonstare explicitly that this number is indeed independent of the set of consecutive $h$ numbers used.</description>

      <title>Caterpillars with given degree sequence, small Energy and small Hosoya index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy $En(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. The Hosoya index $Z(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the number of independent edge subsets of $G$, including the empty set. For any given degree sequence $D$, we characterize the caterpillar $\mathcal{S}(D)$ that has the minimum $Z$ and $En$. %and maximum $\sigma$. In $\mathcal{S}(D)$, as we move along the internal path towards the center, large and small degrees alternate. We also compare $\mathcal{S}(D)$ with $\mathcal{S}(Y)$, for a degree sequence $Y$ majorized by a degree sequence $D$. Suppose $Y=(y_1,\dots ,y_n)$ and $D=(d_1,\dots ,d_n)$ are degree sequences such that $Y$ is majorized by $D$ and$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i=\sum_{i=1}^{n}d_i,$$then $Z(\mathcal{S}(D))&lt;Z(\mathcal{S}(Y))$ and $En(\mathcal{S}(D))&lt;En(\mathcal{S}(Y))$.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a discrete homotopy theory and a discrete homology theory for finite posets. In particular, the discrete and classical homotopy groups of finite posets are always isomorphic.
  Moreover, this discrete homology theory is related to the discrete homotopy theory through a discrete analogue of the Hurewicz map.</description>

      <title>Expected Density of Random Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimizer schemes, or just minimizers, are a very important computational primitive in sampling and sketching biological strings. Assuming a fixed alphabet of size $\sigma$, a minimizer is defined by two integers $k,w\ge2$ and a total order $\rho$ on strings of length $k$ (also called $k$-mers). A string is processed by a sliding window algorithm that chooses, in each window of length $w+k-1$, its minimal $k$-mer with respect to $\rho$. A key characteristic of the minimizer is the expected density of chosen $k$-mers among all $k$-mers in a random infinite $\sigma$-ary string. Random minimizers, in which the order $\rho$ is chosen uniformly at random, are often used in applications. However, little is known about their expected density $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ besides the fact that it is close to $\frac{2}{w+1}$ unless $w\gg k$.
  We first show that $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ can be computed in $O(k\sigma^{k+w})$ time. Then we attend to the case $w\le k$ and present a formula that allows one to compute $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ in just $O(w^2)$ time. Further, we describe the behaviour of $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ in this case, establishing the connection between $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$, $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k+1,w)$, and $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w+1)$. In particular, we show that $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)&lt;\frac{2}{w+1}$ (by a tiny margin) unless $w$ is small. We conclude with some partial results and conjectures for the case $w&gt;k$.</description>

      <title>Sequences of odd length in strict partitions II: the $2$-measure and refinements of Euler's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of sequences of odd length in strict partitions (denoted as $\mathrm{sol}$), which plays a pivotal role in the first paper of this series, is investigated in different contexts, both new and old. Namely, we first note a direct link between $\mathrm{sol}$ and the $2$-measure of strict partitions when the partition length is given. This notion of $2$-measure of a partition was introduced quite recently by Andrews, Bhattacharjee, and Dastidar. We establish a $q$-series identity in three ways, one of them features a Franklin-type involuion. Secondly, still with this new partition statistic $\mathrm{sol}$ in mind, we revisit Euler's partition theorem through the lens of Sylvester-Bessenrodt. Two new bivariate refinements of Euler's theorem are established, which involve notions such as MacMahon's 2-modular Ferrers diagram, the Durfee side of partitions, and certain alternating index of partitions that we believe is introduced here for the first time.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies of spanning trees in dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address several related problems on combinatorial discrepancy of trees in a setting introduced by Erd\H{o}s, F\"{u}redi, Loebl and S\'{o}s. Given a fixed tree $T$ on $n$ vertices and an edge-colouring of the complete graph $K_n$, for every colour, we find a copy of $T$ in $K_n$ where the number of edges in that colour significantly exceeds its expected count in a uniformly random embedding. This resolves a problem posed by Erd\H{o}s, F\"{u}redi, Loebl and S\'{o}s by generalising their work from two to many colours. Furthermore, if $T$ has maximum degree $\Delta\leq\epsilon n$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and the edge-colouring of $K_n$ is both balanced and ``not too close'' to one particular instance, we show that, for every colour, there is a copy of $T$ in $K_n$ where that colour appears on linearly more edges than any other colour. Several related examples are provided to demonstrate the necessity of the introduced structural restrictions. Our proofs combine saturation arguments for the existence of particular coloured substructures and analysis of conveniently defined local exchanges.
  Using similar methods, we investigate the existence of copies of a graph $H$ with prescribed number of edges in each colour in $2$-edge-coloured dense host graphs. In particular, for a graph $H$ with bounded maximum degree and balanced $2$-edge-colourings $\mathbf{c}$ of a host graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $(1-\epsilon)n$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we show that, for any sufficiently large $n$ and sufficiently small $\epsilon$, there exists a copy of $H$ where the number of edges in the two colours differ by at most $2$. Moreover, we completely characterise the pairs $(H,\mathbf{c})$ for which the difference of $2$ cannot be improved, refuting a conjecture by Mohr, Pardey, and Rautenbach.</description>

      <title>Stack-sorting with Stacks Avoiding Vincular Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the stack-sorting map $\text{SC}_\sigma$ that sorts, in a right-greedy manner, an input permutation through a stack that avoids some vincular pattern $\sigma$. The stack-sorting maps of Cerbai et al. in which the stack avoids a pattern classically and Defant and Zheng in which the stack avoids a pattern consecutively follow as special cases. We first characterize and enumerate the sorting class $\text{Sort}(\text{SC}_\sigma)$, the set of permutations sorted by $s\circ\text{SC}_\sigma$, for seven length $3$ patterns $\sigma$. We also decide when $\text{Sort}(\text{SC}_\sigma)$ is a permutation class. Next, we compute $\max_{\pi\in \mathfrak S_n}|\text{SC}_\sigma^{-1}(\pi)|$ and characterize the periodic points of $\text{SC}_\sigma$ for several length $3$ patterns $\sigma$. We end with several conjectures and open problems.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for multicolour Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $r$-colour Ramsey number $R_r(k)$ is the minimum $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that every $r$-colouring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$. We prove, for each fixed $r \geqslant 2$, that $$R_r(k) \leqslant e^{-\delta k} r^{rk}$$ for some constant $\delta = \delta(r) &gt; 0$ and all sufficiently large $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For each $r \geqslant 3$, this is the first exponential improvement over the upper bound of Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres from 1935. In the case $r = 2$, it gives a different (and significantly shorter) proof of a recent result of Campos, Griffiths, Morris and Sahasrabudhe.</description>

Abstract: We present algorithms for classifying rational polygons with fixed denominator and number of interior lattice points. Our approach is to first describe maximal polygons and then compute all subpolygons, where we eliminate redundancy by a suitable normal form. Executing our classification, we obtained a dataset of several billions of polygons covering a wide variety of cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16830v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new spanning tree model called the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE), which interpolates between the uniform spanning tree and the minimum spanning tree as the inverse temperature (disorder strength) $\beta$ varies. On the complete graph with $n$ vertices and i.i.d.\ uniform disorder variables on the edges, we identify: (1) a low disorder regime with $\beta \leq C n/\log n$, where the diameter of the random spanning tree is typically of order $n^{1/2}$, the same as for the uniform spanning tree; (2) a high disorder regime with $\beta \geq n^{4/3} \log n$, where the diameter is typically of order $n^{1/3}$, the same as for the minimum spanning tree. We conjecture that for $\beta=n^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (1, 4/3)$, the diameter is of order $n^{\gamma+o(1)}$ for some $\gamma=\gamma(\alpha)$ strictly between $1/2$ and $1/3$.</description>

      <title>Local limits of random spanning trees in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16836v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the edge overlap and local limit of the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) on the complete graph with $n$ vertices and weights given by $\exp(-\beta \omega_e)$ for $\omega_e$ uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. We show that for $\beta$ growing with $\beta = o(n/\log n)$, the edge overlap is $(1+o(1)) \beta$, while for $\beta$ much larger than $n \log^2 n$, the edge overlap is $(1-o(1))n$. Furthermore, there is a transition of the local limit around $\beta = n$. When $\beta = o(n/ \log n)$ the RSTRE locally converges to the same limit as the uniform spanning tree, whereas for $\beta$ larger than $n \log^\lambda n$, where $\lambda = \lambda(n) \rightarrow \infty$ arbitrarily slowly, the local limit of the RSTRE is the same as that of the minimum spanning tree.</description>

      <title>On Functional Dimension and Persistent Pseudodimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any fixed feedforward ReLU neural network architecture, it is well-known that many different parameter settings can determine the same function. It is less well-known that the degree of this redundancy is inhomogeneous across parameter space. In this work, we discuss two locally applicable complexity measures for ReLU network classes and what we know about the relationship between them: (1) the local functional dimension [14, 18], and (2) a local version of VC dimension that we call persistent pseudodimension. The former is easy to compute on finite batches of points; the latter should give local bounds on the generalization gap, which would inform an understanding of the mechanics of the double descent phenomenon [7].</description>

      <title>Classical patterns in Mallows permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical pattern counts in Mallows random permutations with parameters $(n,q_n)$, as $n\to\infty$. We focus on three different regimes for the parameter $q = q_n$. When $n^{3/2}(1-q)\to0$, we use coupling techniques to prove that pattern counts in Mallows random permutations satisfy a central limit theorem with the same asymptotic mean and variance as in uniformly random permutations. When $q\to1$ and $n(1-q)\to\infty$, we use results on the displacements of permutation points to find the order of magnitude of pattern counts. When $q\in(0,1)$ is fixed, we use the regenerative property of the Mallows distribution to compare pattern counts with certain $U$-statistics, and establish central limit theorems. We also construct a specific Mallows process, that is a coupling of Mallows distributions with $q$ ranging from $0$ to $1$, for which the process of pattern counts satisfies a functional central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Trivial coloring of Cartesian product of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coloring of a direct product of graphs is said to be {\em trivial} iff it is induced by some coloring of a factor of the product. A graph $G$ is trivially power colorable iff every coloring of a finite power of $G$ with $\chi(G)$-many colors is trivial.
  Greenwell and Lov\'asz proved that the finite complete graphs $K_n$ for $n\ge 3$ are trivially power colorable. Generalizing their result we define a much wider class of trivially power-colorable graphs: if $G$ is a finite, connected graph with $\chi(G)\ge 3$ and every vertex of $G$ is in a clique of size $\chi(G)$, then $G$ is trivially power-colorable.
  As an application of this result, we give a complete characterization of trivially power-colorable cographs.
  Finally, we give a structural description of the colorings of infinite powers of trivially power-colorable finite graphs.</description>

Abstract: Discrete signatures are invariants computed from time series corresponding to the discretised version of the signature of paths. We study the algebraic varieties arising from their images, the discrete signature varieties. We introduce them and compute their dimension in many cases. From a particular subclass of these varieties, we derive a partial solution to the Chen-Chow theorem for complex-valued time series.</description>

Abstract: We show that for the product of two fixed point free conjugacy classes, the average number of cycles is always very similar. Specifically, our main result is that for a randomly chosen pair of fixed point free permutations of cycle types $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the average number of cycles in their product is between $H_n-3$ and $H_n+1$, where $H_n$ is the harmonic number.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XIII. Basic obstructions in $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs for finite $\mathcal{H}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike minors, the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth come in a large variety, including, for every $t\geq 1$, the $t$-basic obstructions: the graphs $K_{t+1}$ and $K_{t,t}$, along with the subdivisions of the $t$-by-$t$ wall and their line graphs. But this list is far from complete. The simplest example of a ''non-basic'' obstruction is due to Pohoata and Davies (independently). For every $n \geq 1$, they construct certain graphs of treewidth $n$ and with no $3$-basic obstruction as an induced subgraph, which we call $n$-arrays.
  Let us say a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is clean if the only obstructions to bounded treewidth in $\mathcal{G}$ are in fact the basic ones. It follows that a full description of the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth is equivalent to a characterization of all families $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs for which the class of all $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs is clean (a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to any graph in $\mathcal{H}$).
  This remains elusive, but there is an immediate necessary condition: if $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs are clean, then there are only finitely many integers $n\geq 1$ such that there is an $n$-array which is $\mathcal{H}$-free. The above necessary condition is not sufficient in general. However, the situation turns out to be different if $\mathcal{H}$ is finite: we prove that for every finite set $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, the class of all $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs is clean if and only if there is no $\mathcal{H}$-free $n$-array except possibly for finitely many values of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a categorical valuative invariant of polyhedra or matroids, in which alternating sums of numerical invariants are replaced by split exact sequences in an additive category. We provide categorical lifts of a number of valuative invariants of matroids, including the Poincare polynomial, the Chow and augmented Chow polynomials, and certain two-variable extensions of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial and Z-polynomial. These lifts allow us to perform calculations equivariantly with respect to automorphism groups of matroids.</description>

      <title>$C_{2k+1}$-coloring of bounded-diameter graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, in the graph homomorphism problem, denoted by $Hom(H)$, we are given a graph $G$ and we have to determine whether there exists an edge-preserving mapping $\varphi: V(G) \to V(H)$. Note that $Hom(C_3)$, where $C_3$ is the cycle of length $3$, is equivalent to $3$-Coloring. The question whether $3$-Coloring is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs is a well-known open problem. In this paper we study the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem on bounded-diameter graphs for $k\geq 2$, so we consider all other odd cycles than $C_3$. We prove that for $k\geq 2$, the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$(k+1)$ graphs -- note that such a result for $k=1$ would be precisely a polynomial-time algorithm for $3$-Coloring of diameter-$2$ graphs.
  Furthermore, we give subexponential-time algorithms for diameter-$(k+2)$ graphs.
  We complement these results with a lower bound for diameter-$(2k+2)$ graphs -- in this class of graphs the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in subexponential-time, unless the ETH fails.
  Finally, we consider another direction of generalizing $3$-Coloring on diameter-$2$ graphs. We consider other target graphs $H$ than odd cycles but we restrict ourselves to diameter $2$. We show that if $H$ is triangle-free, then $Hom(H)$ is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05542v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given graph $G=(V,E)$, we define its \emph{$n$th subdivision} as the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing every edge by a path of length $n$. We also define the \emph{$m$th power} of $G$ as the graph on vertex set $V$ where we connect every pair of vertices at distance at most $m$ in $G$. In this paper, we study the chromatic number of powers of subdivisions of graphs and resolve the case $m=n$ asymptotically. In particular, our result confirms a conjecture of Mozafari-Nia and Iradmusa in the case $m=n=3$ in a strong sense.</description>

      <title>Necklaces over a group with identity product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address two variants of the classical necklace counting problem from enumerative combinatorics. In both cases, we fix a finite group $\mathcal{G}$ and a positive integer $n$. In the first variant, we count the ``identity-product $n$-necklaces'' -- that is, the orbits of $n$-tuples $\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) \in \mathcal{G}^n$ that satisfy $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n = 1$ under cyclic rotation. In the second, we count the orbits of all $n$-tuples $\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) \in \mathcal{G}^n$ under cyclic rotation and left multiplication (i.e., the operation of $\mathcal{G}$ on $\mathcal{G}^n$ given by $h \cdot \left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) = \left(ha_1, ha_2, \ldots, ha_n\right)$). We prove bijectively that both answers are the same, and express them as a sum over divisors of $n$.
  Consequently, we generalize the first problem to $n$-necklaces whose product of entries lies in a given subset of $\mathcal{G}$ (closed under conjugation), and we connect a particular case to the enumeration of irreducible polynomials over a finite field with given degree and second-highest coefficient $0$.</description>

      <title>A strong structural stability of $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: F\"uredi and Gunderson showed that $ex(n, C_{2k+1})$ is achieved only on $K_{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor, \lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$ if $n\ge 4k-2$. It is natural to study how far a $ C_{2k+1}$-free graph is from being bipartite.Let $T^*(r, n)$ be obtained by adding a suspension $K_{r}$ with $1$ suspension point to $K_{\lfloor\frac{n-r+1}{2}\rfloor, \lceil\frac{n-r+1}{2}\rceil}$. We show that for integers $r, k$ with $3\le r\le 2k-4$ and $n\ge 20(r+2)^2k$, if $G$ is a $C_{2k+1}$-free $n$-vertex graph with $e(G)\ge e(T^*(r, n))$, then $G$ is obtained by adding suspensions to a bipartite graph one by one and the total number of vertices in all suspensions minus intersection points is no more than $r-1$. In other words, $G=B\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^p G_i$, where $B$ is a bipartite graph, $G_1$ is a suspension to $B$, $G_j$ is a suspension to $B\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{j-1} G_i$ for $2\le j\le p$ and $\sum\limits_{i=1}^p \vert V(G_i)-V(G_i)\cap V(B\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{j-1} G_i) \vert\le r-1$. Furthermore, $\sum\limits_{i=1}^p \vert V(G_i)-V(G_i)\cap V(B\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{j-1} G_i) \vert= r-1$ if and only if $G=T^*(r, n)$. Let $d_2(G)=\min\{|T|: T\subseteq V(G), G-T \ \text{is bipartite}\}$ and $\gamma_2(G)=\min\{|E|: E\subseteq E(G), G-E \ \text{is bipartite}\}$. Our structural stability result implies that $d_2(G)\le r-1$ and $\gamma_2(G)\le {\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil \choose 2}+{\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor \choose 2}$ under the same condition, which is a recent result of Ren-Wang-Wang-Yang [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 38 (2024)]. They proved $d_2(G)\le r-1$ and $\gamma_2(G)\le {\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil \choose 2}+{\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor \choose 2}$ separately. We introduce a new concept strong-$2k$-core which is the key that we can give a stronger structural stability result but a simpler proof.</description>

      <title>The hitting time of nice factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the random $u$-uniform hypergraph (or $u$-graph) process on $n$ vertices, where $n$ is divisible by $r&gt;u\ge 2$. It was recently shown that with high probability, as soon as every vertex is covered by a copy of the complete $u$-graph $K_r$, it also contains a $K_r$-factor (RSA, Vol. 65 II, Sept. 2024). The hitting time result is obtained using a process coupling, which is based on the proof of the corresponding sharp threshold result (RSA, Vol. 61 IV, Dec. 2022). The latter, however, was not only derived for complete $u$-graphs, but for a broader class of so-called nice $u$-graphs.
  The purpose of this article is to extend the process coupling for complete $u$-graphs to the full scope of the sharp threshold result: nice $u$-graphs. As a byproduct, we obtain the extension of the hitting time result to nice $u$-graphs. Since the relevant combinatorial bounds in the proof for the $K_r$-case cannot be generalized, we introduce new arguments that do not only apply to nice u-graphs, but will be relevant for the broader class of strictly 1-balanced u-graphs. Further, we show how the remainder of the process coupling for the $K_r$-case can be utilized in a black-box manner for any u-graph. These advances pave the way for future generalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}_{n,d}$ be the class of all functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to[-1,1]$ on the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube of degree at most $d$. In the first part of this paper, we prove that any (deterministic or randomized) algorithm which learns $\mathscr{F}_{n,d}$ with $L_2$-accuracy $\varepsilon$ requires at least $\Omega((1-\sqrt{\varepsilon})2^d\log n)$ queries for large enough $n$, thus establishing the sharpness as $n\to\infty$ of a recent upper bound of Eskenazis and Ivanisvili (2021). To do this, we show that the $L_2$-packing numbers $\mathsf{M}(\mathscr{F}_{n,d},\|\cdot\|_{L_2},\varepsilon)$ of the concept class $\mathscr{F}_{n,d}$ satisfy the two-sided estimate $$c(1-\varepsilon)2^d\log n \leq \log \mathsf{M}(\mathscr{F}_{n,d},\|\cdot\|_{L_2},\varepsilon) \leq \frac{2^{Cd}\log n}{\varepsilon^4}$$ for large enough $n$, where $c, C&gt;0$ are universal constants. In the second part of the paper, we present a logarithmic upper bound for the randomized query complexity of classes of bounded approximate polynomials whose Fourier spectra are concentrated on few subsets. As an application, we prove new estimates for the number of random queries required to learn approximate juntas of a given degree, functions with rapidly decaying Fourier tails and constant depth circuits of given size. Finally, we obtain bounds for the number of queries required to learn the polynomial class $\mathscr{F}_{n,d}$ without error in the query and random example models.</description>

      <title>Almost Ramanujan Expanders from Arbitrary Expanders via Operator Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an efficient algorithm that transforms any bounded degree expander graph into another that achieves almost optimal (namely, near-quadratic, $d \leq 1/\lambda^{2+o(1)}$) trade-off between (any desired) spectral expansion $\lambda$ and degree $d$. Furthermore, the algorithm is local: every vertex can compute its new neighbors as a subset of its original neighborhood of radius $O(\log(1/\lambda))$. The optimal quadratic trade-off is known as the Ramanujan bound, so our construction gives almost Ramanujan expanders from arbitrary expanders.
  The locality of the transformation preserves structural properties of the original graph, and thus has many consequences. Applied to Cayley graphs, our transformation shows that any expanding finite group has almost Ramanujan expanding generators. Similarly, one can obtain almost optimal explicit constructions of quantum expanders, dimension expanders, monotone expanders, etc., from existing (suboptimal) constructions of such objects. Another consequence is a "derandomized" random walk on the original (suboptimal) expander with almost optimal convergence rate. Our transformation also applies when the degree is not bounded or the expansion is not constant.
  We obtain our results by a generalization of Ta-Shma's technique in his breakthrough paper [STOC 2017], used to obtain explicit almost optimal binary codes. Specifically, our spectral amplification extends Ta-Shma's analysis of bias amplification from scalars to matrices of arbitrary dimension in a very natural way. Curiously, while Ta-Shma's explicit bias amplification derandomizes a well-known probabilistic argument (underlying the Gilbert--Varshamov bound), there seems to be no known probabilistic (or other existential) way of achieving our explicit ("high-dimensional") spectral amplification.</description>

      <title>General Capelli-type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Capelli identity is an important determinantal identity of a matrix with noncommutative entries that determines the center of the enveloping algebra of the general linear Lie algebra, and was used by Weyl as a main tool to study irreducible representations in his famous book on classical groups.
  In 1996 Okounkov found higher Capelli identities involving immanants of the generating matrix of $U(gl(n))$ which correspond to arbitrary orthogonal idempotent of the symmetric group. It turns out that Williamson also discovered a general Capelli identity of immanants for $U(gl(n))$ in 1981. In this paper, we use a new method to derive a family of even more general Capelli identities that include the aforementioned Capelli identities as special cases as well as many other Capelli-type identities as corollaries. In particular, we obtain generalized Turnbull's identities for both symmetric and antisymmetric matrices, as well as the generalized Howe-Umeda-Kostant-Sahi identities for antisymmetric matrices which confirm the conjecture of Caracciolo, Sokal, and Sportiello.</description>

      <title>New improvement to Falconer distance set problem in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if a compact set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ has Hausdorff dimension larger than $\frac{d}{2}+\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8d+4}$, where $d\geq 3$, then there is a point $x\in E$ such that the pinned distance set $\Delta_x(E)$ has positive Lebesgue measure. This improves upon bounds of Du-Zhang and Du-Iosevich-Ou-Wang-Zhang in all dimensions $d \ge 3$. We also prove lower bounds for Hausdorff dimension of pinned distance sets when $\dim_H (E) \in (\frac{d}{2} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{8d+4}, \frac{d}{2}+\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8d+4})$, which improves upon bounds of Harris and Wang-Zheng in dimensions $d \ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity-free induced characters of symmetric groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a non-negative integer. Combining algebraic and combinatorial techniques, we investigate for which pairs $(G,\rho)$ of a subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ and an irreducible character $\rho$ of $G$ the induced character $\rho\!\uparrow^{S_n}$ is multiplicity-free. As a result, for $n\geq 66$, we classify all subgroups $G\leq S_n$ which give rise to such a pair. Moreover, for the majority of these groups $G$ we identify all the possible choices of the irreducible character $\rho$, assuming $n\geq 73$.</description>

      <title>Graph Skeletons and Diminishing Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of coarse bottlenecking in graphs and coarse skeletons of graphs and show how bottlenecking guarantees that a skeleton resembles (up to quasi-isometry) the original graph. We show how these tools can be used to simplify the structure of graphs upto quasi-isometry that have an excluded asymptotic minor, reducing it to a skeleton of the original containing no $3$-fat minor. We give an example to show that a similar result does not hold for $2$-fat minors. This makes progress towards a Conjecture posed by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to graph theory, from a geometric and analytic viewpoint. A finite graph $X$ is described by its adjacency matrix $d\in M_N(0,1)$, which can be thought of as being a kind of discrete Laplacian, and we first discuss the basics of graph theory, by using $d$, and various linear algebra tools. Then we discuss the computation of the classical and quantum symmetry groups $G(X)\subset G^+(X)$, which must leave invariant the eigenspaces of $d$, with the quantum symmetry group $G^+(X)$ being in general bigger than the classical symmetry group $G(X)$.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecking in graphs and a coarse Menger-type theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand upon the notion of bottlenecking introduced in our earlier work, characterizing a spectrum of graphs and showing that this naturally extends to a concept of coarse bottlenecking. We show how the notion of bottlenecking provides a different approach to coarsening measures of connectedness than the Coarse Menger Conjecture proposed independently by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu as well as Albrechtsen, Huynh, Jacobs, Knappe, and Wollan - which was recently disproved by a counterexample. We formulate and prove a Coarse Menger-type theorem, and also propose a coarse Erd\H{o}s-Menger-type Conjecture, in the spirit of the Erd\H{o}s-Menger conjecture which was proven after decades by Aharoni and Berger.</description>

      <title>Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields, integral and fractional MDS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields. These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</description>

      <title>Explicit Folded Reed-Solomon and Multiplicity Codes Achieve Relaxed Generalized Singleton Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that explicit FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve relaxed generalized Singleton bounds for list size $L\ge1.$ Specifically, we show the following: (1) FRS code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_q^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ list-decodable (LD) for list size $L\in[s]$. (2) Multiplicity code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_p^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ LD for list size $L\in[s]$.
  Choosing $s=\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $L=O(1/\epsilon)$, our results imply that both FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve LD capacity $1-R-\epsilon$ with optimal list size $O(1/\epsilon)$. This exponentially improves the previous state of the art $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ established by Kopparty et. al. (FOCS 2018) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular, our results on FRS codes fully resolve a open problem proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of $(1-R-\epsilon,O(1/\epsilon))$ LD codes of rate $R$ with poly-sized alphabets.
  Our method can also be extended to analyze the list-recoverability (LR) of FRS codes. We provide a tighter radius upper bound that FRS codes cannot be $(\frac{L+1-\ell}{L+1}(1-\frac{mR}{m-1})+o(1),\ell, L)$ LR where $m=\lceil\log_{\ell}{(L+1)}\rceil$. We conjecture this bound is almost tight when $L+1=\ell^a$ for any $a\in\mathbb{N}^{\ge 2}$. To give some evidences, we show FRS codes are $\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{sR}{s-2},2,3\right)$ LR, which proves the tightness in the smallest non-trivial case. Our bound refutes the possibility that FRS codes could achieve LR capacity $(1-R-\epsilon, \ell, O(\frac{\ell}{\epsilon}))$. This implies an intrinsic separation between LD and LR of FRS codes.</description>

      <title>A general positivity result on tails of certain $q$-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Zhou's method on the positivity of truncated pentagonal number series, we establish a general positivity result on tails of certain $q$-series which uniformly refines the positivity of truncated pentagonal number series, truncated Gauss' identities and some special cases of truncated Jacobi triple product identity. Our proof of the main results is elementary, in which a classical result on partitions of an integer into a finite set of positive integers and the mathematical software such as Maple play important roles.</description>
