      <title>Detecting Misinformation in Multimedia Content through Cross-Modal Entity Consistency: A Dual Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of social media content has evolved significantly, extending from text to multimodal formats. This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection. Our research provides novel methodological and technical insights into multimodal misinformation detection.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Multi-turn Conversation Stance Detection: A Challenge Dataset and Effective Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the proliferation of diverse multimodal social media content including text, and images multimodal stance detection (MSD) has become a crucial research area. However, existing MSD studies have focused on modeling stance within individual text-image pairs, overlooking the multi-party conversational contexts that naturally occur on social media. This limitation stems from a lack of datasets that authentically capture such conversational scenarios, hindering progress in conversational MSD. To address this, we introduce a new multimodal multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset (called MmMtCSD). To derive stances from this challenging dataset, we propose a novel multimodal large language model stance detection framework (MLLM-SD), that learns joint stance representations from textual and visual modalities. Experiments on MmMtCSD show state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MLLM-SD approach for multimodal stance detection. We believe that MmMtCSD will contribute to advancing real-world applications of stance detection research.</description>

      <title>Multi-Reference Generative Face Video Compression with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative face video coding (GFVC) has been demonstrated as a potential approach to low-latency, low bitrate video conferencing. GFVC frameworks achieve an extreme gain in coding efficiency with over 70% bitrate savings when compared to conventional codecs at bitrates below 10kbps. In recent MPEG/JVET standardization efforts, all the information required to reconstruct video sequences using GFVC frameworks are adopted as part of the supplemental enhancement information (SEI) in existing compression pipelines. In light of this development, we aim to address a challenge that has been weakly addressed in prior GFVC frameworks, i.e., reconstruction drift as the distance between the reference and target frames increases. This challenge creates the need to update the reference buffer more frequently by transmitting more Intra-refresh frames, which are the most expensive element of the GFVC bitstream. To overcome this problem, we propose instead multiple reference animation as a robust approach to minimizing reconstruction drift, especially when used in a bi-directional prediction mode. Further, we propose a contrastive learning formulation for multi-reference animation. We observe that using a contrastive learning framework enhances the representation capabilities of the animation generator. The resulting framework, MRDAC (Multi-Reference Deep Animation Codec) can therefore be used to compress longer sequences with fewer reference frames or achieve a significant gain in reconstruction accuracy at comparable bitrates to previous frameworks. Quantitative and qualitative results show significant coding and reconstruction quality gains compared to previous GFVC methods, and more accurate animation quality in presence of large pose and facial expression changes.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Multimedia Mobile Cloud Computing Using Protective Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile cloud computing has been adopted in many multimedia applications, where the resource-constrained mobile device sends multimedia data (e.g., images) to remote cloud servers to request computation-intensive multimedia services (e.g., image recognition). While significantly improving the performance of the mobile applications, the cloud-based mechanism often causes privacy concerns as the multimedia data and services are offloaded from the trusted user device to untrusted cloud servers. Several recent studies have proposed perturbation-based privacy preserving mechanisms, which obfuscate the offloaded multimedia data to eliminate privacy exposures without affecting the functionality of the remote multimedia services. However, the existing privacy protection approaches require the deployment of computation-intensive perturbation generation on the resource-constrained mobile devices. Also, the obfuscated images are typically not compliant with the standard image compression algorithms and suffer from significant bandwidth consumption. In this paper, we develop a novel privacy-preserving multimedia mobile cloud computing framework, namely $PMC^2$, to address the resource and bandwidth challenges. $PMC^2$ employs secure confidential computing in the cloud to deploy the perturbation generator, which addresses the resource challenge while maintaining the privacy. Furthermore, we develop a neural compressor specifically trained to compress the perturbed images in order to address the bandwidth challenge. We implement $PMC^2$ in an end-to-end mobile cloud computing system, based on which our evaluations demonstrate superior latency, power efficiency, and bandwidth consumption achieved by $PMC^2$ while maintaining high accuracy in the target multimedia service.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Multi-instance Visual Sound Localization and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual sound localization is a typical and challenging problem that predicts the location of objects corresponding to the sound source in a video. Previous methods mainly used the audio-visual association between global audio and one-scale visual features to localize sounding objects in each image. Despite their promising performance, they omitted multi-scale visual features of the corresponding image, and they cannot learn discriminative regions compared to ground truths. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-scale multi-instance visual sound localization framework, namely M2VSL, that can directly learn multi-scale semantic features associated with sound sources from the input image to localize sounding objects. Specifically, our M2VSL leverages learnable multi-scale visual features to align audio-visual representations at multi-level locations of the corresponding image. We also introduce a novel multi-scale multi-instance transformer to dynamically aggregate multi-scale cross-modal representations for visual sound localization. We conduct extensive experiments on VGGSound-Instruments, VGG-Sound Sources, and AVSBench benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed M2VSL can achieve state-of-the-art performance on sounding object localization and segmentation.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Modality Fusion Approaches for Audio-Visual Person Identification and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning involves integrating information from various modalities to enhance learning and comprehension. We compare three modality fusion strategies in person identification and verification by processing two modalities: voice and face. In this paper, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed for x-vector extraction from voice, while the pre-trained VGGFace2 network and transfer learning are utilized for face modality. In addition, gammatonegram is used as speech representation in engagement with the Darknet19 pre-trained network. The proposed systems are evaluated using the K-fold cross-validation technique on the 118 speakers of the test set of the VoxCeleb2 dataset. The comparative evaluations are done for single-modality and three proposed multimodal strategies in equal situations. Results demonstrate that the feature fusion strategy of gammatonegram and facial features achieves the highest performance, with an accuracy of 98.37% in the person identification task. However, concatenating facial features with the x-vector reaches 0.62% for EER in verification tasks.</description>

      <title>Spectron: Target Speaker Extraction using Conditional Transformer with Adversarial Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, attention-based transformers have become a de facto standard in many deep learning applications including natural language processing, computer vision, signal processing, etc.. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based end-to-end model to extract a target speaker's speech from a monaural multi-speaker mixed audio signal. Unlike existing speaker extraction methods, we introduce two additional objectives to impose speaker embedding consistency and waveform encoder invertibility and jointly train both speaker encoder and speech separator to better capture the speaker conditional embedding. Furthermore, we leverage a multi-scale discriminator to refine the perceptual quality of the extracted speech. Our experiments show that the use of a dual path transformer in the separator backbone along with proposed training paradigm improves the CNN baseline by $3.12$ dB points. Finally, we compare our approach with recent state-of-the-arts and show that our model outperforms existing methods by $4.1$ dB points on an average without creating additional data dependency.</description>

      <title>Think Twice Before Recognizing: Large Multimodal Models for General Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</description>

      <title>PRoGS: Progressive Rendering of Gaussian Splats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past year, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has received significant attention for its ability to represent 3D scenes in a perceptually accurate manner. However, it can require a substantial amount of storage since each splat's individual data must be stored. While compression techniques offer a potential solution by reducing the memory footprint, they still necessitate retrieving the entire scene before any part of it can be rendered. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for progressively rendering such scenes, aiming to display visible content that closely approximates the final scene as early as possible without loading the entire scene into memory. This approach benefits both on-device rendering applications limited by memory constraints and streaming applications where minimal bandwidth usage is preferred. To achieve this, we approximate the contribution of each Gaussian to the final scene and construct an order of prioritization on their inclusion in the rendering process. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be combined with existing compression methods to progressively render (and stream) 3DGS scenes, optimizing bandwidth usage by focusing on the most important splats within a scene. Overall, our work establishes a foundation for making remotely hosted 3DGS content more quickly accessible to end-users in over-the-top consumption scenarios, with our results showing significant improvements in quality across all metrics compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Resolution Face Recognition via Adaptable Instance-Relation Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-resolution face recognition is a challenging task due to the missing of informative details. Recent approaches based on knowledge distillation have proven that high-resolution clues can well guide low-resolution face recognition via proper knowledge transfer. However, due to the distribution difference between training and testing faces, the learned models often suffer from poor adaptability. To address that, we split the knowledge transfer process into distillation and adaptation steps, and propose an adaptable instance-relation distillation approach to facilitate low-resolution face recognition. In the approach, the student distills knowledge from high-resolution teacher in both instance level and relation level, providing sufficient cross-resolution knowledge transfer. Then, the learned student can be adaptable to recognize low-resolution faces with adaptive batch normalization in inference. In this manner, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution faces can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on low-resolution face recognition clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-World Adverse Weather Image Restoration: Enhancing Clearness and Semantics with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of adverse weather image restoration approaches trained on synthetic data when applied to real-world scenarios. We formulate a semi-supervised learning framework employing vision-language models to enhance restoration performance across diverse adverse weather conditions in real-world settings. Our approach involves assessing image clearness and providing semantics using vision-language models on real data, serving as supervision signals for training restoration models. For clearness enhancement, we use real-world data, utilizing a dual-step strategy with pseudo-labels assessed by vision-language models and weather prompt learning. For semantic enhancement, we integrate real-world data by adjusting weather conditions in vision-language model descriptions while preserving semantic meaning. Additionally, we introduce an effective training strategy to bootstrap restoration performance. Our approach achieves superior results in real-world adverse weather image restoration, demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art works.</description>

Abstract: Shadows are formed when light encounters obstacles, leading to areas of diminished illumination. In computer vision, shadow detection, removal, and generation are crucial for enhancing scene understanding, refining image quality, ensuring visual consistency in video editing, and improving virtual environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of shadow detection, removal, and generation in images and videos within the deep learning landscape over the past decade, covering tasks, deep models, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Our key contributions include a comprehensive survey of shadow analysis, standardization of experimental comparisons, exploration of the relationships among model size, speed, and performance, a cross-dataset generalization study, identification of open issues and future directions, and provision of publicly available resources to support further research.</description>

      <title>Palantir: Towards Efficient Super Resolution for Ultra-high-definition Live Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural enhancement through super-resolution (SR) deep neural networks (DNNs) opens up new possibilities for ultra-high-definition (UHD) live streaming over existing encoding and networking infrastructure. Yet, the heavy SR DNN inference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the overhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on carefully selected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight reusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained and fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the first neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level scheduling. Two novel techniques are incorporated into Palantir to select the most beneficial anchor patches and support latency-sensitive UHD live streaming applications. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical analysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight yet accurate SR quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set. Secondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves parallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation process into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation.
  The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling latency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement. When compared to the naive method of applying DNN-based SR on all the frames, Palantir can reduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 20 times (or 60 times) while preserving 54.0-82.6% (or 32.8-64.0%) of the quality gain. When compared to the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir can reduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average) without sacrificing the video quality.</description>

      <title>MCDubber: Multimodal Context-Aware Expressive Video Dubbing</title>

Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) aims to take the given script and generate speech that aligns with lip motion and prosody expressiveness. Current AVD models mainly utilize visual information of the current sentence to enhance the prosody of synthesized speech. However, it is crucial to consider whether the prosody of the generated dubbing aligns with the multimodal context, as the dubbing will be combined with the original context in the final video. This aspect has been overlooked in previous studies. To address this issue, we propose a Multimodal Context-aware video Dubbing model, termed \textbf{MCDubber}, to convert the modeling object from a single sentence to a longer sequence with context information to ensure the consistency of the global context prosody. MCDubber comprises three main components: (1) A context duration aligner aims to learn the context-aware alignment between the text and lip frames; (2) A context prosody predictor seeks to read the global context visual sequence and predict the context-aware global energy and pitch; (3) A context acoustic decoder ultimately predicts the global context mel-spectrogram with the assistance of adjacent ground-truth mel-spectrograms of the target sentence. Through this process, MCDubber fully considers the influence of multimodal context on the prosody expressiveness of the current sentence when dubbing. The extracted mel-spectrogram belonging to the target sentence from the output context mel-spectrograms is the final required dubbing audio. Extensive experiments on the Chem benchmark dataset demonstrate that our MCDubber significantly improves dubbing expressiveness compared to all advanced baselines. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/XiaoYuanJun-zy/MCDubber.</description>

      <title>Inter-Frame Compression for Dynamic Point Cloud Geometry Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient point cloud compression is essential for applications like virtual and mixed reality, autonomous driving, and cultural heritage. This paper proposes a deep learning-based inter-frame encoding scheme for dynamic point cloud geometry compression. We propose a lossy geometry compression scheme that predicts the latent representation of the current frame using the previous frame by employing a novel feature space inter-prediction network. The proposed network utilizes sparse convolutions with hierarchical multiscale 3D feature learning to encode the current frame using the previous frame. The proposed method introduces a novel predictor network for motion compensation in the feature domain to map the latent representation of the previous frame to the coordinates of the current frame to predict the current frame's feature embedding. The framework transmits the residual of the predicted features and the actual features by compressing them using a learned probabilistic factorized entropy model. At the receiver, the decoder hierarchically reconstructs the current frame by progressively rescaling the feature embedding. The proposed framework is compared to the state-of-the-art Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC) and Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) schemes standardized by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). The proposed method achieves more than 88% BD-Rate (Bjontegaard Delta Rate) reduction against G-PCCv20 Octree, more than 56% BD-Rate savings against G-PCCv20 Trisoup, more than 62% BD-Rate reduction against V-PCC intra-frame encoding mode, and more than 52% BD-Rate savings against V-PCC P-frame-based inter-frame encoding mode using HEVC. These significant performance gains are cross-checked and verified in the MPEG working group.</description>

      <title>Show Me the World in My Language: Establishing the First Baseline for Scene-Text to Scene-Text Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the task of ``visually'' translating scene text from a source language (e.g., Hindi) to a target language (e.g., English). Visual translation involves not just the recognition and translation of scene text but also the generation of the translated image that preserves visual features of the source scene text, such as font, size, and background. There are several challenges associated with this task, such as translation with limited context, deciding between translation and transliteration, accommodating varying text lengths within fixed spatial boundaries, and preserving the font and background styles of the source scene text in the target language. To address this problem, we make the following contributions: (i) We study visual translation as a standalone problem for the first time in the literature. (ii) We present a cascaded framework for visual translation that combines state-of-the-art modules for scene text recognition, machine translation, and scene text synthesis as a baseline for the task. (iii) We propose a set of task-specific design enhancements to design a variant of the baseline to obtain performance improvements. (iv) Currently, the existing related literature lacks any comprehensive performance evaluation for this novel task. To fill this gap, we introduce several automatic and user-assisted evaluation metrics designed explicitly for evaluating visual translation. Further, we evaluate presented baselines for translating scene text between Hindi and English. Our experiments demonstrate that although we can effectively perform visual translation over a large collection of scene text images, the presented baseline only partially addresses challenges posed by visual translation tasks. We firmly believe that this new task and the limitations of existing models, as reported in this paper, should encourage further research in visual translation.</description>

      <title>TALDS-Net: Task-Aware Adaptive Local Descriptors Selection for Few-shot Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot image classification aims to classify images from unseen novel classes with few samples. Recent works demonstrate that deep local descriptors exhibit enhanced representational capabilities compared to image-level features. However, most existing methods solely rely on either employing all local descriptors or directly utilizing partial descriptors, potentially resulting in the loss of crucial information. Moreover, these methods primarily emphasize the selection of query descriptors while overlooking support descriptors. In this paper, we propose a novel Task-Aware Adaptive Local Descriptors Selection Network (TALDS-Net), which exhibits the capacity for adaptive selection of task-aware support descriptors and query descriptors. Specifically, we compare the similarity of each local support descriptor with other local support descriptors to obtain the optimal support descriptor subset and then compare the query descriptors with the optimal support subset to obtain discriminative query descriptors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TALDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both general and fine-grained datasets.</description>
