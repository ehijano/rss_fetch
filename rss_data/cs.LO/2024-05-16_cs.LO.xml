      <title>Localized Attractor Computations for Infinite-State Games (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite-state games are a commonly used model for the synthesis of reactive systems with unbounded data domains. Symbolic methods for solving such games need to be able to construct intricate arguments to establish the existence of winning strategies. Often, large problem instances require prohibitively complex arguments. Therefore, techniques that identify smaller and simpler sub-problems and exploit the respective results for the given game-solving task are highly desirable. In this paper, we propose the first such technique for infinite-state games. The main idea is to enhance symbolic game-solving with the results of localized attractor computations performed in sub-games. The crux of our approach lies in identifying useful sub-games by computing permissive winning strategy templates in finite abstractions of the infinite-state game. The experimental evaluation of our method demonstrates that it outperforms existing techniques and is applicable to infinite-state games beyond the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Initial Algebras Unchained -- A Novel Initial Algebra Construction Formalized in Agda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial algebra for an endofunctor F provides a recursion and induction scheme for data structures whose constructors are described by F. The initial-algebra construction by Ad\'amek (1974) starts with the initial object (e.g. the empty set) and successively applies the functor until a fixed point is reached, an idea inspired by Kleene's fixed point theorem. Depending on the functor of interest, this may require transfinitely many steps indexed by ordinal numbers until termination.
  We provide a new initial algebra construction which is not based on an ordinal-indexed chain. Instead, our construction is loosely inspired by Pataraia's fixed point theorem and forms the colimit of all finite recursive coalgebras. This is reminiscent of the construction of the rational fixed point of an endofunctor that forms the colimit of all finite coalgebras. For our main correctness theorem, we assume the given endofunctor is accessible on a (weak form of) locally presentable category. Our proofs are constructive and fully formalized in Agda.</description>

      <title>HepLean: Digitalising high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce HepLean, an open-source project to digitalise definitions, theorems, proofs, and calculations in high energy physics using the interactive theorem prover Lean 4. HepLean has the potential to benefit the high energy physics community in four ways: making it easier to find existing results, allowing the creation of new results using artificial intelligence and automated methods, allowing easy review of papers for mathematical correctness, and providing new ways to teach high energy physics. We will discuss these in detail. We will also demonstrate the digitalisation of three areas of high energy physics in HepLean: Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrices in flavour physics, local anomaly cancellation, and Higgs physics.</description>

      <title>First order distinguishability of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of distinguishing between two independent samples $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ of a binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ by first order (FO) sentences. Shelah and Spencer proved that, for a constant $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $G(n,n^{-\alpha})$ obeys FO zero-one law if and only if $\alpha$ is irrational. Therefore, for irrational $\alpha\in(0,1)$, any fixed FO sentence does not distinguish between $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ with asymptotical probability 1 (w.h.p.) as $n\to\infty$. We show that the minimum quantifier depth $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}$ of a FO sentence $\varphi=\varphi(\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2)$ distinguishing between $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ depends on how closely $\alpha$ can be approximated by rationals: (1) for all non-Liouville $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}=\Omega(\ln\ln\ln n)$ w.h.p.; (2) there are irrational $\alpha\in(0,1)$ with $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}$ that grow arbitrarily slowly w.h.p.; (3) $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}=O_p(\frac{\ln n}{\ln\ln n})$ for all $\alpha\in(0,1)$. The main ingredients in our proofs are a novel randomized algorithm that generates asymmetric strictly balanced graphs as well as a new method to study symmetry groups of randomly perturbed graphs.</description>

      <title>Completeness and Termination of Tableau Calculus for Undirected Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid logic is a modal logic with additional operators specifying nominals and is highly expressive. For example, there is no formula corresponding to the irreflexivity of Kripke frames in basic modal logic, but there is in hybrid logic. Irreflexivity is significant in that irreflexive and symmetric Kripke frames can be regarded as undirected graphs reviewed from a graph theoretic point of view. Thus, the study of the hybrid logic with axioms corresponding to irreflexivity and symmetry can help to elucidate the logical properties of undirected graphs. In this paper, we formulate the tableau method of the hybrid logic for undirected graphs. Our main result is to show the completeness theorem and the termination property of the tableau method, which leads us to prove the decidability.</description>

      <title>Compositional imprecise probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imprecise probability is concerned with uncertainty about which probability distributions to use. It has applications in robust statistics and elsewhere. Imprecise probability can be modelled in various ways, including by convex sets of probability distributions.
  We look at programming language models for imprecise probability. Our desiderata are that we would like our model to support all kinds of composition, categorical and monoidal, in other words, guided by dataflow diagrams. Another equivalent perspective is that we would like a model of synthetic probability in the sense of Markov categories.
  There is already a fairly popular monad-based approach to imprecise probability, but it is not fully compositional because the monad involved is not commutative, which means that we do not have a proper monoidal structure. In this work, we provide a new fully compositional account. The key idea is to name the non-deterministic choices. To manage the renamings and disjointness of names, we use graded monads. We show that the resulting compositional model is maximal. We relate with the earlier monad approach, showing that we obtain tighter bounds on the uncertainty.</description>

      <title>$O_2$ is a multiple context-free grammar: an implementation-, formalisation-friendly proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying formal languages according to the expressiveness of grammars able to generate them is a fundamental problem in computational linguistics and, therefore, in the theory of computation. Furthermore, such kind of analysis can give insight into the classification of abstract algebraic structure such as groups, for example through the correspondence given by the word problem. While many such classification problems remain open, others have been settled. Recently, it was proved that $n$-balanced languages (i.e., whose strings contain the same occurrences of letters $a_i$ and $A_i$ with $1\leq i \leq n$) can be generated by multiple context-free grammars (MCFGs), which are one of the several slight extensions of context free grammars added to the classical Chomsky hierarchy to make the mentioned classification more precise. This paper analyses the existing proofs from the computational and the proof-theoretical point of views, systematically studying whether each proof can lead to a verified (i.e., checked by a proof assistant) algorithm parsing balanced languages via MCFGs. We conclude that none of the existing proofs is realistically suitable against this practical goal, and proceed to provide a radically new, elementary, extremely short proof for the crucial case $n \leq 2$. A comparative analysis with respect to the existing proofs is finally performed to justify why the proposed proof is a substantial step towards concretely obtaining a verified parsing algorithm for $O_2$.</description>

      <title>On Tools for Completeness of Kleene Algebra with Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13020v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature on Kleene algebra, a number of variants have been proposed which impose additional structure specified by a theory, such as Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) and the recent Kleene algebra with observations (KAO), or make specific assumptions about certain constants, as for instance in NetKAT. Many of these variants fit within the unifying perspective offered by Kleene algebra with hypotheses, which comes with a canonical language model constructed from a given set of hypotheses. For the case of KAT, this model corresponds to the familiar interpretation of expressions as languages of guarded strings. A relevant question therefore is whether Kleene algebra together with a given set of hypotheses is complete with respect to its canonical language model. In this paper, we revisit, combine and extend existing results on this question to obtain tools for proving completeness in a modular way. We showcase these tools by giving new and modular proofs of completeness for KAT, KAO and NetKAT, and we prove completeness for new variants of KAT: KAT extended with a constant for the full relation, KAT extended with a converse operation, and a version of KAT where the collection of tests only forms a distributive lattice.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Many Valued Logic Systems in Theoretical Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is an original attempt to understand the foundations of economic reasoning. It endeavors to rigorously define the relationship between subjective interpretations and objective valuations of such interpretations in the context of theoretical economics. This analysis is substantially expanded through a dynamic approach, where the truth of a valuation results in an updated interpretation or changes in the agent's subjective belief regarding the effectiveness of the selected action as well as the objective reality of the effectiveness of all other possible actions (i.e. consequence realization). Complications arise when the economic agent is presented with a set of actions that render ambiguous preference, or when the effectiveness of an action cannot be perceived upon its selection, thereby necessitating a different theory of choice and consequence realization.</description>

      <title>IMELL Cut Elimination with Linear Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Accattoli introduced the Exponential Substitution Calculus (ESC) given by untyped proof terms for Intuitionistic Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic (IMELL), endowed with rewriting rules at-a-distance for cut elimination. He also introduced a new cut elimination strategy, dubbed the good strategy, and showed that its number of steps is a time cost model with polynomial overhead for the ESC/IMELL, and the first such one.
  Here, we refine Accattoli's result by introducing an abstract machine for ESC and proving that it implements the good strategy and computes cut-free terms/proofs within a linear overhead.</description>

      <title>TLINet: Differentiable Neural Network Temporal Logic Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in extracting formal descriptions of the system behaviors from data. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is an expressive formal language used to describe spatial-temporal properties with interpretability. This paper introduces TLINet, a neural-symbolic framework for learning STL formulas. The computation in TLINet is differentiable, enabling the usage of off-the-shelf gradient-based tools during the learning process. In contrast to existing approaches, we introduce approximation methods for max operator designed specifically for temporal logic-based gradient techniques, ensuring the correctness of STL satisfaction evaluation. Our framework not only learns the structure but also the parameters of STL formulas, allowing flexible combinations of operators and various logical structures. We validate TLINet against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that our approach outperforms these baselines in terms of interpretability, compactness, rich expressibility, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Policies for Uncertain Parametric Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthesising verifiably correct controllers for dynamical systems is crucial for safety-critical problems. To achieve this, it is important to account for uncertainty in a robust manner, while at the same time it is often of interest to avoid being overly conservative with the view of achieving a better cost. We propose a method for verifiably safe policy synthesis for a class of finite state models, under the presence of structural uncertainty. In particular, we consider uncertain parametric Markov decision processes (upMDPs), a special class of Markov decision processes, with parameterised transition functions, where such parameters are drawn from a (potentially) unknown distribution. Our framework leverages recent advancements in the so-called scenario approach theory, where we represent the uncertainty by means of scenarios, and provide guarantees on synthesised policies satisfying probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) formulae. We consider several common benchmarks/problems and compare our work to recent developments for verifying upMDPs.</description>
