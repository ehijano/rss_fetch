      <title>3D Guard-Layer: An Integrated Agentic AI Safety System for Edge Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI systems have found a wide range of real-world applications in recent years. The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead.</description>

      <title>FsimNNs: An Open-Source Graph Neural Network Platform for SEU Simulation-based Fault Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based fault injection is a widely adopted methodology for assessing circuit vulnerability to Single Event Upsets (SEUs); however, its computational cost grows significantly with circuit complexity. To address this limitation, this work introduces an open-source platform that exploits Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to accelerate SEU fault simulation. The platform includes three STGNN architectures incorporating advanced components such as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and attention mechanisms, thereby improving spatio-temporal feature extraction. In addition, SEU fault simulation datasets are constructed from six open-source circuits with varying levels of complexity, providing a comprehensive benchmark for performance evaluation. The predictive capability of the STGNN models is analyzed and compared on these datasets. Moreover, to further investigate the efficiency of the approach, we evaluate the predictive capability of STGNNs across multiple test cases and discuss their generalization capability. The developed platform and datasets are released as open-source to support reproducibility and further research on https://github.com/luli2021/FsimNNs.</description>

      <title>P3-LLM: An Integrated NPU-PIM Accelerator for LLM Inference Using Hybrid Numerical Formats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demands of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator for P3-LLM, featuring enhanced compute units to support hybrid numerical formats. Our careful choice of numerical formats allows to co-design low-precision PIM compute units that significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in terms of both KV-cache quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\times$, $2.0\times$, and $3.4\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively. Our quantization code is available at https://github.com/yc2367/P3-LLM.git</description>
