      <title>On the Image Profiles of Transients in the Palomar Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VASCO project has discovered groups of short-lived transients on historical photographic plates that lack conventional explanation. Hambly &amp; Blair (2024) examined nine such transients reported by Villarroel (2021) and found that they exhibit narrower, rounder profiles, attributing this to emulsion flaws. However, well-established optical principles and atmospheric physics imply that unresolved flashes lasting less than a second naturally appear sharper and more circular than stellar images, particularly on long-exposure plates where stars are significantly blurred by seeing and tracking errors. Such profiles are an expected consequence of sub-second optical flashes, making their findings consistent with the transient interpretation.</description>

      <title>Hidden binaries in star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems. For Solar-mass stars in the Galactic field, the distribution of orbital separations is log-normal over seven orders of magnitude, from $10^{-2} - 10^5$ au. In contrast, the separation distributions of systems in nearby star-forming regions paints a much more confusing picture. There appears to be an excess of systems in the separation range 10 - 1000 au, and recent high-resolution spectroscopic observations of close (&lt;10 au) systems suggest a field-like distribution in some star-forming regions, but a possible excess with respect to the field in other regions. Furthermore, the resolution limit of numerical simulations of binary star formation is $\sim$1\,au, and consequently comparisons with the binary distributions in star-forming regions and in the field are restricted. In this paper, we demonstrate that these observational uncertainties, and limitations in the simulations, are potentially a much bigger problem than previously realised. We show that the log-normal separation distribution in the field can be reproduced by combining constituent binary populations whose initial separation distributions have a very different form to a log-normal. We also argue that the observed excess of binaries in the range 10 - 62 au in the ONC compared to the Galactic field is not necessarily inconsistent with the field population, because the ONC is only one of many star-forming regions that populate the field. We propose that further observations of spectroscopic binaries in star-forming regions to probe and complete the &lt;10 au parameter space are urgently needed.</description>

      <title>Orbital and Physical Properties of the Pleiades Binary 27 Tau (Atlas)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new spectroscopic and interferometric observations of the Pleiades binary star Atlas, which played an important role nearly three decades ago in settling the debate over the distance to the cluster from ground-based and space-based determinations. We use the new measurements, together with other published and archival astrometric observations, to improve the determination of the 291-day orbit and the distance to Atlas ($136.2 \pm 1.4$ pc). We also derive the main properties of the components, including their absolute masses ($5.04 \pm 0.17 M_{\odot}$ and $3.64 \pm 0.12 M_{\odot}$), sizes, effective temperatures, projected rotational velocities, and chemical composition. We find that the more evolved primary star is rotationally distorted, and are able to estimate its oblateness and the approximate orientation of its spin axis from the interferometric observations. The spin axis may well be aligned with the orbital axis. Models of stellar evolution from MESA that account for rotation provide a good match to all of the primary's global properties, and point to an initial angular rotation rate on the zero-age main sequence of about 55% of the breakup velocity. The current location of the star in the H-R diagram is near the very end of the hydrogen-burning main sequence, at an age of about 105 Myr, according to these models. Our spectroscopic analysis of the more slowly-rotating secondary indicates that it is a helium-weak star, with other chemical anomalies.</description>

      <title>Carbon burning cannot explain puffy hypervelocity white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant formation channel of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has been extensively studied for many years. Several hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) with space velocities of $\gtrsim 1000\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ have recently been discovered. One possible origin of these stars is the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) scenario, in which an accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD detonates as a SN Ia. In this scenario, the less massive WD may survive its companion's detonation and be ejected as a HVWD. Most of the observed HVWDs are hotter and puffier than normal WDs, perhaps due to their recent proximity to a SN. In this work, we test whether these properties can be explained by long-lived stable carbon (C) burning in the interiors of CO WD donors triggered by a SN shock. We model the long-term evolution of CO WDs following rapid energy injection using 1D models. We find that stable C burning can be ignited in CO WDs with masses of $0.95 - 1.10\,M_{\odot}$ if SN energy penetrates sufficiently deeply. The resulting born-again stars settle on the C-burning main sequence while they convert their interiors from C and O to Ne and Mg, where they have temperatures and radii similar to some of the observed HVWDs. However, the timescale over which C-burning WDs remain inflated is $\lesssim 10^5\,$yr, which is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the kinematic ages of observed hot HVWDs. We conclude that observed HVWDs are unlikely to be inflated by C burning. The stellar evolution of observed HVWDs remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Empirical Estimate of Solar EUV Evolution from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; 100 -- 911 \AA) spectra of F, G, K, and M stars provide diagnostics of the stellar chromosphere through the corona, with line and continuum formation temperatures spanning roughly 10$^{4}$ - 10$^{7}$ K. The EUV stellar spectrum in turn drives atmospheric photochemistry and numerous escape processes on orbiting planets. We present a new study of the EUV history of solar-type stars, using new and archival {\it Hubble Space Telescope} observations of solar analogs (T$_{\odot}$ $\pm$ 150 K for stars older than 100 Myr) and ``Young Suns" (age $&lt;$ 100 Myr) that will evolve into main sequence early G-type stars to predict the 90 -- 360 \AA\ EUV flux from a sample of 23 stars. We find that the EUV activity evolution for solar-type stars follows a two-component behavior: a saturated L(EUV)/L$_{bol}$ plateau (at a level of about 10$^{-4}$) followed by a power law decay ($\alpha$ $\approx$ $-$1.1) after ages of $\approx$ 50 -- 100 Myr. Consequently, the EUV flux incident at 1 AU around solar analogs varies over the lifetime of the Sun, ranging from 100 $\times$ the present day UV irradiance at 10 Myr to 0.3 $\times$ the present-day level at 10 Gyr. We find that the EUV luminosity is approximately the same as the soft X-ray luminosity up to approximately 1 Gyr, after which the EUV luminosity of the stars dominate. In comparison to Sun-like stars, the EUV saturation level of early/mid M dwarfs is several times higher and lasts $\sim$10 -- 20 times longer.</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution through the Red Supergiant phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars less massive than ~30 Msol evolve into a red supergiant after the main sequence. Given a standard IMF, this means about 80% of all single massive stars will experience this phase. RSGs are dominated by convection, with a radius that may extend up to thousands of solar radii. Their low temperature and gravity make them prone to lose large amounts of masses, either through a pulsationally-driven wind or through mass-loss outburst. RSGs are the progenitors of the most common core-collapse supernovae, the type II. In the present review, we give an overview of our theoretical understanding about this spectacular phase of massive stars evolution.</description>

      <title>The Red and Yellow Hypergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The red and yellow hypergiants are a rare and important phase in the evolution of the most massive stars that can reach the cool part of the HR Diagram. The hypergiant phase is commonly characterized by high, often episodic mass-loss rates and significant changes in spectral type, probably due to the formation of a pseudo photopsphere during a high mass-loss episode. Many of the yellow hypergiants are the immediate successors to the most luminous red supergiants, and often show evidence in their dusty, circumstellar envelopes from past red supergiant activity. In this paper we review the yellow and red hypergiants with an emphasis on how they differ from more normal red supergiants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiants are the largest stars known with some of the highest mass loss rates observed. They are the final stage in the evolution of the majority of massive stars. The unexpected discovery of high mass loss episodes in many red supergiants have posed questions about the role of mass loss on their final stages. The papers in this volume are timely reviews of our current understanding of this often surprising population of massive stars. This introductory paper is a brief summary of their observed properties and a historical perspective on some of the current problems on mass loss, their circumstellar environments, and their evolutionary state.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse, the Prototypical Red Supergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of the bright red supergiant, Betelgeuse, is described with results principally from the past 6 years. The review includes imaging, photometry, and spectroscopy to record the Great Dimming of 2019--2020. This event was followed by a slow ongoing recovery from the massive surface mass ejection after which the stellar characteristics changed. Theoretical simulations address the cause of this episodic mass ejection and the optical Dimming. Recent publications evaluating the perplexing 2100 day periodicity in the star's brightness and radial velocity provide evidence that Betelgeuse may harbor a companion object. Current attempts at direct detection of this companion are discussed. Betelgeuse provides a well-studied and meaningful example for supergiant stars in our Galaxy and others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The envelopes of Red Supergiants (RSGs) have a unique chemical environment not seen in other types of stars. They foster an oxygen-rich synthesis but are tempered by sporadic and chaotic mass loss, which distorts the envelope and creates complex outflow sub-structures consisting of knots, clumps, and arcs. Near the stellar photosphere, molecules and grains form under approximate LTE conditions, as predicted by chemical models. However, the complicated outflows appear to have distinct chemistries generated by shocks and dust destruction. Various RSG envelopes have been probed for their molecular content, mostly by radio and millimeter observations; however, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) and NML Cygni (NML Cyg) display the highest chemical complexity, and also the most complicated envelope structure. Thus far, over 29 different molecules have been identified in the envelopes of RSGs. Some molecules are common for circumstellar gas, including CO, SiO, HCN and H$_2$O, which have abundances of $\sim$$10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}$, relative to H$_2$. More exotic oxides have additionally been discovered, such as AlO, AlOH, PO, TiO$_2$, and VO, with abundances of $\sim$$10^{-9}$--$10^{-7}$. RSG shells support intricate maser emission in OH, H$_2$O and SiO, as well. Studies of isotope ratios in molecules suggest dredge-up at least into the H-burning shell, but further exploration is needed.</description>

      <title>Red Supergiant Mass Loss and Mass-Loss Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review discusses the causes, nature, importance and observational evidence of mass loss by red supergiants. It arrives at the perception that mass loss finds its origin in the gravity which makes the star a star in the first place, and is a mechanism for the star to equilibrate. This is corroborated by a careful examination of various popular historical and recent empirical mass-loss rate prescriptions and theoretical works, and which provides no evidence for an explicit dependence of red supergiant mass loss on metallicity though dust-associated mass loss becomes less prevalent at lower metallicity. It also identifies a common problem in methods that use tracers of mass loss, which do not correct for varying scaling factors (often because there is no information available on which to base such correction) and as a result tend to underestimate mass-loss rates at the lower end. Conversely, dense, extended chromospheres in themselves do not translate into high mass-loss rates, and the significance of stochastic mass loss can be overstated. On a population scale, on the other hand, binary interaction acts as a stochastic agent of mass loss of great import. In all, evidence is overwhelming that points at red supergiants at the lower mass end losing mass at insufficient rates to shed their mantles before core collapse, but massive (at birth) red supergiants to be prone to intense, dusty mass loss which sees them become hotter stars before meeting their fate. This is consistent with the identified progenitors of hydrogen-rich supernovae. Supernova evolution holds great promise to probe the mass loss but we caution against confusing atmospheres with winds. Finally, promising avenues are looked into, which could forge step-change progress in what has been a long and arduous search for the holy grail of red supergiant mass loss. We may yet find it!</description>

      <title>Red Supergiants as Supernova Progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inevitable fate of massive stars in the initial mass range of ~8--30 M_{Sun} in the red supergiant (RSG) phase is a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion, although some stars may collapse directly to a black hole. We know that this is the case, since RSGs have been directly identified and characterized for a number of supernovae (SNe) in pre-explosion archival optical and infrared images. RSGs likely all have some amount of circumstellar matter (CSM), through nominal mass loss, although evidence exists that some RSGs must experience enhanced mass loss during their lifetimes. The SNe from RSGs are hydrogen-rich Type II-Plateau (II-P), and SNe II-P at the low end of the luminosity range tend to arise from low-luminosity RSGs. The typical spectral energy distribution (SED) for such RSGs can generally be fit with a cool photospheric model, whereas the more luminous RSG progenitors of more luminous SNe II-P tend to require a greater quantity of dust in their CSM to account for their SEDs. The SN II-P progenitor luminosity range is log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 4.0--5.2. The fact RSGs are known up to log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 5.7 leads to the so-called ``RSG problem'', which may, in the end, be a result of small number of available statistics to date.</description>

      <title>Interplanetary magnetic correlation and low-frequency spectrum over many solar rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations and structure across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales are frequently studied in the solar wind. The properties of the low-frequency fluctuations are of relevance to turbulent energy injection into the plasma and the transport of high-energy cosmic rays. Correlation analysis of decade-long intervals of interplanetary data permits study of fluctuations at time scales much longer than suitably defined correlation times, and therefore at frequencies well below those associated with the Kolmogorov inertial range of in situ turbulence. At the frequencies of interest, we study the familiar occurrence of the 1/f spectral signature. We also study point spectral features due to solar rotation and their relation with the 1/f signal. We report novel properties at timescales ranging from minutes up to years, using data selected by wind speed, phase of solar cycle, and cartesian components of the magnetic field. A surprising finding is that the power in solar rotation harmonics is consistent with an extension of the 1/f spectrum, down to frequencies as low as around 5e-7 Hz. The presence of a broadband 1/f spectrum across different wind types supports the interpretation that 1/f signals may be related to or even originate from the solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Waiting Time Distribution of Supra-Arcade Downflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are dark, sunward-moving structures above the arcade of flare loops. Naturally they are considered to be associated with outflows resulting from magnetic reconnection at the vertical current sheet beneath the eruptive structure. Despite the extensive investigations on the SAD properties, the timing information, particularly the waiting time between consecutive SADs, has not been systematically examined. Here, using the 131~{\AA} passband of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we studied the waiting time distribution (WTD) of SADs in 7 eruptive flares. In six of the 7 flares, the SADs are identified and tracked in previous studies, by two different methods; and in the 7th flare, by our optimized manual method. Based on statistical evaluations, we found that most of the WTDs are best fitted by a power-law function with the slope ranging from 1.7 to 2.4, in accordance with the prediction of non-stationary Poisson processes or self-organized criticality; but often they can also be fitted almost equally well by a log-normal function. These results rule out linear random or quasi-periodic processes to be responsible for the generation of SADs, but suggest that several nonlinear mechanisms be coupled together in the reconnection outflow region to shape the heavy-tailed WTD of SADs.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Rovibrational CO in the Era of JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of CO rovibrational emission lines in the 183 infrared spectra of nearby Class II objects obtained with the NIRSPEC instrument on the Keck II telescope over the past two decades. The sample includes a broad range of stellar mass (both T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be) and disk evolutionary states (from full to debris disks). We find that 53% of the sample has CO rovibrational emission lines present in their spectrum with disk/stellar subtype detection rates of 82% for transition disks, 61% for Herbigs, and 77% for CTTSs. Although there is no discernible difference between T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be star CO detection rates, the detection of accretion and of CO are statistically correlated in T Tauri stars but not in Herbig Ae/Be objects. Within the sample of T Tauri stars, we find that no weak-line T Tauri stars have CO rovibrational emission lines. We use slab modeling to analyze the density, temperature, and emitting area of the sample. The retrieval results imply that Herbig Ae/Be objects tend to have cooler and larger CO emitting regions than T Tauri stars. We find that the CO emitting area is not a thin ring as defined by temperature, but a ring of varying size likely dependent on the structure of the disk. We also present guidelines on how to approach CO rovibrational emission lines in JWST spectra and present methods for linking ground-based observations with JWST spectra. This includes line-to-continuum ratio estimates based on stellar mass and accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Observations of microwave emission from solar jets and comparison with MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computed the thermal microwave emission from a 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation and compared it with observations of solar jets. The simulation treats the emergence of magnetic flux into the solar atmosphere and its interaction with a low, pre-existing ambient magnetic field. This interaction leads to the formation and development of a jet, driven by an eruption. The computed 17 GHz radio emission is compared with a number of observed jets, with respect to their morphology, their flux, and the rise time of the radio flux. We find that the MHD model reproduces the characteristics of lower-intensity jets reasonably well, whereas there are differences with stronger jets. We suggest possible ways to obtain more realistic jets from MHD simulations, so that they match better the real jets.</description>

      <title>Understanding the magnetic field and plasma-$\beta$ along umbral fan loops traced using 3-min slow waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasma-$\beta$ is an important fundamental physical quantity in solar plasma physics, which determines the dominating process in the solar atmosphere, i.e., magnetic or thermodynamic processes. Here, for the first time, we provide variations of magnetic field and plasma-$\beta$ along magnetically structured loops from the photosphere to the corona. We have selected several fan loops rooted in sunspot umbra observed simultaneously by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and Solar Dynamics Observatory. The 3-min slow waves enabled us to trace and analyze several fan loops with cross-sectional areas in the lower atmosphere and locate their footpoints at the photosphere. We find the RMS magnetic field strengths in the range 1596-2269 G at the photospheric footpoints of the fan loops, which decrease rapidly to 158-236 G at the coronal footpoints. We estimated the plasma-$\beta$ at the photospheric and coronal footpoints in the range 0.2-0.5 and 0.0001-0.001, respectively. We found plasma-$\beta$$&lt;$$1$ along the whole loop, whereas the plasma-$\beta$$\approx$$1$ layer is found to be at sub-photospheric heights. We compared our findings for isolated individual fan loops with a previously established model for active regions and found an almost similar pattern in variations with height, but with different plasma-$\beta$ values. Our results demonstrate the seismological potential of 3-min slow waves omnipresent in the umbral sunspot atmosphere to probe and map isolated loops and determine magnetic field and plasma-$\beta$ along these loops. The obtained parameters provide crucial ingredients for the theoretical modeling of the umbral atmosphere and wave dynamics along loops.</description>

      <title>Challan: Solar Full-disk Imaging-Spectroscopic Telescope using the Drift-Scanning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Challan instrument is a solar full-disk imaging spectroscopic telescope planned to be installed at three sites with a 120-degree longitudinal difference, enabling continuous 24-hour observations of the Sun. It will take data every 2.5 min with a spatial resolution of $2-3^{\prime\prime}$ and a spectral resolving power (R) of &gt;43,000 in H$\alpha$ and Ca II 854.2 nm bands simultaneously. Challan is composed of two modules, each dedicated to a specific waveband. This modular design is beneficial in minimizing the scattered light and simplifying the structure and engineering. The primary scientific goal of Challan is to investigate solar flares and filament eruptions. It is also expected to detect small-scale events in the solar chromosphere. In 2025, Challan will be installed at the Big Bear Solar Observatory for test observational runs, followed by scientific runs in 2026.</description>

      <title>ANTIHEROES-PRODIGE: Quantifying the connection from envelope to disk with the IRAM 30m telescope and NOEMA I. Attack of the streamers: L1448N's fight for order in the chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation is a hierarchical process ranging from molecular clouds down to individual protostars. In particular how infalling asymmetric structures, called streamers, delivering new material onto protostellar systems, are connected to the surrounding envelope is not understood. We investigate the connection between the cloud material at 10000 au scales down to 300 au scales towards L1448N in the Perseus star-forming region hosting three young Class 0/I protostellar systems. Sensitive molecular line observations taken with the IRAM 30m telescope and NOEMA at 1.4 mm are used to study the kinematic properties in the region traced by the molecular lines. Several infalling streamers are associated with the protostellar systems, some of them traced by C18O and DCN, while one of them is bright in SO and SO2. The kinematic properties of the former streamers are consistent with the velocities observed at large envelope scales of 10000 au, while the latter case show different kinematics. The masses and infall rates of the streamers are 0.01 Msun and 0.01-0.1 Msun and 10^-6 Msun/yr and 5-18x10^-6 Msun/yr for IRS3A and IRS3C, respectively. The envelope mass in the L1448N region is ~16Msun, thus the mass of a single streamer is low compared to the envelope mass (&lt;1%). However, compared to the estimated mass of the protostellar systems a single streamer could deliver up to 1% and 8-17% of mass towards IRS3A (M*~1.2 Msun) and IRS3C (M*~1 Msun), respectively. The rotational signatures of structures in L1448N are all connected - from the large-scale envelope, infalling streamers, down to the rotation of all three disks. Two of the three Class 0/I protostellar systems are still fed by this surrounding material, which can be associated to the remnant envelope. However, we also find a streamer that is bright in SO and SO2 towards IRS3C that could be connected to a nearby sulfur reservoir.</description>

      <title>Modelling gyrosynchrotron emission from coronal energetic electrons in a CME flux rope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can accelerate electrons, causing bursts such as type IV emissions in the solar radio continuum. Although radio spectroscopy is a powerful diagnostic tool for the corona, the origin and mechanisms of type IV bursts remain uncertain. In situ measurements can occasionally shed some light on these mechanisms, but they are limited in space and time. Sophisticated numerical modelling offers the best approach to improve our understanding of the physical processes involved. This research examines type IV radio bursts, exploring the effects of various electron distribution properties and CMEs on their generation and characteristics. To transcend idealised assumptions, we employ realistic, anisotropic electron distributions - obtained from particle transport simulations within complex magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) environments - as input for radio emission models. We use the 3D MHD model COCONUT to generate coronal background configurations, including a CME modelled as a modified Titov-D\'{e}moulin magnetic flux rope (MFR). These MHD simulations are used by the PARADISE particle transport code, which injects energetic electrons into the MFR and tracks their evolution. Finally, we feed the electron distributions and solar wind parameters into the Ultimate Fast Gyrosynchrotron (GS) Codes to compute radio emission along lines of sight. Electrons injected close to the MFR's central axis remain largely confined, producing a GS emission spectrum resembling observed type IV characteristics. Varying observer positions, CME properties, and spectral indices of the electron energy distributions modify the intensities and durations of the observed bursts. The strongest GS emission is observed to originate from the CME flanks. Our results indicate that GS emission is the major component in type IV spectra, although additional contributors cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>The effect of stellar magnetic activity on measurements of morning and evening asymmetry of planetary terminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differences in the ingress and egress shapes of transit light curves can indicate morning-evening temperature contrasts on transiting planets. Here, we pinpoint an alternative mechanism that can introduce asymmetries in transit light curves, potentially affecting the accurate determination of morning-evening differences. Small-scale magnetic field concentrations on the surfaces of the host star affect the visibility of stellar limb regions, making them brighter relative to the non-magnetic case. A difference in magnetization between the star's western and eastern limbs can thus create an asymmetry in limb brightness and, consequently, an asymmetry between transit ingress and egress. We model the limb darkening and stellar limb asymmetry in solar-like stars using the 3D radiative MHD code MURaM to simulate magnetized stellar atmospheres and the MPS-ATLAS code to synthesize spectra using ray-by-ray approach. Our results show that ingress-egress depth differences can reach up to 600 ppm for a 10000 ppm transit at 600 nm, depending on the magnetization of the stellar limbs--significantly interfering with planetary signals. Observations of the Sun show that such concentrations are often not accompanied by spots and do not manifest in photometric variability, indicating that even photometrically quiet stars can produce such asymmetries. However, planetary and stellar asymmetries exhibit distinct wavelength dependencies, which we propose to leverage for disentangling them.</description>

      <title>Fast magneto-acoustic waves in the solar chromosphere: Comparison of single-fluid and two-fluid approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The mechanism behind the heating of the solar chromosphere remains unclear. Friction between neutrals and charges is expected to contribute to plasma heating in a partially ionised plasma (PIP). Aims: We aim to study the efficiency of the frictional heating mechanism in partially ionised plasmas by comparing a single-fluid model (1F) using ambipolar diffusion and a two-fluid model (2F) that incorporates elastic collision terms. Methods: We use the code MANCHA-2F to solve the equations for both models numerically. The simulations involve the vertical propagation of fast magneto-acoustic waves from the top of the photosphere through the chromosphere. The model atmosphere is vertically stratified, including a horizontal, homogeneous magnetic field. We also apply the linear theory to supplement the numerical results. Finally, we look at the assumptions of the 1F model to find out what causes the model discrepancies. Results: The results show that the temperature increase for the 1F model is slightly higher than for the 2F model, especially with long-period waves. The wave energy flux indicates that in the 2F model, the wave is transporting less energy upwards. From the linear theory, we find that the wave in the 2F model loses more energy than in the 1F model in the deep layers, but the opposite occurs in the high layers. Conclusions: The efficient dissipation in the 2F model in deep layers reduces the energy flux at the high layers, reducing heating and explaining the temperature differences between models. We attribute those discrepancies to the contribution of pressure forces to the drift velocity and the omission of a term related to the centre of mass frame reference in the 1F energy equation.}</description>

      <title>Discovery of SiC and Iron Dust Around AGB Stars in the very Metal-Poor Sextans A Dwarf Galaxy with JWST: Implications for Dust Production at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resolution infrared spectroscopy from JWST confirms the presence of SiC and likely metallic iron dust around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Sextans A dwarf galaxy, which has a metallicity ~1%-7% Z_sun. While metal-poor carbon-rich AGB stars are known to produce copious amounts of amorphous carbon dust owing to the dredge up of newly synthesized carbon, this is the first time that Si- and Fe-bearing dust has been detected at this extreme metallicity. Of the six AGB stars observed, one is an intermediate-mass (~1.2-4 M_sun) carbon star showing SiC dust, and another is an oxygen-rich M-type star with mass ~4-5 M_sun that is likely undergoing hot bottom burning. The infrared excess of the M-type star is strong, but featureless. We tested multiple dust species, and find that it is best fit with metallic iron dust. Assuming its dust-production rate stays constant over the final 2-3x10^4 yr of its evolution, this star will produce ~0.9-3.7 times the iron dust mass predicted by models, with the range depending on the adopted stellar mass. The implications for dust production in high-redshift galaxies are potentially significant, especially regarding the assumed dust species used in dust evolution models and the timescale of AGB dust formation. Stars on the upper end of the AGB mass range can begin producing dust as early as 30-50 Myr after they form, and they may therefore rival dust production by supernovae at high redshift.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present centimeter continuum observations of seven high luminosity massive protostars and their surroundings as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. With data from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyze the spectral index, morphology and multiplicity of the detected radio sources. The high sensitivity and high resolution observations allow us to resolve many sources. We report thirteen new detections and two previously known detections that we observed for the first time in radio frequencies. We use the observations to build radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to calculate spectral indices. With radio morphologies and the spectral indices, we give assessments on the nature of the sources, highlighting five sources that display a radio jet-like morphology and a spectral index consistent with ionized jets. Combining with the SOMA Radio I sample, we present the radio - bolometric luminosity relation, especially probing the regime from $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^4$ to $10^6\:L_\odot$. Here we find a steep rise in radio luminosity, which is expected by models that transition from shock ionization to photoionization.</description>

      <title>The VISCACHA Survey: XIII. The extended main-sequence turn-off in intermediate-age low-mass clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) is a well-known feature observed in young and intermediate-age star clusters, characterized by a significant broadening of the main-sequence turn-off region. Although prolonged star formation and stellar rotation have been proposed as possible explanations, no consensus has yet been reached. Most previous studies have focused on high-mass clusters. In this work, we extend the analysis to the less-explored low-mass regime by investigating star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using data from the VISCACHA survey. We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO width in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a cluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon is also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width relations. In particular, the less massive cluster in our sample does not show an eMSTO, supporting the proposed link between the eMSTO and the escape velocity of the cluster, providing a new lower limit to the age spread of $88\pm40$ Myr for the presence of the eMSTO. The consistent MSTO width measurements between the VISCACHA and HST photometries confirm the robustness of our method and demonstrate that the age spread determination is independent of the photometric system, showing also the power of ground-based observations to investigate the eMSTO phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Converging on the Cepheid Metallicity Dependence: Implications of Non-Standard Gaia Parallax Recalibration on Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore &amp; Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. Further, by shortening the Milky Way distance scale, the MF25 calibration raises the local Hubble constant by $\sim$1 km/s/Mpc, increasing the Hubble tension significantly. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.</description>

      <title>Red Supergiants in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifications of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies have experienced an exponential increase in recent years, driven by advancements in selection techniques, the continued expansion of archival datasets, and a steady increase in spectroscopic data. This review describes the advances in methodologies and selection criteria for identifying RSGs and presents the current census of these stars in our own Galaxy and nearby galaxies. It also describes the insights gained from resolving nearby RSGs and their complex circumstellar material in the Milky Way and from the growing samples of RSGs being discovered in the Local Group and beyond. These advances impact the Humphreys--Davidson limit in the cool part of the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. Furthermore, they provide insight into extreme RSGs and the role of photometric variability and, in particular, of the newly discovered phenomenon of dimming events. Recent observations have enabled the determination of the binarity fraction among RSGs, offering new constraints to stellar evolution. Looking ahead, the synergy between large-scale surveys, high-resolution observations, and emerging machine-learning tools promises to further transform our understanding of the final evolutionary stages of massive stars in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f&gt;0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The mass of TOI-654 b: A short-period sub-Neptune transiting a mid-M dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes are small planets between the size of the Earth and Neptune. The orbital and bulk properties of transiting sub-Neptunes can provide clues for their formation and evolution of small planets. In this paper, we report on follow-up observations of a planetary system around the mid-M dwarf TOI-654, whose transiting sub-Neptune TOI-654 b ($P=1.53$ day) is validated as a suitable target for the atmospheric observation. We measure the planetary mass and stellar properties with the InfraRed Doppler instrument (IRD) mounted on the Subaru telescope and obtain the stellar and planetary properties from additional transit observations by the Transit Exoplanetary Survey Satellite (TESS) and a series of the Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting exoplanets (MuSCAT). As a result, the planetary mass of TOI-654 b is determined to be $M_{{\rm p}} = 8.71 \pm 1.25 M_{\oplus}$, and the radius is updated to be $R_{\rm p} = 2.378 \pm 0.089 R_{\oplus}$. The bulk density suggests that the planet is composed of a rocky and volatile-rich core or a rocky core surrounded by a small amount of H/He envelope.TOI-654 b is one of unique planets located around the radius valley and and also on the outer edge of the Neptune desert. The precise mass determination enables us to constrain the atmospheric properties with future spectroscopic observations especially for the emission by the James Webb Space Telescope and Ariel.</description>

      <title>Silicate mineralogy and bulk composition of exoplanetary material in polluted white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf planetary systems uniquely link the bulk elemental composition of exoplanetary material to the mineralogy as photospheric abundances can be compared to circumstellar dust mineralogy. This study re-examines Spitzer/IRS spectra of eight white dwarfs with both circumstellar dust and photospheric metals. All systems show 10$\mu$m silicate emission features consistent with a mixture of olivine and pyroxene silicates, with varying dominance. New Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of two of these systems, GD56 and WD1150-153, reveal that both are accreting dry, rocky material. WD1150-153 is accreting material consistent with Bulk Earth, while GD56 is accreting core-rich material with an inferred core mass fraction of 0.59$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (0.37$^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ by mole). A comparison between the bulk elemental composition of the accreted planetary material and the dust mineralogy of the eight systems reveals a tentative correlation between the dominant silicate mineralogy and the Mg/Si ratio, indicating that the circumstellar and photospheric material are compositionally similar. This suggests that rapid and well-mixed accretion is occurring with minimal compositional alteration. Furthermore, new GGCHEM equilibrium chemistry models confirm that Mg-rich planetary material preferentially forms olivine-rich dust, highlighting the importance of equilibrium in planetary chemistry and that a host star or rock's Mg/Si can be used to predict whether its silicate mineralogy is olivine- or pyroxene-dominated, influencing its capacity to structurally store water, recycle key nutrients, and possibly habitability.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Neural Networks: Emulating Late Burning Stages in Core Collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in modeling massive stars to the onset of core collapse is the computational bottleneck of nucleosynthesis during advanced burning stages. The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of fully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the simulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability. To overcome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with multiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate its performance. The NNN takes the temperature, density and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting isotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates. We generate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core depletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the predictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net. We find that the NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by $280-660\:\%$, the average atomic and mass numbers by $150-360 \%$ and the nuclear energy generation by $250-750\:\%$, consistently outperforming the small network across all timesteps. They also achieve significantly better predictions of neutrino losses on relatively short timescales, with improvements ranging from $100-10^{6}\:\%$. While further work is needed to enhance their accuracy and applicability to different stellar conditions, integrating NNN trained models into stellar evolution codes is promising for facilitating large-scale generation of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors with higher physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>The Kick Velocity Distribution of Isolated Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than 10 Myr follow a log-normal distribution with $\mu=5.60\pm0.12$ and $\sigma=0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}$150--200 km/s, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below 40 Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with $\mu=5.67\pm0.10$ and $\sigma=0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Stars Match the Spectral Signatures of JWST's Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M_\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the V-shaped Balmer break morphology is shown to be an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant candidate G118.4+37.0 associated with the Calvera pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT ~ 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and O abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kyr old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinct "Clump" region shows hard emission equally well described by a thermal (kT ~ 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma ~ 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Halpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded.</description>
