      <title>In-depth Research Impact Summarization through Fine-Grained Temporal Citation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of scientific publications is crucial for identifying breakthroughs and guiding future research. Traditional metrics based on citation counts often miss the nuanced ways a paper contributes to its field. In this work, we propose a new task: generating nuanced, expressive, and time-aware impact summaries that capture both praise (confirmation citations) and critique (correction citations) through the evolution of fine-grained citation intents. We introduce an evaluation framework tailored to this task, showing moderate to strong human correlation on subjective metrics such as insightfulness. Expert feedback from professors reveals a strong interest in these summaries and suggests future improvements.</description>

      <title>GitHub Repository Complexity Leads to Diminished Web Archive Availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software is often developed using versioned controlled software, such as Git, and hosted on centralized Web hosts, such as GitHub and GitLab. These Web hosted software repositories are made available to users in the form of traditional HTML Web pages for each source file and directory, as well as a presentational home page and various descriptive pages. We examined more than 12,000 Web hosted Git repository project home pages, primarily from GitHub, to measure how well their presentational components are preserved in the Internet Archive, as well as the source trees of the collected GitHub repositories to assess the extent to which their source code has been preserved. We found that more than 31% of the archived repository home pages examined exhibited some form of minor page damage and 1.6% exhibited major page damage. We also found that of the source trees analyzed, less than 5% of their source files were archived, on average, with the majority of repositories not having source files saved in the Internet Archive at all. The highest concentration of archived source files available were those linked directly from repositories' home pages at a rate of 14.89% across all available repositories and sharply dropping off at deeper levels of a repository's directory tree.</description>

      <title>A two-stage model for factors influencing citation counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to study a count response random variable, the number of citations of a research paper, affected by some explanatory variables through a suitable regression model. Due to the fact that the count variable exhibits substantial variation since the sample variance is larger than the sample mean, the classical Poisson regression model seems not to be appropriate. We concentrate attention on the negative binomial regression model, which allows the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. Nevertheless, the process of citations of papers may be divided into two parts. In the first stage, the paper has no citations, and the second part provides the intensity of the citations. A hurdle model for separating the documents with citations and those without citations is considered. The dataset for the empirical application consisted of 43,190 research papers in the field of Economics and Business from 2014-2021, obtained from The Lens database. Citation counts and social attention scores for each article were gathered from Altmetric database. The main findings indicate that both collaboration and funding have a positive impact on citation counts and reduce the likelihood of receiving zero citations. Higher journal impact factors lead to higher citation counts, while lower peer review ratings lead to fewer citations and a higher probability of zero citations. Mentions in news, blogs, and social media have varying but generally limited effects on citation counts. Open access via repositories (green OA) correlates with higher citation counts and a lower probability of zero citations. In contrast, OA via the publisher's website without an explicit open license (bronze OA) is associated with higher citation counts but also with a higher probability of zero citations.</description>
