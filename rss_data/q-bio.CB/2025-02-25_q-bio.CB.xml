      <title>Multidimensional Classification Framework for Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15868</link>

Abstract: Breast cancer cell lines are indispensable tools for unraveling disease mechanisms, developing new drugs and personalized medicine, yet their heterogeneity and inconsistent classification pose significant challenges in model selection and data reproducibility. This article aims at providing a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for broadly mapping the essential features of publicly available human breast cancer cell lines. The cells are classified using (1) absolute criteria, i.e. objective features such as origin (e.g., MDA-MB, MCF), histological subtype (ductal, lobular), hormone receptor status (ER/PR/HER2), and genetic mutations (BRCA1, TP53), and (2) relative criteria, which contextualize functional behaviors like metastatic potential, drug sensitivity and genomic instability. We systematically catalog over 70 cell lines, detailing their molecular profiles, research applications and clinical relevance. Critical gaps are addressed, including the underrepresentation of cell lines from young patients, male breast cancer, and diverse ethnicities, as well as genetic drift during long-term culture. This article bridges in vitro studies with meaningful applications, offering a tool for easily selecting lines that mirror specific research objectives in a clinical setting. The goal is to empower researchers to optimize experimental design, enhance translational relevance and accelerate therapeutic development to advance precision oncology in breast cancer research.</description>

      <title>Complexity reduction by symmetry: uncovering the minimal regulatory network for logical computation in bacteria</title>

Abstract: Symmetry principles play an important role in geometry, and physics, allowing for the reduction of complicated systems to simpler, more comprehensible models that preserve the system's features of interest. Biological systems are often highly complex and may consist of a large number of interacting parts. Using symmetry fibrations, the relevant symmetries for biological "message-passing" networks, we introduce a scheme, called Complexity Reduction by Symmetry or ComSym, to reduce the gene regulatory networks of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria to core networks in a way that preserves the dynamics and uncovers the computational capabilities of the network. Gene nodes in the original network that share isomorphic input trees are collapsed by the fibration into equivalence classes called fibers, whereby nodes that receive signals with the same "history" belong to one fiber and synchronize. Then we reduce the networks to its minimal computational core via k-core decomposition. This computational core consists of a few strongly connected components or "signal vortices", in which signals can cycle through. While between them, these "signal vortices" transmit signals in a feedforward manner. These connected components perform signal processing and decision making in the bacterial cell by employing a series of genetic toggle-switch circuits that store memory, plus oscillator circuits. These circuits act as the central computation device of the network, whose output signals then spread to the rest of the network. Our reduction method opens the door to narrow the vast complexity of biological systems to their minimal parts in a systematic way by using fundamental theoretical principles of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Mutation Theory of SARS-CoV-2 Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. Developing an evolutionary model capable of continuously integrating new experimental data is an urgent priority. By employing well-founded assumptions for mutant representation (four-letter and two-letter formats) and the n-mer distance algorithm, we constructed an evolutionary tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that accurately reflects observed viral strain evolution. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X of x randomly generated sites on the spike protein. Our analysis reveals that the position of a generated strain on the tree is determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the proportions of macro-lineages shift: lineage O surpasses lineage N, lineage P overtakes O, and ultimately, new lineage Q surpasses P. We identified threshold values of x that distinguish between macro-lineages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear regression of the number of mutated sites (x) against sample collection dates (t) provides a robust approximation, enabling the prediction of new lineage emergence based on the x-t relationship. To conclude, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains on the evolutionary tree can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites; and the large-scale stochastic sampling uncovers evolutionary patterns governing the emergence of diverse macro-lineages.</description>
