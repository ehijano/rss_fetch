      <title>Entropy-Guided Multiplicative Updates: KL Projections for Multi-Factor Target Exposures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop \emph{Entropy-Guided Multiplicative Updates} (EGMU), a convex optimization framework for constructing multi-factor target-exposure portfolios by minimizing Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence from a benchmark subject to linear factor constraints. Our contributions are theoretical and algorithmic. (\emph{i}) We formalize feasibility and uniqueness: with strictly positive benchmark and feasible targets in the convex hull of exposures, the solution is unique and strictly positive. (\emph{ii}) We derive the dual concave program with gradient $t-\E_{w(\theta)}[x]$ and Hessian $-\Cov_{w(\theta)}(x)$, and give a precise sensitivity formula $\partial\theta^*/\partial t=\Cov_{w^*}(x)^{-1}$ and $\partial w^*/\partial t=\mathrm{diag}(w^*) (X-\1\mu^\top)\Cov_{w^*}(x)^{-1}$. (\emph{iii}) We present two provably convergent solvers: a damped \emph{dual Newton} method with global convergence and local quadratic rate, and a \emph{KL-projection} scheme based on IPF/Bregman--Dykstra for equalities and inequalities. (\emph{iv}) We further \textbf{generalize EGMU} with \emph{elastic targets} (strongly concave dual) and \emph{robust target sets} (support-function dual), and introduce a \emph{path-following ODE} for solution trajectories, all reusing the same dual-moment structure and solved via Newton or proximal-gradient schemes. (\emph{v}) We detail numerically stable and scalable implementations (LogSumExp, covariance regularization, half-space KL-projections). We emphasize theory and reproducible algorithms; empirical benchmarking is optional.</description>

      <title>Representation of forward performance criteria with random endowment via FBSDE and its application to forward optimized certainty equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of forward performance criteria to settings with random endowment in incomplete markets. Building on these results, we introduce and develop the novel concept of \textit{forward optimized certainty equivalent (forward OCE)}, which offers a genuinely dynamic valuation mechanism that accommodates progressively adaptive market model updates, stochastic risk preferences, and incoming claims with arbitrary maturities.
  In parallel, we develop a new methodology to analyze the emerging stochastic optimization problems by directly studying the candidate optimal control processes for both the primal and dual problems. Specifically, we derive two new systems of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, and various equivalences between the two problems. This new approach is general and complements the existing one for forward performance criteria with random endowment based on backward stochastic partial differential equations (backward SPDEs) for the related value functions. We, also, consider representative examples for both forward performance criteria with random endowment and for forward OCE. Furthermore, for the case of exponential criteria, we investigate the connection between forward OCE and forward entropic risk measures.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Structure of Trend Premia: When Diversification Hides Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has emphasized the diversification benefits of combining trend signals across multiple horizons, with the medium-term window-typically six months to one year-long viewed as the "sweet spot" of trend-following. This paper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically across horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the optimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common practice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally from all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and empirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the asset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying Bayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate dynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band contributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and long-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe ratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then rationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that the medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The resulting "barbell" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures most of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges the common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and suggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary redundancy in trend premia.</description>
