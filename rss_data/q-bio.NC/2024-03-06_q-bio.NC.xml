      <title>Simplicity in Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of visual stimuli plays an important role in many cognitive phenomena, including attention, engagement, memorability, time perception and aesthetic evaluation. Despite its importance, complexity is poorly understood and ironically, previous models of image complexity have been quite \textit{complex}. There have been many attempts to find handcrafted features that explain complexity, but these features are usually dataset specific, and hence fail to generalise. On the other hand, more recent work has employed deep neural networks to predict complexity, but these models remain difficult to interpret, and do not guide a theoretical understanding of the problem. Here we propose to model complexity using segment-based representations of images. We use state-of-the-art segmentation models, SAM and FC-CLIP, to quantify the number of segments at multiple granularities, and the number of classes in an image respectively. We find that complexity is well-explained by a simple linear model with these two features across six diverse image-sets of naturalistic scene and art images. This suggests that the complexity of images can be surprisingly simple.</description>

      <title>Synaptic Weight Distributions Depend on the Geometry of Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing literature in computational neuroscience leverages gradient descent and learning algorithms that approximate it to study synaptic plasticity in the brain. However, the vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice of distance for synaptic changes - i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity. Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with non-Euclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning. Overall, our work shows that the current paradigm in theoretical work on synaptic plasticity that assumes Euclidean synaptic geometry may be misguided and that it should be possible to experimentally determine the true geometry of synaptic plasticity in the brain.</description>

      <title>An internal sensory model allows for balance control based on non-actionable proprioceptive feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All motor tasks with a mechanical system (a human body, a rider on a bicycle) that is approximately linear in the part of the state space where it stays most of the time (e.g., upright balance control) have the following property: actionable sensory feedback allows for optimal control actions that are a simple linear combination of the sensory feedback. When only non-actionable sensory feedback is available, optimal control for these approximately linear mechanical systems is based on an internal dynamical system that estimates the states, and that can be implemented as a recurrent neural network (RNN). It uses a sensory model to update the state estimates with the non-actionable sensory feedback, and the weights of this RNN are fully specified by results from optimal feedback control. This is highly relevant for muscle spindle afferent firing rates which, under perfectly coordinated fusimotor and skeletomotor control, scale with the exafferent joint acceleration component. The resulting control mechanism balances a standing body and a rider-bicycle combination using realistic parameter values and with forcing torques that are feasible for humans.</description>

      <title>On the use of associative memory in Hopfield networks designed to solve propositional satisfiability problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopfield networks are an attractive choice for solving many types of computational problems because they provide a biologically plausible mechanism. The Self-Optimization (SO) model adds to the Hopfield network by using a biologically founded Hebbian learning rule, in combination with repeated network resets to arbitrary initial states, for optimizing its own behavior towards some desirable goal state encoded in the network. In order to better understand that process, we demonstrate first that the SO model can solve concrete combinatorial problems in SAT form, using two examples of the Liars problem and the map coloring problem. In addition, we show how under some conditions critical information might get lost forever with the learned network producing seemingly optimal solutions that are in fact inappropriate for the problem it was tasked to solve. What appears to be an undesirable side-effect of the SO model, can provide insight into its process for solving intractable problems.</description>
