      <title>CAP: Commutative Algebra Prediction of Protein-Nucleic Acid Binding Affinities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinity is vital for deciphering genomic processes, yet existing approaches often struggle in reconciling high accuracy with interpretability and computational efficiency. In this study, we introduce commutative algebra prediction (CAP), which couples persistent Stanley-Reisner theory with advanced sequence embedding for predicting protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. CAP encodes proteins through transformer-learned embeddings that retain long-range evolutionary context and represents DNA and RNA with $\textit{k}$-mer algebra embeddings derived from persistent facet ideals, which capture fine-scale nucleotide geometry. We demonstrate that CAP surpasses the SVSBI protein-nucleic acid benchmark and, in a further test, maintains reasonable performance on newly curated protein-RNA and protein-nucleic acid datasets. Leveraging only primary sequences, CAP generalizes to any protein-nucleic acid pair with minimal preprocessing, enabling genome-scale analyses without 3D structural data and promising faster virtual screening for drug discovery and protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Graph Identification of Proteins in Tomograms (GRIP-Tomo) 2.0: Topologically Aware Classification for Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables structural characterization of biomolecules under near-native conditions. Existing approaches for interpreting the resulting three-dimensional volumes are computationally expensive and have difficulty interpreting density associated with small proteins/complexes. To explore alternate approaches for identifying proteins in cryo-ET data we pursued a Graph Network and topologically invariant approach. Here, we report on a fast algorithm that distinguishes volumes containing protein density from noise by searching for nuances of evolutionarily conversed motifs and the geometrical characteristics of protein structure. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 is a machine-learning pipeline that extracts interpretable topological features of protein structures within noisy experimental backgrounds. Compared to version 1.0, the new pipeline includes three upgrades that significantly improve performance including synthetic tomogram generation simulating realistic noise, graph-based persistent feature extraction as protein fingerprints, and high-performance computing acceleration. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 achieves over 90% accuracy in distinguishing proteins from noise for synthetic datasets and over 80% accuracy for real datasets, which represents a foundational step toward advancing cryo-ET workflows and empowering automated detection of both small and large proteins for visual proteomics.</description>

      <title>Heart Rate Variability Patterns Reflect Yoga Intervention in Chronically Stressed Pregnant Women: A Quasi-Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prenatal maternal stress (PS) is a risk factor for adverse offspring neurodevelopment. Heart rate variability (HRV) complexity provides a non-invasive marker of maternal autonomic regulation and may be influenced by mind--body interventions such as Yoga. In this quasi-randomized controlled trial, 28 chronically stressed pregnant women were followed from the second trimester until birth: 14 participated in weekly Hatha Yoga with electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, and 14 received standard obstetric care with monthly ECGs. Group allocation was based on availability, with participants unaware of their assignment at enrollment. HRV complexity was assessed first with Sample Entropy and Entropy Rate and then expanded to 94 HRV metrics spanning temporal, frequency, nonlinear, and information-theoretical domains. All metrics were covariate-adjusted (maternal age, BMI, gestational age), standardized, and analyzed using timepoint-specific principal component analysis (PCA). From this, a unified HRV index was derived. Analyses revealed that HRV metric relationships changed dynamically across pregnancy, with PCA loadings shifting from frequency toward complexity measures in late gestation. The mixed effects model identified a significant time x group interaction effect (p = 0.041). These findings suggest a restructuring of HRV signal-analytical domains with advancing pregnancy attributable to Yoga and highlight the utility of advanced HRV analysis frameworks for future, larger trials.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Graph Ensemble Embeddings for Aptamer Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity, producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Linearized Optimal Transport for Analysis of High-Dimensional Point-Cloud and Single-Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells, enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes, offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT) framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure. This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions; and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids, exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.</description>

      <title>Synthetic-to-Real Transfer Learning for Chromatin-Sensitive PWS Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromatin sensitive partial wave spectroscopic (csPWS) microscopy enables label free detection of nanoscale chromatin packing alterations that occur before visible cellular transformation. However, manual nuclear segmentation limits population scale analysis needed for biomarker discovery in early cancer detection. The lack of annotated csPWS imaging data prevents direct use of standard deep learning methods. We present CFU Net, a hierarchical segmentation architecture trained with a three stage curriculum on synthetic multimodal data. CFU Net achieves near perfect performance on held out synthetic test data that represent diverse spectroscopic imaging conditions without manual annotations (Dice 0.9879, IoU 0.9895). Our approach uses physics based rendering that incorporates empirically supported chromatin packing statistics, Mie scattering models, and modality specific noise, combined with a curriculum that progresses from adversarial RGB pretraining to spectroscopic fine tuning and histology validation. CFU Net integrates five architectural elements (ConvNeXt backbone, Feature Pyramid Network, UNet plus plus dense connections, dual attention, and deep supervision) that together improve Dice over a baseline UNet by 8.3 percent. We demonstrate deployment ready INT8 quantization with 74.9 percent compression and 0.15 second inference, giving a 240 times throughput gain over manual analysis. Applied to more than ten thousand automatically segmented nuclei from synthetic test data, the pipeline extracts chromatin biomarkers that distinguish normal from pre cancerous tissue with large effect sizes (Cohens d between 1.31 and 2.98), reaching 94 percent classification accuracy. This work provides a general framework for synthetic to real transfer learning in specialized microscopy and open resources for community validation on clinical specimens.</description>

      <title>Predicting Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease using Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease. Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.</description>

      <title>Tuned for Creativity? Graph-Theoretical Mapping of Resting-State EEG Reveals Neural Signatures of Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how creativity is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While resting-state fMRI studies have revealed large-scale network correlates of creative potential, electroencephalography (EEG) offers a temporally precise and scalable approach to capture the fast oscillatory dynamics that underlie spontaneous neural organization. In this study, we used a data-driven network approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults. Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged, differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1, characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity, relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity. Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns can index stable cognitive traits such as creativity. More broadly, they point to an intrinsic neural signature of adaptive brain function marked by efficient yet flexible network organization that may support creative and adaptive cognition.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for Multi-Modal Protein Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts (e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding (DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms. First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method, where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically, DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains 0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing protein function prediction.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cell Dynamics and Interactions with Unbalanced Mean Field Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the dynamics from sparsely time-resolved snapshot data is crucial for understanding complex cellular processes and behavior. Existing methods leverage optimal transport, Schr\"odinger bridge theory, or their variants to simultaneously infer stochastic, unbalanced dynamics from snapshot data. However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to account for cell-cell interactions. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios since intercellular communications are fundamental life processes and can influence cell state-transition dynamics. To address this challenge, we formulate the Unbalanced Mean-Field Schr\"odinger Bridge (UMFSB) framework to model unbalanced stochastic interaction dynamics from snapshot data. Inspired by this framework, we further propose CytoBridge, a deep learning algorithm designed to approximate the UMFSB problem. By explicitly modeling cellular transitions, proliferation, and interactions through neural networks, CytoBridge offers the flexibility to learn these processes directly from data. The effectiveness of our method has been extensively validated using both synthetic gene regulatory data and real scRNA-seq datasets. Compared to existing methods, CytoBridge identifies growth, transition, and interaction patterns, eliminates false transitions, and reconstructs the developmental landscape with greater accuracy. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/CytoBridge-NeurIPS.</description>

      <title>Variational Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Single Network, Least Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering the dynamics from a few snapshots of a high-dimensional system is a challenging task in statistical physics and machine learning, with important applications in computational biology. Many algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem, based on frameworks such as optimal transport and the Schr\"odinger bridge. A notable recent framework is Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (RUOT), which integrates both stochastic dynamics and unnormalized distributions. However, since many existing methods do not explicitly enforce optimality conditions, their solutions often struggle to satisfy the principle of least action and meet challenges to converge in a stable and reliable way. To address these issues, we propose Variational RUOT (Var-RUOT), a new framework to solve the RUOT problem. By incorporating the optimal necessary conditions for the RUOT problem into both the parameterization of the search space and the loss function design, Var-RUOT only needs to learn a scalar field to solve the RUOT problem and can search for solutions with lower action. We also examined the challenge of selecting a growth penalty function in the widely used Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric and proposed a solution that better aligns with biological priors in Var-RUOT. We validated the effectiveness of Var-RUOT on both simulated data and real single-cell datasets. Compared with existing algorithms, Var-RUOT can find solutions with lower action while exhibiting faster convergence and improved training stability. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZerooVector/VarRUOT.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Discovery of Neural Circuits in Spatially Patterned Neural Responses with Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring synaptic connectivity from neural population activity is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience, complicated by partial observability and mismatches between inference models and true circuit dynamics. In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data generated from ring attractor network models and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model reliably resolves spurious correlations and recovers accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.</description>

      <title>WhaleVAD-BPN: Improving Baleen Whale Call Detection with Boundary Proposal Networks and Post-processing Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent sound event detection (SED) systems can identify baleen whale calls in marine audio, challenges related to false positive and minority-class detection persist. We propose the boundary proposal network (BPN), which extends an existing lightweight SED system. The BPN is inspired by work in image object detection and aims to reduce the number of false positive detections. It achieves this by using intermediate latent representations computed within the backbone classification model to gate the final output. When added to an existing SED system, the BPN achieves a 16.8 % absolute increase in precision, as well as 21.3 % and 9.4 % improvements in the F1-score for minority-class d-calls and bp-calls, respectively. We further consider two approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of 0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.</description>
