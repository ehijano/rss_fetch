      <title>Advanced Data Analysis of Spontaneous Biophoton Emission: A Multi-Method Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) from living systems is widely hypothesized to reflect un-derlying self-organization and long-range coordination in biological dynamics. However, distin-guishing biologically driven correlations from trivial stochastic or instrumental effects requires a robust, multi-method framework. In this work, we establish and benchmark a comprehensive anal-ysis pipeline for photon-count time series, combining Distribution Entropy Analysis, R\'enyi entro-py, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, its generalization Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and tail-statistics characterization. Surrogate signals constructed from Poisson processes, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and Renewal Processes with power-law waiting times are used to validate sensitivity to memory, intermittency, and multifractality. Across all methods, a coherent hierarchy of dynamical regimes is recovered, demonstrating internal methodological consistency. Application to experimental dark-count data and attenuated coherent-laser emission confirm Poisson-like behavior, establishing an essential statistical baseline for UPE studies. The combined results show that this multi-resolution approach reliably separates trivial photon-counting statistics from struc-tured long-range organization, providing a validated methodological foundation for future biological UPE measurements and their interpretation in the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, information dynamics, and prospective markers of biological coherence.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>

Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Kinetics of mRNA Molecules in a General Transcription Model</title>

Abstract: Stochastic modeling of transcription is a classic yet long-standing problem in theoretical biophysics. The lack of unified results and a computationally efficient approach for a general, fine-grained transcription model has confined relevant research to some over-simplified special cases like the Telegraph model. This article establishes a general, unified and computationally efficient framework for studying stochastic transcription kinetics. We consider a chemical reaction model of transcription and construct the time-dependent solution to the corresponding chemical master equation. A well-known matrix-form expression for steady-state binomial moments is recovered by calculating the temporal limit of the time-dependent dynamics. Two novel inequalities for binomial moments and the probability mass function are derived using techniques from functional analysis. It follows that the distribution of mRNA counts is upper-bounded by a constant multiple of Poisson distribution, thus mathematically proving the main statement of the Heavy-Tailed Law. Additionally, the standard binomial moment method is analyzed from a numerical perspective, where truncation error is estimated using our inequalities. Compared with some widely-used numerical methods, a key advantage of this result is the significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Joint Probability Distribution of mRNA and Protein Molecules in a Stochastic Gene Expression Model</title>

Abstract: Stochastic modeling of gene expression is a classic problem in theoretical biophysics. However, models formulated via chemical master equation have long been considered analytically intractable unless burst approximation is applied. This article shows that general stochastic gene expression models with an arbitrary number of gene states admit direct analysis. Based on chemical master equation and high-dimensional binomial moment method, we derive recurrence relations for binomial moments in steady state, yielding analytical expressions to arbitrary order in a hierarchical manner. Subsequently, the joint probability mass function of mRNA and protein copy number can be reconstructed. An algorithm is developed for numerical computation. Particularly, explicit expressions for low-order cumulants are presented. Compared with models under burst approximation, the mean remains exact, whereas the variance typically differs. We estimate the difference between two second-order binomial moments using functional analysis, therefore evaluating the validity of burst approximation.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in active epithelia emerge from an interplay of mechanochemical feedback and crowding</title>

Abstract: Glassy dynamics in active biological cells remain a subject of debate, as cellular activity rarely slows enough for true glassy features to emerge. In this study, we address this paradox of glassy dynamics in epithelial cells by integrating experimental observations with an active vertex model. We demonstrate that while crowding is essential, it is not sufficient for glassy dynamics to emerge. A mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), mediated by cell shape changes through the contractile actomyosin network, is required to drive glass transition in dense epithelial tissues, as revealed via a crosstalk between actin-based cell clustering and dynamic heterogeneity in experiments. Incorporating MCFL into the vertex model reveals contrasting results from those previously predicted by theories -- that glassy dynamics can emerge even at high cellular activity if the strength of the MCFL remains high. We show that the MCFL can counteract cell division-induced fluidisation and enable glassy dynamics to emerge through active cell-to-cell communication. Furthermore, our analysis reveals, for the first time, the existence of novel collective mechanochemical oscillations that arise from the crosstalk of two MCFLs. Together, we demonstrate that an interplay between crowding and active mechanochemical feedback enables the emergence of glass-like traits and collective biochemical oscillations in epithelial tissues with active cell-cell contacts.</description>

      <title>Cyclic jetting enables microbubble-mediated drug delivery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of targeted therapies capable of overcoming biological barriers, including the tenacious blood-brain barrier, has spurred the investigation into stimuli-responsive microagents. This approach could improve therapeutic efficacy, reduce undesirable side effects, and open avenues for treating previously incurable diseases. Intravenously-administered ultrasound-responsive microbubbles are one of the most promising agents, having demonstrated potential in several clinical trials. However, the mechanism by which microbubbles enhance drug absorption remains unclear. Here, we reveal through unprecedented time-resolved side-view visualisations that single microbubbles, upon microsecond-long ultrasound driving, puncture the cell membrane and induce drug uptake via stable cyclic microjets. Our theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed bubble and cell dynamic responses. We find that cyclic jets arise from shape instabilities, warranting recognition as a novel class of jets in bubbles, distinct from classical inertial jets driven by pressure gradients. We also establish a threshold for bubble radial expansion beyond which microjets form and facilitate cellular permeation. Remarkably, these microjets occur at ultrasound pressures below 100kPa due to their unique formation mechanism. We show that the stress generated by microjetting surpasses all previously suggested mechanisms by at least an order of magnitude. In summary, this work elucidates the physics behind microbubble-mediated targeted drug delivery and provides criteria for its effective yet safe application.</description>
