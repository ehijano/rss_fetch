      <title>A note on metapopulation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metapopulation models are commonly used in ecology, evolution, and epidemiology. These models usually entail homogeneity assumptions within patches and study networks of migration between patches to generate insights into conservation of species, differentiation of populations, and persistence of infectious diseases. Here, focusing on infectious disease epidemiology, we take a complementary approach and study the effects of individual variation within patches while neglecting any form of disease transmission between patches. Consistently with previous work on single populations, we show how metapopulation models that neglect in-patch heterogeneity also underestimate basic reproduction numbers ($\mathcal{R}_{0}$) and the effort required to control or eliminate infectious diseases by uniform interventions. We then go beyond this confirmatory result and introduce a scheme to infer distributions of individual susceptibility or exposure to infection based on suitable stratifications of a population into patches. We apply the resulting metapopulation models to a simple case study of the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>Viral Hitchhikers and Macroevolution: A Novel Hypothesis on Explosive Speciation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile genetic elements (e.g., endogenous viruses, LINEs, SINEs) can transfer between genomes, even between species, triggering dramatic genetic changes. Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) arise when infectious viruses integrate into the host germline. EVEs integrate at specific sites; their genes or regulatory regions can be exapted and could induce chromosomal rearrangement. We propose that EVEs participate in adaptive radiations and that their parent viruses, through interspecific transfer, could initiate new species formation. By synchronously affecting multiple individuals, viral outbreaks generate shared genomic changes that both facilitate reproductive isolation and provide the simultaneous modifications needed for groups to emerge as founders of new species. We suggest horizontal viral transfer during the K-Pg accelerated mammalian radiation linking viral epidemics to macroevolutionary diversification. This theoretical work proposes endogenous viruses as catalysts for explosive speciation.</description>

      <title>Direct reciprocity in asynchronous interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation is vital for the survival of living systems but is challenging due to the costs borne by altruistic individuals. Direct reciprocity, where actions are based on past encounters, is a key mechanism fostering cooperation. However, most studies assume synchronous decision-making, whereas real-world interactions are often asynchronous, with individuals acting in sequence. This asynchrony can undermine standard cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat and Win-Stay Lose-Shift. To better understand cooperation in real-world contexts, it is crucial to explore the theory of direct reciprocity in asynchronous interactions. To address this, we introduce a framework based on asynchronous stochastic games, incorporating asynchronous decisions and dynamic environmental feedback. We analytically derive the conditions under which strategies form cooperative Nash equilibria. Our results demonstrate that the order of interactions can significantly alter outcomes: interaction asynchrony generally inhibits cooperation, except under specific conditions where environmental feedback effectively mitigates its negative impact. When environmental feedback is incorporated, a variety of stable reciprocal strategies can be sustained. Notably, above a critical environmental threshold, any cooperative strategy can form a Nash equilibrium. Overall, our work underscores the importance of interaction order in long-term evolutionary processes and highlights the pivotal role of environmental feedback in stabilizing cooperation in asynchronous interactions.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic noise in structured replicator dynamics modelling time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and analyze structured replicator dynamics of the Snowdrift game. In our model, the offspring is put in juvenile compartments and then mature and join adult compartments with strategy-dependent rates. This is augmented by death rates and hence the population size is bounded. In the corresponding birth-death Markov jump process, rates of leaving juvenile compartments may be interpreted as inverses of averages of exponentially distributed time delays. We observe a novel behavior: for equal average time delays of both strategies, the frequency of cooperators in the quasi-stationary state of a stochastic dynamics is bigger than that in the corresponding stationary state of the deterministic structured replicator dynamics which is actually equal to the critical point of the original replicator equation for the Snowdrift game. In short, time delays favor cooperation in the presence of intrinsic stochastic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Age-Structured Population Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter reviews some aspects of the theory of age-structured models of populations with finite maximum age. We formulate both the renewal equation for the birth rate and the partial differential equation for the age density, and show their equivalence. Next, we define and discuss central concepts in population dynamics, like the basic reproduction number $R_0$, the Malthusian parameter $r$, and the stable age distribution. We briefly review the sun-star theory that turns the birth term into a bounded additive perturbation, thus allowing to develop stability and bifurcation theory along standard lines. Finally, we review the pseudospectral approximation of the infinite-dimensional age-structured models by means of a finite system of ordinary differential equations, which allows to perform numerical bifurcation analysis with existing software tools. Here, Nicholson's blowfly equation serves as a worked example.</description>

      <title>Size-Structured Population Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on variable maturation delay or, more precisely, on the mathematical description of a size-structured population consuming an unstructured resource. When the resource concentration is a known function of time, we can describe the growth and survival of individuals quasi-explicitly, i.e., in terms of solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODE). Reproduction is captured by a (non-autonomous) renewal equation, which can be solved by generation expansion. After these preparatory steps, a contraction mapping argument is needed to construct the solution of the coupled consumer-resource system with prescribed initial conditions. As we shall show, this interpretation-guided constructive approach does in fact yield weak solutions of a familiar partial differential equation (PDE). A striking difficulty with the PDE approach is that the solution operators are, in general, not differentiable, precluding a linearized stability analysis of steady states. This is a manifestation of the state-dependent delay difficulty. As a (not entirely satisfactory and rather technical) way out, we present a delay equation description in terms of the history of both the $p$-level birth rate of the consumer population and the resource concentration. We end by using pseudospectral approximation to derive a system of ODE and demonstrating its use in a numerical bifurcation analysis. Importantly, the state-dependent delay difficulty dissolves in this approximation.</description>
