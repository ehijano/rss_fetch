      <title>Particle Levitation Velocimetry for boundary layer measurements in high Reynolds number liquid helium turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding boundary layer flows in high Reynolds number (Re) turbulence is crucial for advancing fluid dynamics in a wide range of applications, from improving aerodynamic efficiency in aviation to optimizing energy systems in industrial processes. However, generating such flows requires complex, power-intensive large-scale facilities. Furthermore, the use of local probes, such as hot wires and pressure sensors, often introduces disturbances due to the necessary support structures, compromising measurement accuracy. In this paper, we present a solution that leverages the vanishingly small viscosity of liquid helium to produce high Re flows, combined with an innovative Particle Levitation Velocimetry (PLV) system for precise flow-field measurements. This PLV system uses magnetically levitated superconducting micro-particles to measure the near-wall velocity field in liquid helium. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the PLV system enables quantitative measurements of the velocity boundary layer over a wall unit range of $44\le y^{+}\le 4400$, with a spatial resolution that, depending on the particle size, can reach down to about 10~$\mu$m. This development opens new avenues for exploring turbulence structures and correlations within the thin boundary layer that would be otherwise difficult to achieve.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the confinement string in (2 + 1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics with a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>

Abstract: Compact lattice Quantum Electrodynamics is a complex quantum field theory with dynamical gauge and matter fields and it has similarities with Quantum Chromodynamics, in particular asymptotic freedom and confinement. We consider a (2+1)-dimensional lattice discretization of Quantum Electrodynamics with the inclusion of dynamical fermionic matter. We define a suitable quantum algorithm to measure the static potential as a function of the distance between two charges on the lattice and we use a variational quantum calculation to explore the Coulomb, confinement and string breaking regimes. A symmetry-preserving and resource-efficient variational quantum circuit is employed to prepare the ground state of the theory at various values of the coupling constant, corresponding to different physical distances, allowing the accurate extraction of the static potential from a quantum computer. We demonstrate that results from quantum experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion device and emulator, with full connectivity between qubits, agree with classical noiseless simulations using circuits with 10 and 24 qubits. Moreover, we visualize the electric field flux configurations that mostly contribute in the wave-function of the quantum ground state in the different regimes of the potential, thus giving insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking. These results are a promising step forward in the grand challenge of solving higher dimensional lattice gauge theory problems with quantum computing algorithms.</description>
