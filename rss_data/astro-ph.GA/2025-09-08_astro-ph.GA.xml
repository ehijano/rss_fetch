      <title>Characterizing the roles of transitory obscured phases and inner torus in shaping the fractions of obscured AGN at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of obscuration in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is still a matter of contention. It is unclear whether obscured AGN are primarily due to line-of-sight effects, a transitory, dust-enshrouded phase in galaxy evolution, or a combination of both. The role of an inner torus around the central SMBH also remains unclear in pure Evolution models. We use cosmological semi-analytic models and semi-empirical prescriptions to explore obscuration effects in AGN at 1&lt;z&lt;3. We consider a realistic object-by-object modelling of AGN evolution including different light curves (LCs) composed of phases of varying levels of obscuration, mimicking the possible clearing effects of strong AGN feedback. Evolution models characterized by AGN LCs with relatively short pre-peak obscured phases followed by more extended optical/UV visible post-peak phases, struggle to reproduce the high fraction of obscured AGN at z~2-3 inferred from X-ray surveys. Evolution models characterised by LCs with sharp post-peak declines or persistent or multiple obscuration phases are more successful, although they still face challenges in reproducing the steady drop in the fractions of obscured AGN with increasing luminosity measured by some groups. Invoking a fine-tuning in the input LCs, with more luminous AGN defined by longer optical/UV visible windows, can improve the match to the decreasing fractions of obscured AGN with luminosity. Alternatively, a long-lived central torus-like component, with thickness decreasing with increasing AGN power, naturally boosts the luminosity-dependent fractions of obscured AGN, suggesting that small-scale orientation effects may still represent a key component even in Evolution models. We also find that in our models major mergers and starbursts, when considered in isolation, fall short in accounting for the large fractions of highly obscured faint AGN detected at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Wide binaries in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy: discovery, population modeling, and a nail in the coffin of primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bo\"{o}tes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Bo\"{o}tes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>The orbital anisotropy profile of the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus accretion remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GS/E) accretion remnant is one of the most important stellar populations in the Milky Way halo. Recent simulation-based work has suggested that the anisotropy profiles of remnants like GS/E decline towards the center and may be well-fit by an Osipkov-Merritt-type distribution function (DF). We study the anisotropy profile of GS/E using a chemically-selected sample of stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia. We find that the anisotropy profile of GS/E is high and constant with $\beta \sim 0.9$ beyond 8 kpc, dropping to $\beta \sim 0.4$ at 2 kpc. We fit a two-component Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy profile to the GS/E data, finding that a combination of profiles with scale radii $r_{\mathrm{a}}=2$ kpc and 547 kpc, with a mixture fraction $k_\mathrm{om} = 0.88$ provide a better fit to the data than a constant anisotropy profile. Using this new DF, we re-assess the density profile and mass of the GS/E remnant from a previous work that assumed a contant-anisotropy DF, finding an increase in the derived mass from $1.5\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to $2.29 ^{+0.95}_{-0.63}\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In general, the combination Osipkov-Merritt DF more satisfactorily matches the kinematics of the GS/E remnant than the constant anisotropy DF, and in the future will form a more reliable basis for modelling the remnant. Additionally, these new constraints on the kinematics of GS/E near the Galactic center are an important measurement for any future theoretical or simulation-based investigation into its nature and origin.</description>

      <title>X-ray investigation of possible super-Eddington accretion in a radio-loud quasar at $z=6.13$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radio and X-ray observations of the recently discovered $z=6.13$ radio-powerful quasar RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 using uGMRT, ATCA, LBA, and Chandra. The observed radio properties are in line with what is typically observed in high-$z$ radio quasars ($\alpha_{\rm r}=0.72\pm 0.02$ and L$_{\rm 1.4GHz}=5.8 \pm 0.9 \times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). Despite the relatively low X-ray flux observed $F_{\rm 0.5-7.0 keV}=2.3\pm0.5 \times 10^{-14}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, the intrinsic luminosity in the 2-10 keV rest frame is markedly high, $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}=1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7} \times 10^{46}$ erg sec$^{-1}$, making RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 one of the most luminous quasars currently known at $z&gt;5.5$. The high X-ray luminosity is largely driven by an extrapolation to energies below the observable X-ray window with Chandra and the slope derived in the 0.5-7 keV band (or 3.5--50 keV in the rest-frame; $\Gamma_{\rm X}=3.3\pm0.4$). By analysing the overall spectral energy distribution of the quasar we found that the remarkably soft X-ray emission: (1) cannot be produced by relativistic jets, even when relativistic boosting is considered; and (2) is consistent with expectations for a super-Eddington accreting SMBH. If such a high accretion rate was confirmed, this source would be a unique laboratory to study high accretion in the early Universe and could help resolve some challenges inherent in early black hole growth paradigms.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Stellar Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review our current understanding of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs), rotating, and flattened stellar structures found in the central regions of both early- and late-type galaxies. We examine their demographics, kinematics, stellar populations, metallicity gradients and star formation histories. We derive scaling relations linking NSDs to properties of their host galaxies, and compare them with analogous relations for nuclear star clusters. The relationship between NSDs and other central galactic components, including nuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear star clusters, is explored. The role of NSDs as tracers of the secular evolution of barred galaxies is highlighted, emphasising how they can be used to constrain properties of galactic bars such as their ages. Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves as a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve individual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics, dynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of a nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue that NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven gas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas during a gas-rich merger. The review concludes by outlining open questions, future research directions and the exciting prospects provided by upcoming observational facilities.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope H{\sc i} 21\,cm imaging of the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) \hii\ imaging of NGC\,4141, the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A at $z=0.0063$. Our GMRT \hii\ images have spatial resolutions, at $z\approx0.0063$, of $\approx0.48-8.0$~kpc, and find evidence for (i)~a companion galaxy, LEDA\,2582852, to the south-west, (ii)~a nearby (27-kpc distant) H{\sc{i}} cloud to the south-west, (iii)~disturbances in the H{\sc{i}} distributions of both NGC\,4141 and LEDA\,2582852, and (iv)~high H{\sc{i}} column densities in the south-western outskirts of NGC\,4141. A Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum shows evidence for a low metallicity and a high star-formation rate (SFR) surface density activity in the south-western disk of NGC\,4141, while H$\alpha$-based SFR estimates over the last 10~Myr are higher than radio-based SFRs over the last 100~Myr. The above evidence indicates that NGC\,4141 has recently acquired metal-poor gas, via either a merger or accretion, that resulted in the south-western starburst and that may have also triggered large-scale star-formation activity in NGC\,4141, resulting in the formation of the stellar progenitor of FRB\,20250316A and the other transients. Our highest-resolution (480~pc) GMRT H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm image finds no H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from the location of FRB\,20250316A or the nearby star-forming region, suggesting that most of the H{\sc{i}} here has been either ionized or converted into the molecular phase. Our non-detection of continuum emission at the location of FRB\,20250316A yields the $3\sigma$ upper limit $&lt;3.2\times10^{25}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$, on the 1.4~GHz specific luminosity of a putative persistent radio source associated with FRB\,20250316A, one of the strongest constraints on the radio luminosity of such an associated persistent radio source.</description>

      <title>The atomic gas properties of Green Pea galaxies: Connections to Lyman continuum leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the Green Bank Telescope to search for H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from 30 Green Pea galaxies (GPs) at $z\approx0.012-0.045$, obtaining 7 detections of H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission and 17 upper limits on the H{\sc{i}} mass. Including GPs from the literature, we obtain a sample of 60 GPs at $z&lt;0.05$, with 19 detections and 41 non-detections of H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission, and with stellar masses in the range $10^6-10^9\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$. We use the line luminosity ratio O32~$\equiv$~[O{\sc iii}]$\lambda 5007+\lambda 4959$/[O{\sc ii}]$\lambda$3727,3729 as an indicator of Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage, and examine the dependence of the H{\sc{i}} properties of the 60 GPs on the O32 ratio. We obtain a far higher H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm detection rate ($\approx53^{+16}_{-13}$\%) for the 32 GPs with O32~$&lt;10$ than that ($7.1^{+9.4}_{-4.6}$\%) for the 28 GPs with O32~$&gt;10$. We find statistically significant evidence that the H{\sc{i}} mass, the H{\sc{i}}-to-stellar mass ratio, and the H{\sc{i}} gas depletion timescale of GPs with O32~$&gt;10$ are lower than the corresponding values for GPs with O32~$&lt;10$. Earlier studies have shown that galaxies with O32~$&gt;10$ tend to show significant LyC leakage: our results indicate that this is due to the lack of H{\sc{i}} in such galaxies, with most of the H{\sc{i}} consumed in the starburst. Our results further suggest that H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm studies of the galaxies that reionized the Universe at $z\gtrsim6$ are likely to find an anti-correlation between the H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm and Ly$\alpha$ emission signals, due to the paucity of H{\sc{i}} in the strongest LyC and Ly$\alpha$ leakers.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V LVM: Detectability of Wolf-Rayet stars and their He II ionizing flux in low-metallicity environments I. The weak-lined, early-type WN3 stars in the SMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the nearest low-metallicity dwarf galaxy. Its proximity and low reddening has enabled us to detect its Wolf-Rayet (WR) star population with 12 known objects. Quantitative spectroscopy of the stars revealed half of these WR stars to be strong sources of He ii ionizing flux, but the average metallicity of the SMC is below where WR bumps are usually detected in integrated galaxy spectra showing nebular He ii emission. Utilizing the Local Volume Mapper (LVM), we investigate regions around the six SMC WN3h stars, whose winds are thin enough to avoid He recombination and allow photons with &gt; 54 eV to escape. Focusing on He ii 4686 {\AA}, we show that the broad stellar wind component, the strongest optical diagnostic of the WN3h stars, is diluted within 24 pc in the integrated light from LVM, making the WR stars hard to detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He ii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases reflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN stars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He ii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar signatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H &lt; 8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess of nebular He ii emission. This constitutes a challenge for population synthesis models across all redshifts as the evolutionary path towards this observed WR population at low metallicity remains enigmatic.</description>

      <title>Re-assessing the stellar population scaling relations of the galaxies in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local galaxies follow scaling relations between mass and stellar population properties such as age and metallicity, which encode key information on their evolutionary histories. We revise these relations using the largest spectroscopic dataset from SDSS DR7 (0.005&lt;z&lt;0.22), improved Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models, aperture-corrections, and statistical weights to account for selection biases. In a Bayesian framework, we estimate stellar masses, mean ages, and metallicities by comparing spectral indices and photometry with composite SPS models. We adopt updated prescriptions for Star Formation Histories (SFH) and Chemical Enrichment Histories (CEH), while also testing different models and priors. We measure light-weighted ages for 354,977 galaxies (SNR&gt;10) and metallicities for 89,852 galaxies (SNR&gt;20), analyzing their dependence on stellar mass. Key findings include: i) A revised bimodal mass-age distribution, with a young sequence at low mass and an old sequence at high mass, partly overlapping in mass and transitioning at 10^10.8 solar masses. ii) A Mass-Metallicity Relation (MZR) shifted upwards by 0.2 dex relative to previous works. Aperture corrections lower masses, ages, and metallicities in a mass-dependent way, enhancing the young sequence and steepening the MZR. iii) Using Halpha-based SFRs, we found that while star-forming/young and quiescent/old correspondences generally hold, exceptions exist for many galaxies. Quiescent galaxies show a flatter, less scattered MZR than star-forming ones, with convergence at high mass. iv) SPS assumptions strongly affect our results, particularly SFHs and CEHs. These revised relations provide new benchmarks for galaxy evolution studies and simulations. Systematic uncertainties of 0.15 dex may arise from aperture biases and SPS modelling choices, highlighting the need for consistent assumptions when comparing observations and models.</description>

      <title>Witnessing the violent, merger-driven formation of an extremely massive galaxy 1.7 Gyr after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine near-infrared imaging in two bands from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with archival observations of molecular gas to study SDSS J160705.16+533558.6 (J1607), an extremely luminous broad-line quasar at $z = 3.65$ that is also bright in the submillimeter (sub-mm). Via subtraction of the quasar point spread function, we show that its host galaxy is massive, with a stellar mass of $(5.8 \pm 3.0) \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, making it comparable to giant early-type galaxies (ETGs) at $z\sim0$. If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the quasar is accreting at the Eddington limit, then its mass is $3.5 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is also consistent with local massive ETGs. The host has an extremely high star formation rate (SFR) of $4300 \pm 500$\sfr and a molecular gas mass of $(2.4 \pm 0.9)\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. The quasar has two companions: one at a projected separation of 11 kpc with a stellar mass of $(7.9 \pm 5.0) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no detected molecular gas, and one 6 kpc further away in the same direction with a molecular gas mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.3) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no detected stellar emission. Since neither companion shows evidence for AGN activity, this may represent merger-driven quenching, in which the dynamics of the merger strip molecular gas from infalling galaxies. Overall, irrespective of whether the host is merging with the companions, these properties mark J1607 as forming what will become an extremely massive ($\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$) galaxy by $z=0$.</description>

      <title>On the connection between nitrogen-enhanced field stars and the Galactic globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As sites of some of the most efficient star formation in the Universe, globular clusters (GCs) have long been hypothesized to be the building blocks of young galaxies. Within the Milky Way, our best tracers of the contribution of GCs to the proto-Galaxy are stars with such anomalous overabundance in nitrogen and depletion in oxygen ("high-[N/O] stars") that they can be identified as having originated in a cluster long after they have escaped. We identify associations between these high-[N/O] field stars and GCs using integrals of motion and metallicities and compare to chemically typical halo stars to quantify any excess association, enabling a population-level exploration of the formation sites of the nitrogen-enhanced stars in the field. Relative to the halo as a whole, high-[N/O] stars show stronger associations with the most initially massive, inner Galaxy GCs, suggesting that many nitrogen-rich stars formed in these environments. However, when compared to a sample matched in orbital energy, the excess largely disappears: high-[N/O] stars are, on average, no more associated with surviving GCs than energy-matched halo stars, despite their [N/O] abundances indicating GC origins, consistent with a scenario in which a substantial fraction of low-energy inner-halo stars originate in GCs, so an energy-matched control dilutes any differential excess. We argue that associations between high-[N/O] stars and their parent GCs are further weakened because dynamical friction and the Galactic bar have altered integrals of motion, limiting the reliability of precise present-day associations and, especially, individual star-to-cluster tagging.</description>

      <title>Resolving Emission from Small Dust Grains in the Blue Compact Dwarf II Zw 40 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral-field spectroscopy of the nearby blue compact dwarf II Zw 40, which has a low metallicity of 25% of solar. Leveraging the high spatial/spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of JWST/NIRSpec, we present robust detections of the 3.3 um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission on 20 pc scales. The strength of the Pf delta emission relative to the 3.3 PAH feature is significantly stronger than typical higher metallicity star-forming galaxies. We find that 3.3 um PAH emission is concentrated near the northern super star cluster and is co-spatial with CO gas. A strong correlation exists between the 3.3/11.3 PAH ratio and radiation hardness probed by NeIII/NeII, providing evidence of photodestruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation environments. Our analysis shows that while the overall PAH fraction is lower in II Zw 40 than in higher metallicity galaxies, the contribution of the 3.3 um PAH feature to the total PAH emission is higher. We propose that the PAH size distribution is fundamentally shaped by two competing mechanisms in low-metallicity environments: photo-destruction and inhibited growth. Additionally, the high radiation field intensity in II Zw 40 suggests that multi-photon heating of PAHs may be an important effect. As one of the first spatially resolved studies of aromatic emission in a low-metallicity environment, our spectroscopic results offer practical guidance for future observations of the 3.3 um PAH feature in low-metallicity galaxies using JWST.</description>

      <title>Turbulence from CO observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence influences the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds, and plays a key role in regulating star formation. We therefore need methods to accurately infer turbulence properties of molecular clouds from position-position-velocity (PPV) spectral observations. A previous method calibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin conditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the present study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence turbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the first-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO results with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT impact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity dispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO, with R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88 (+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line. As a consequence, previous measurements of sigma_v were overestimated by about 10-15% on average, with potential overestimates as high as 40%, taking the 1-sigma uncertainty into account.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of ISM proper motion with image registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, quantification of the on-sky motion for interstellar clouds have relied on proxies such as young stellar objects (YSO) and masers. We present the first direct measurement of an interstellar cloud proper motion using the VISTA Star Formation Atlas (VISIONS) multi-epoch infrared images of the Corona Australis star-forming region. Proper motions are extracted by tracking the morphology of extended structures in the cloud complex based on image registration techniques implemented in SimpleITK. Our determined values ($\mu_{\alpha^*} \sim +15$ mas/yr, $\mu_{\delta} \sim -30$ mas/yr) are in good agreement with those obtained for YSOs and young stellar clusters in the region. This study demonstrates the potential of image registration for directly mapping the kinematics of nearby molecular clouds, opening a new window into the study of cloud dynamics.</description>

      <title>CO Depletion in Infrared Dark Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense structures representative of the initial conditions of star formation. Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to investigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas phase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great interest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw material for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward four IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust temperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps to measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70, G24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion factor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer, lower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and f_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO depletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\sim$10 in regions with $n_H&gt;3\times10^5\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter at a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with temperature, rising rapidly for temperatures &lt;18 K. We propose a functional form $f_D^\prime = \:{exp}(T_0/[T_{dust}-T_1])$ with $T_0\simeq4\:$K and $T_1\simeq12\:$K to reproduce this behaviour. We conclude that CO is heavily depleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion can lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by factors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption in setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing important constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical history of gas during the early stages of star formation.</description>

      <title>Off-lattice Microscopic Monte Carlo Modeling of Molecular Hydrogen Formation on Carbonaceous Dust Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an off-lattice Monte Carlo model of accretion and migration of hydrogen atoms on a rough surface of carbon dust grain. The migration of physisorbed atoms by means of thermal diffusion and quantum tunnelling through barriers between the surface potential minima is considered. The model is applied to simulations of molecular hydrogen formation in a cold interstellar medium for a temperature range 5-35 K. Eley-Rideal and Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms for the formation of the H$_2$ molecule were taken into account. We found that the surface potential energy minima that hold the accreted hydrogen atoms (binding energy) has wide dispersion of its values. The minimum energy is three times smaller than the maximum energy for the uneven surface of the model grain. The large dispersion of the binding energies results in an extended range of temperatures where H$_2$ formation is efficient: 5-25 K. The dispersion of binding energies also reduces efficiency of diffusion due to tunnelling in comparison to that assumed in kinetic equation codes in which constant values of binding energies are employed. Thus, thermal hopping is the main source for the mobility of the hydrogen atoms in the presented off-lattice model. Finally, the model naturally provides the mean values for the ratio of binding-to-desorption energy. This ratio demonstrates weak dependence on temperature and is in the range of 0.5-0.6.</description>

      <title>Survey of Profile Parameters of the $6196 \AA$ Diffuse Interstellar Band. From Uniform Profiles to Doppler Splitting and Blueshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse interstellar band (DIB) at 6196 A exhibits notable profile variations across the Milky Way. This study addresses three open issues: the unusual broadening of the DIB profile towards Upper Sco (USco), the lack of profile variations towards stars near $\eta$ Car, and the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1. Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars across the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the DIB's profile parameters. Our analysis identified Doppler-split components within the DIB profiles across most regions with no evidence for these splits being able to account for the observed broadening (23 km/s) in USco or other regions such as Orion, Vela OB2, and Melotte 20 ($\alpha$ Per cluster). We propose that neither the ages of the studied stellar populations nor the distances between clusters and nearby clouds significantly contribute to the broadening. However, we detect a gradient in the full width at half maximum within the Sco-Cen and Orion regions, where broadening decreases with distance from the star-forming centres. This result points to a possible connection between the DIB broadening and star formation (likely via the impact of recent supernovae). Regarding the Carina Nebula, we confirm the lack of DIB profile variations in a small region near $\eta$ Car, although an adjacent southern area exhibits significant variations, comparable to those in USco. In addition to the Carina Nebula, we find that the Rosette Nebula and NGC 6405 also show consistently narrow profiles (&lt;20 km/s) with minimal deviations from the median over spatial scales of a few parsecs. Finally, regarding the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1, we used a comparison with the Lagoon Nebula and argue that the most natural explanation is the presence of an unresolved kinematic component in the profile of the DIB, shifting the measured centre of the band.</description>

      <title>Deep polarimetry study reveals double ring ORC-like structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New observations with the current generation of advanced radio interferometers, such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, have led to the discovery of new classes of extended radio sources of unknown origin, including the so-called Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). These phenomena are detected exclusively in the radio continuum, with no clear counterparts at other wavelengths, making their physical nature and origin a subject of ongoing investigation. To better understand these objects, we study their radio continuum emission, spectral characteristics, and magnetic field properties. In this work, we present a radio spectropolarimetry analysis of a newly discovered ORC (ORC J0356-4216) that exhibits a rare double-ring morphology. We use data from the MeerKAT L-band and from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) at 943 MHz. ORC J0356-4216 shows a symmetric double-ring structure with a diameter of approximately 2 arcminutes, corresponding to a physical size of 668 kpc based on the redshift ($0.494 \pm 0.068$) of its apparent host galaxy WISEA J035609.67-421603.5. The radio spectra of both rings are steep, with spectral indices of $-1.18 \pm 0.03$ and $-1.12 \pm 0.05$, and show no significant substructure. Equipartition magnetic field strengths (assuming K0 = 1) are estimated to be 1.82 microGauss and 1.65 microGauss for the respective rings. The degree of polarisation across the object ranges between 20-30%, consistent with a non-thermal synchrotron origin. The morphology and polarisation are broadly consistent with large-scale shocks driven by powerful starburst outflows. However, the high degree of symmetry, the coherent double-ring structure, and the absence of internal substructure are features commonly associated with relic AGN lobes, making this scenario particularly compatible with the observed characteristics.</description>

      <title>The diverse quenching pathways of post-starburst galaxies in SDSS-IV MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quenching of star formation in galaxies is an important aspect of galaxy evolution, but the physical mechanisms that drive it are still not understood. Measuring the spatial distribution of quenching can help determine these mechanisms. We present the star-formation histories (SFHs) and stellar metallicity evolution of rapidly quenched regions in 86 local post-starburst (PSB) galaxies from the MaNGA integral field survey, obtained through Bayesian full spectral fitting of their rest-frame optical spectra. We found that regardless of spatial location, the PSB regions have similar past SFHs and chemical evolution, once radial metallicity gradients are accounted for. This suggests that all PSB regions are regulated by a common set of local scale processes in the interstellar medium, regardless of the broader triggering mechanism. We show that the centres of galaxies with outer PSB regions are also quenching. The central specific star-formation rate (sSFR) has declined by $\sim1.0\;$dex on average during the last 2 Gyr, a significantly steeper decline than main sequence galaxies over the same period ($\approx0.2\;$dex). This central quenching can be either synchronous, outside-in or inside-out, and slower or as fast as the outer regions, highlighting the diversity of quenching pathways for local galaxies. Our results imply a primary quenching mechanism that is both catastrophic and global in rapidly halting star formation in local galaxies. We suggest the predominant cause is galaxy mergers or interactions, with large scale feedback from a starburst or a central supermassive black hole playing a lesser role.</description>

      <title>A hybrid active galactic nucleus feedback model with spinning black holes, winds and jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model that features three accretion disc states (the thick, thin, and slim discs at low, moderate, and super-Eddington accretion rates, respectively), and two feedback modes: thermal isotropic and kinetic jets. The model includes black hole (BH) spin evolution due to gas accretion, BH mergers, jet spindown, and Lense-Thirring torques. The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects the feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and coupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model. We present the first results from hybrid AGN feedback simulations run as part of the COLIBRE suite, focusing on the impact of new parameters and calibration efforts. Using the new hybrid AGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive galaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\approx10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. BH spins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), and lower for other BH masses. These trends are in good agreement with observations. The intergalactic medium is hotter and impacted on larger scales in the hybrid AGN feedback simulations compared to those using purely thermal feedback. In the hybrid AGN simulations, we predict that half of the cumulative injected AGN energy is in thermal and the other half in jet form, broadly independent of BH mass and redshift. Jet feedback is important at all redshifts and dominates over thermal feedback at $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1.5$, but only mildly.</description>

      <title>Multi-color characterization of optically invisible FU Orionis-type outbursts: Demonstration and prospects for the WINTER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Episodic mass accretion is the dominant mechanism for mass assembly in the proto-stellar phase. Although prior optical time-domain searches have allowed detailed studies of individual outbursts, these searches remain insensitive to the earliest stages of star formation. In this paper, we present the characterization of two FU Orionis (FUor) outbursts identified using the combination of the ground-based, near-infrared Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) and the space-based, mid-infrared NEOWISE survey. Supplemented with near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up, we show that both objects are bona fide FUor type outbursts based on i) their proximity to star-forming regions, ii) large amplitude (2-4 magnitudes) infrared brightening over the last decade, iii) progenitor colors consistent with embedded (Class I) protostars, and iv) "mixed-temperature" infrared spectra exhibiting characteristic signatures of cool outer envelopes and a hot inner disk with a wind. While one source, WNTR24-cua, is a known FUor which we independently recover; the second source, WNTR24-egv, is a newly confirmed object. Neither source is detected in contemporaneous ground-based optical imaging, despite flux limits $\gtrsim 100\times$ fainter than their infrared brightness, demonstrating the capabilities of WINTER to identify heavily obscured young stellar object (YSO) outbursts.

      <title>PRIMA survey of the Virgo cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies are unique laboratories for investigating the dependence of galaxy evolution on their environment. The Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) mapped the central 84 square degrees region of the Virgo Cluster in five bands between 100 and 500 micron, which resulted in the first detailed view of cold dust in cluster galaxies. Major limitations of the HeViCS survey were the lack of data, or its limited availability, in the 20 to 80 micron range, and the quite low sensitivity of the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer instrument, resulting in poor constraints on the warmer dust component. The PRIMAger instrument onboard PRIMA offers the capability to map a large portion of the Virgo Cluster -- including regions beyond its virial radius -- in hyperspectral and polarimetric bands from 25 to 265 micron, enabling a direct comparison with the area previously covered by HeViCS. By combining PRIMA and Herschel data with existing multi-wavelength photometry, it becomes possible to explore the connection between stellar and dust properties in a complete sample of cluster galaxies, to investigate environmental effects on the warm dust component within the Virgo Cluster, to map the magnetic field structure of the cold interstellar medium (ISM), to search for dust emission from the intra-cluster medium, and to study the ISM in background galaxies projected behind the cluster.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Accreting Planetary-Mass Companion with Signs of Disk-Disk Interaction in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the \textit{PDRs4All} Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80\,pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately $7 \pm 3$ Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of $ \sim 20~M_{\rm Jup}$. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H$\alpha$ line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of $\sim$10$^{-6.5 \pm 0.7}~\rm M_{Jup}\,yr^{-1}$, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at 7320 and 7330~\AA, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage to the Hubble Space Telescope during two Solar cycles, and correction of Charge Transfer Inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all annealed into one of three configurations. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.</description>

      <title>An emulator-based forecasting on astrophysics and cosmology with 21 cm and density cross-correlations during EoR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21 cm signal arising from fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field, and its cross-correlation with other tracers of cosmic density, are promising probes of the high-redshift Universe. In this study, we assess the potential of the 21 cm power spectrum, along with its cross power spectrum with dark matter density and associated bias, to constrain both astrophysics during the reionization era and the underlying cosmology. Our methodology involves emulating these estimators using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space. Utilizing a photon-conserving semi-numerical reionization model, we construct emulators at a fixed redshift ($z = 7.0$) for $k$-modes relevant to upcoming telescopes such as SKA-Low. We generate $\sim7000$ training samples by varying both cosmological and astrophysical parameters along with initial conditions, achieving high accuracy when compared to true simulation outputs. While forecasting, the model involves five free parameters: three cosmological ($\Omega_m$, $h$, $\sigma_8$) and two astrophysical (ionizing efficiency, $\zeta$, and minimum halo mass, $M_{\mathrm{min}}$). Using a fiducial model at the mid-reionization stage, we create a mock dataset and perform forecasting with the trained emulators. Assuming a 5% observational uncertainty combined with emulator error, we find that the 21 cm and 21 cm-density cross power spectra can constrain the Hubble parameter ($h$) to better than 6% at a confidence interval of 95%, with tight constraints on the global neutral fraction ($Q_{\mathrm{HI}}$). The inclusion of bias information further improves constraints on $\sigma_8$ (&lt; 10% at 95% confidence). Finally, robustness tests with two alternate ionization states and a variant with higher observational uncertainty show that the ionization fractions are still reliably recovered, even when cosmological constraints weaken.</description>

      <title>Gaseous disks in white dwarfs: properties of the current sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the number of white dwarfs (WDs) showing infrared (IR) excesses, attributed to circumstellar dust disks, has grown significantly. Gaseous disks have also been detected in some WDs with dust. We obtained optical spectra with Gemini/GMOS for thirteen WDs exhibiting IR excesses to search for gaseous components. No Ca II emission was detected, suggesting the gas phase may be short-lived compared to the dusty stage. Combining our data with literature, we compiled the largest sample of WDs with and without gas disks. We find no significant differences in stellar properties between the two groups, although disks with gas may be, on average, brighter. The detection rate of Ca II emission supports the idea that the gas phase persists for only a fraction of the total disk lifetime. A more definitive assessment will likely require dedicated searches for both gas and dust across large WD samples.</description>

      <title>Extreme Negative Polarisation of New Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first polarimetric observations of the third discovered interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), obtained pre-perihelion with FORS2/VLT, ALFOSC/NOT, and FoReRo2/RCC, over a phase angle range of 7.7-22.4{\deg}. This marks the second ever polarimetric study of an interstellar object, the first distinguishing 2I/Borisov from most Solar System comets by its higher positive polarisation. Our polarimetric measurements as a function of phase angle reveal that 3I is characterised by an deep and narrow negative polarisation branch, reaching a minimum value of -2.7% at phase angle 7{\deg}, and an inversion angle of 17{\deg} -- a combination unprecedented among asteroids and comets, including 2I/Borisov. At very small phase angles, the extrapolated slope of the polarisation phase curve is consistent with that of certain small trans-Neptunian objects and Centaur Pholus, consistent with independent spectroscopic evidence for a red, possibly water-ice-bearing object. Imaging confirms a diffuse coma present from our earliest observations, though no strong polarimetric features are spatial resolved. These findings may demonstrate that 3I represents a distinct type of comet, expanding the diversity of known interstellar bodies.</description>

      <title>Marginal IR running of Gravity as a Natural Explanation for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a simple and universal explanation for large--distance modifications of gravity relevant to dark matter phenomenology. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we model $G(k)$ as a scale--dependent coupling governed by an anomalous dimension $\eta$. We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum--field--theoretic scaling. This provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that galactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as manifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Grain alignment and dust evolution physics with polarisation (GRADE-POL). I. Dust polarisation modelling for isolated starless cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarisation of light induced by aligned interstellar dust serves as a significant tool in investigating cosmic magnetic fields, dust properties, and poses a challenge in characterising the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background and other sources. To establish dust polarisation as a reliable tool, the physics of the grain alignment process needs to be studied thoroughly. The Magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) alignment is the only mechanism that can induce highly efficient alignment of grains with magnetic fields required by polarisation observations of the diffuse interstellar medium. Our numerical modelling of dust polarisation using the MRAT theory demonstrated that the alignment efficiency of starlight polarisation ($p_{\rm ext}/A_{\rm V}$) and the degree of thermal dust polarisation ($p_{\rm em}$) first decrease slowly with increasing visual extinction ($A_{\rm V}$) and then falls steeply as $\propto A^{-1}_{\rm V}$ at large $A_{\rm V}$ due to the loss of grain alignment, which explains the phenomenon known as polarisation holes. Visual extinction at the transition from shallow to steep slope ($A^{\rm loss}_{\rm V}$) increases with the maximum grain size. By applying physical profiles suitable for a starless core 109 in the Pipe Nebula (Pipe-109), our model successfully reproduces the existing observations of starlight polarisation at R-band ($0.65\,\mu$m) and H-band ($1.65\,\mu$m), as well as emission polarisation at submillimetre ($870\,\mu$m). Successful modelling of observational data requires perfect alignment of large grains as evidence of the MRAT mechanism, and larger maximum size with higher elongation at higher $A_{\rm V}$. The latter reveals the first evidence for the new model of anisotropic grain growth induced by magnetic grain alignment.</description>

      <title>Is there a tilt in the fundamental (hyper)plane?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental plane (FP) of selected early-type (ETG) member galaxies of the galaxy cluster PLCK G287.0+32.9 ($ z_c = 0.3833 $), exploring also four-dimensional hyperplane extensions. We measure ETGs structural parameters and photometry from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We use high-quality spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to measure the galaxy central stellar velocity dispersions and stellar population properties. With this data, we construct the FP through a robust fitting procedure and analyze its tilt and scatter. We then introduce two hyperplane extensions, one including the stellar mass ($M^\star$-HP) and another including the stellar over total mass fraction ($f_{\mathrm{e}}^\star$-HP), and compare their coefficients and scatter to those of the FP. The FP of PLCK G287.0+32.9 is found to have best-fit parameter values consistent with those in the literature ($\alpha = 1.2 \pm 0.1$ and $\beta = -0.75 \pm 0.05$), with a scatter of $0.09$ dex. The ($f_{\mathrm{e}}^\star$-HP) shows no tilt compared to the theoretical plane ($\alpha = 2.1 \pm 0.2$ and $\beta = -1.12 \pm 0.07$), with a scatter of $0.042$ dex, and the ($M^\star$-HP) reveals an even tighter relation, with a scatter of only $0.023$. Our findings support the idea that the FP is a lower-dimensional projection of a more complex hyperplane and confirm that the variations in the dark matter content contribute significantly to the tilt of the FP. Future studies incorporating larger samples of galaxies and additional physical parameters may further refine our understanding of the FP and its higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>A rapid channel for the collisional formation and gravitational wave driven mergers of supermassive black hole seeds at high redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by JWST observations of dense, clumpy and clustered high redshift star formation, we simulate the hierarchical assembly of nine $M_{\mathrm{cl}}=10^6 M_\odot$ star clusters using the BIFROST N-body code. Our low metallicity models ($0.01Z_\odot$) with post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes include evolving populations of single, binary and triple stars. Massive stars grow by stellar collisions and collapse into intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) up to $M_\mathrm{\bullet}\sim6200 M_\odot$, stellar multiplicity boosting the IMBH masses by a factor of $2$--$3$. The IMBHs tidally disrupt (TDE) $\sim50$ stars in $10$ Myr with peak TDE rates up to $\Gamma\sim5\times10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ per cluster. These IMBHs are natural seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the hierarchical assembly frequently leads to $&gt;2$ SMBH seeds per cluster and their rapid mergers ($t&lt;10$ Myr). We propose that a gravitational wave (GW) driven merger of IMBHs with $1000 M_\odot \lesssim M_\bullet \lesssim 10000 M_\odot$ with comparable masses is a characteristic GW fingerprint of SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z&gt;10$, and IMBH formation in similar environments at lower redshifts. Massive star clusters provide a unique environment for the early Universe GW studies for the next-generation GW observatories including the Einstein Telescope and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics (the BIFROST code) and stellar evolution (the SEVN module) to investigate this collisional assembly. With a full initial stellar mass function, we study the effect of initial binary, triple and massive single stars (450 $M_\odot$) on the assembly, structure, and kinematics of massive ($M_\mathrm {cl}\sim10^6 M_\odot$, $N=1.8 \times 10^6$) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH) mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit increase the numbers (up to $\sim$ 10) and masses (up to $10^4 M_\odot$) of the formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak at $\Gamma_\mathrm {tde}\sim 5 \times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ after IMBH formation at $\sim 2$ Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions approximately as $M_\bullet \propto M_\mathrm{cl}$, $M_\bullet\propto\Sigma_\mathrm{h}^\mathrm{3/2}$ and $M_\bullet\propto\sigma^\mathrm{3}$. Our results suggest the dense $z\sim10$ star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope host IMBHs with masses above $M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: Jellyfish galaxies are extreme examples of how galaxies can transform due to dense environmental effects. These satellite galaxies suffer from ram-pressure stripping, leading to the formation of their distinctive gaseous tails. Some recent observational studies find that jellyfish galaxies are more likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGN) compared to central galaxies of the same mass, suggesting a link between ram pressure and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological-magnetohydrodynamical simulations, namely TNG50 and TNG100, to explore the presence of AGN in jellyfish galaxies with $M_{\rm{stellar}}\simeq10^{9.5-10.8}\,\rm{M}_\odot$ at redshift $z=0$ from the Zooniverse "Cosmological Jellyfish" citizen-science project. Compared to central galaxies, jellyfish are more likely to host an AGN ($L_{\rm AGN}\geq10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) particularly at high stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Jellyfish are also more likely to host an AGN than satellites of the same mass, largely because many satellite galaxies are gas-poor and therefore have lower SMBH accretion rates. Compared to non-jellyfish satellites with similar gas content, jellyfish typically undergo stronger ram pressure and have higher central gas densities along with lower central gas sound speeds, although these effects are smaller at lower stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\lesssim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Together with case studies of individual galaxies, our population analysis indicates that ram pressure can play a key role in fuelling AGN activity in a large fraction of jellyfish, where gas compression can lead to intense episodes of AGN feedback and star formation. Thus, it is essential to consider both environmental and secular processes for a more complete picture of satellite galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Pinched Magnetic Fields in the High-mass Protocluster W3 IRS5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array. The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$. Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing collapse. We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions. The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding \HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.</description>

      <title>Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXIV. 54 New Quasars and Candidate Obscured Quasars at $5.71 \le z \le 7.02$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic identification of 43 quasars and 11 candidate obscured quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR) at $5.71 \le z \le 7.02$, along with 29 galaxies at similar redshifts. This is the 24th publication from the Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, which exploits the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) imaging survey to search for EoR quasars. The HSC-SSP survey has completed, and this paper is likely the final installment of major (unobscured) quasar discoveries from the SHELLQs project. In addition to the EoR objects, we identified five strong [O III] line emitters at $z &lt; 1$, 30 Galactic brown dwarfs, and 14 passive galaxies at $z \sim 2$, which contaminated our sample of photometric quasar candidates. The present paper focuses on describing the immediate outcome of the spectroscopic observations, while a statistical analysis of the full SHELLQs sample will be presented in our next publication.</description>

      <title>An ALMA spectroscopic survey of the Planck high-redshift object PLCK G073.4-57.5 confirms two protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planck's High-Frequency Instrument observed the whole sky between 350um and 3mm, discovering thousands of unresolved peaks in the cosmic infrared background. The nature of these peaks is still poorly understood - while some are strong gravitational lenses, the majority are overdensities of star-forming galaxies but with almost no redshift constraints. PLCK G073.4-57.5 (G073) is one of these Planck-selected peaks. ALMA observations of G073 suggest the presence of two structures between z=1.5 and 2 aligned along the line of sight, but without spectroscopic confirmation. Characterizing the full redshift distribution of the galaxies within G073 is needed in order to better understand this representative example of Planck-selected objects, and connect them to the emergence of galaxy clusters. We used ALMA Band 4 spectral scans to search for CO(3-2), CO(4-3), and CI(1-0) line emission, targeting eight red Herschel-SPIRE sources in the field, as well as four bright SCUBA-2 sources. We find 15 emission lines in 13 galaxies, and using existing photometry, we determined the spectroscopic redshift of all 13 galaxies. Eleven of these galaxies are SPIRE-selected and lie in two structures at &lt;z&gt;=1.53 and &lt;z&gt;=2.31, while the two SCUBA-2-selected galaxies are at z=2.61. Using multi-wavelength photometry we constrained stellar masses and star formation rates, and using the CO and CI emission lines we constrained gas masses. Our protocluster galaxies exhibit typical gas depletion timescales for field galaxies at the same redshifts but higher gas-to-stellar mass ratios, potentially driven by emission line selection effects. The two structures are reproduced in cosmological simulations of star-forming halos at high redshifts; the simulated halos have a 60-70% probability of collapsing into galaxy clusters, implying that the two structures in G073 are genuinely protoclusters.</description>

      <title>Extreme Jet Beaming Observed in Neutrino-Associated Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them over recent years. A particularly strong observational connection is present between neutrinos and blazars with bright, Doppler-boosted, parsec-scale radio emission. In this work, we further explore the nature of this connection by examining the jet geometry and kinematics of neutrino-associated blazars. We find that these blazars demonstrate remarkably strong jet beaming, even compared to other radio-bright sources. Their Doppler and Lorentz factors are larger, and viewing angles are smaller than for other blazars in the complete uniformly selected MOJAVE sample. Observationally, this serves as yet another piece of evidence for blazars forming a major population of neutrino sources. The strong neutrino-beaming correlation indicates that high-energy neutrino velocity is predominantly oriented along the jet, and the original PeV-scale protons exhibit a relativistic bulk motion along the jet. It suggests that neutrino production happens not too close to the black hole, but rather at sub-parsec distances, where the jet is already accelerated.</description>

      <title>GrAviPaSt's Lens to the Past: Unveiling the Evolution of Filamentary Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple, efficient and parameter-free filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.</description>

      <title>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Water Production Rates of the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of water activity in the third confirmed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, based on ultraviolet imaging with the \emph{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory}'s Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT). Assuming a reddening of 29\% between 3325.7~\AA\ and 5437.8~\AA, measurements on 2025 July 31 -- August 1 yielded a first, marginal detection of OH (A$^2\Sigma$ -- X$^2\Pi$) emission near 3085~\AA, corresponding to a water production rate of $(0.74 \pm 0.50) \times 10^{27}$ molecules\,s$^{-1}$. The subsequent visit on 2025 August 18 -- 20 revealed a clear OH detection, implying a higher water production rate of $(1.36 \pm 0.35) \times 10^{27}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ (40 kg~$s^{-1}$) at a heliocentric distance of 2.90~au. This places 3I/ATLAS among the few comets with confirmed OH emission beyond 2.5~au, where water ice sublimation from the nucleus is typically inefficient. The inferred production rate at 2.9 au implies an active area of at least 7.8~km$^2$, assuming equilibrium sublimation. This requires that over 8\% of the surface is active, which is larger than activity levels observed in most solar system comets. Contemporaneous near-infrared spectroscopy indicated the presence of icy grains in the coma, which may serve as an extended source of water vapor.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Hunt for Post-Red Supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud II: Turbulent Line Broadening in the Spectra of LMC Yellow Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive stars in the Hertzsprung gap are a mixed population of objects in short-lived evolutionary phases: yellow supergiants (YSGs) evolving towards the red supergiant (RSG) phase, partially-stripped post-RSGs, and other, rarer outcomes of stellar evolution. Studies of sufficiently large samples of these objects can constrain massive star structure and evolution during these poorly-understood phases. As part of our ongoing program searching for post-RSGs, we characterized the spectral line profiles of 32 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud using high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan 2/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We find that the line profiles are strongly broadened by turbulent photospheric motion. After fitting the profiles to measure microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities, we identify two groups within our sample that are separated by the ratio of the two velocity scales. In both groups, the macroturbulent velocity scales with stellar properties such as effective temperature. Additionally, we find statistically-significant correlations between the macroturbulent velocity and other possible probes of large-scale photospheric motions: line profile asymmetry, as well as the amplitude and quality factor of the stochastic low frequency variability measured from {\it Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite} lightcurves. These correlations differ between the two groups of YSGs. Finally, we construct 1D evolutionary models of YSGs in both pre- and post-RSG phases, and find reasonable agreement between the convective velocities in these models and our measured microturbulent velocities. However, the macroturbulent velocities are much higher than the convective velocities in the models.</description>
