      <title>Mass Transfer in Tidally Heated Stars Orbiting Massive Black Holes and Implications for Repeating Nuclear Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of stars orbiting close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be dramatically modified by tidal heating, which can in principle dissipate an energy much larger than the stellar binding energy. We use analytic models and MESA to explore the coupled dynamics of tidal heating, stellar structural evolution, orbital decay due to gravitational waves and tides, and mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow. In contrast to more equal mass stellar binaries, the stable mass transfer rate for stars orbiting SMBHs is typically set by the tidal heating timescale (the timescale for tides to increase the stellar radius), not by the gravitational wave orbital decay timescale. The resulting stable mass transfer rate is sensitive to the tidal heating model but is plausibly $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-5} M_\odot {\, \rm yr^{-1}}$ (and perhaps larger), sufficient to produce low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in many galaxies. The stability of mass transfer is sensitive to where in the stellar interior the tidal energy is dissipated. MESA models confirm the expected result that mass transfer is unstable (stable) if tidal heating increases (decreases) the fraction of the star that is convective. More detailed conclusions about the stability of mass-transfer will require self-consistently calculating how the tidal heating of stars changes in response to internal structural changes produced by the tidal heating itself. Stars with tidal heating-induced mass transfer can produce a large population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei; they may also be the progenitors of some partial tidal disruption candidates (e.g., ASASSN-14ko) as well as short period quasi-periodic eruptions (e.g., eRO-QPE2 and GSN 069). However, many repeating nuclear transients produced by tidal heating-induced mass loss are likely fainter than those detected thus far, and remain to be discovered.</description>

      <title>The redshift evolution of the luminosity function of type II GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of December 2023, the Swift satellite has detected more than 1600 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
  We select 307 Type II GRBs for constructing the luminosity function (LF) based on the following criteria: (1) duration $T_{90} \geq 2 s$; (2) conformity with the Amati relation for Type II GRBs; and (3) peak flux $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$. We explore two general forms of the GRB LF: a broken power-law (BPL) LF and a triple power-law (TPL) LF. We consider three evolutionary scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. We find that the no evolution model can be excluded, while both luminosity and density evolution models effectively account for the observations. This result is consistent with previous studies on long GRBs (LGRBs). However, our Type II GRB sample favors a BPL LF, in contrast to the preference for a TPL function discovered in Long GRBs.</description>

      <title>X-ray Study on Propagation of Non-thermal Particles in Microquasar SS 433/W 50 Extended Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SS 433, located at the center of the W 50 radio nebula, is a binary system that ejects jets oriented east-west with precessional motion. X-ray lobes, containing compact "knots" labeled as head (e1), lenticular (e2), and ring (e3) in the east, as well as w1, w1.5, and w2 in the west, have been detected along the jets directions. Very-high-energy {\gamma}-ray emission has also been detected from regions containing these X-ray knots, suggesting highly efficient particle acceleration in the jets. In our previous study, we performed X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the western lobe of W 50 to investigate spectral variations. In this work, we extend our study to the eastern region using XMM-Newton observations to provide a more comprehensive picture of the X-ray emission from the SS 433 jets. Our results show no detectable synchrotron emission between SS 433 and the innermost knot (head). We also found that the X-ray spectrum of the eastern jet gradually steepens as one moves away from SS 433. While a similar spectral evolution is observed in the western jet, there are also noticeable differences. In the western lobe, the spectrum initially gradually steepens and then undergoes an abrupt softening outside the knot w2. However, in the eastern jet, no such rapid steepening is observed at the lenticular knot, which corresponds to w2 in the west. Furthermore, the observed brightening and spectral variations in the eastern jet cannot be explained by simply adjusting the parameters of the model used for the western side, suggesting the involvement of additional physical processes such as particle re-acceleration.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Gamma-ray and Neutrino Production Following from the Physics of Photon-Nucleon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical implications of particle photoproduction interactions involving nuclei is considered here, based on the most recent empirical data on particle photoproduction interactions off protons. The implications of photoproduction with helium nuclei are also discussed and compared with gamma-p interactions. It is found that gamma-He interactions, assuming the cosmological abundance of He, produce approximately 10% of the pions as compared with gamma-p interactions. In addition to the production of pions, we also discuss the relative effect of excited nucleon decay leading to single and double pion production, as well as rho, eta, omega and K meson production and decay channels, all of which produce to neutrinos and gamma-rays. The production of mesons other than pions is found not to be significant for producing gamma-rays and neutrinos from astrophysical sources. It is further shown that, for astrophysical gamma-p interactions that lead to gamma-ray and neutrino production, the decay of the Delta(1232) resonance channel clearly dominates, all other production channels being effectively negligible.</description>

      <title>Relativistic regularized kappa distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The special relativistic generalization of isotropic regularized kappa distributions is derived and compared to that of the original Olbertian (or standard) kappa distributions. It is demonstrated that for the latter the kappa parameter is even stronger limited than in the non-relativistic case, while for the former all positive kappa values remain possible. After a derivation of the non-relativistic limits, the pressures of the distributions are studied as a specific case of the moments of both the relativistic standard and regularized kappa distributions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of the optical and UV emission during the 2017 giant outburst of the Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 (Corrigendum)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An error was detected in the code of one of the components considered to model the optical/UV emission of the Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its 2017 giant outburst. This led to an overestimation of the contribution from the X-ray heated surface of the Be star. The addition of the X-ray irradiation of a misaligned Be disk to our model is proposed to explain the observations. Preliminary results of the updated model provide good fit to the data.</description>

      <title>Intriguing nature of AM Her type candidate CXOU J204734.8+300105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of periodic X-ray signals are crucial for identifying new compact objects and studying the mechanisms powering their emission. We report on the timing and spectral variability of CXOU J204734.8+300105, a proposed eclipsing polar-type cataclysmic variable (CV) candidate. This source has been observed once with Chandra and twice with XMM-Newton, revealing several intriguing and conflicting features in its X-ray emission. The Chandra observation showed a periodicity of $\sim$6000 s with an eclipse-like feature. The X-ray light curve from 2017 XMM-Newton observation showed a period of $\sim$2000 seconds without any apparent eclipse, while the simultaneous optical light curve from OM showed a period of $\sim$6000 seconds. This variability raises questions about the true nature of the source. Spectral analysis indicates a multi-component emission and emission lines due to Fe. The spectral characteristics are consistent with those observed in other CV systems. Additionally, we identified optical and near-infrared counterparts from various catalogues. Our findings suggest a dynamic and evolving accretion environment of CXOU J204734.8+300105.</description>

      <title>The systemic recoil velocity distribution and the scale height of isolated millisecond pulsar systems: Implications on neutron star retention fractions in star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systemic recoil velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys}$) distribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is essential for understanding the MSP formation and estimating the retention fractions of MSPs in star clusters, which can potentially be determined with astrometric studies that take into account MSPs' long-term dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled 65 isolated (or field) MSP systems (including lone MSPs) that are well astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar (or space) velocities $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. We find that the observed Galactic-longitude components $v_\mathrm{l}$ of $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions. Assuming that 1) $v_\mathrm{l}$ are statistically stable over time (the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption), and 2) $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ directions are uniformly distributed (the "isotropic-$\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$" assumption), the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian components. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current Galaxy-wide scale heights of isolated MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.66 kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution, $\sim13$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster (GC) with the nominal 50 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of isolated MSP systems may account for the high number of MSPs discovered in GCs, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may follow the same formation channel(s) as isolated MSP systems.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Potential and Density Profile of Secondary Plasma in the Magnetosphere of Orthogonal Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method for determining the accelerating potential above the polar caps of radio pulsars with an arbitrary inclination angle of the magnetic axis to the rotation axis has been proposed. The approach has been based on the concept of a vacuum gap, the height and shape of the upper boundary of which are found self-consistently together with the solution of the corresponding Poisson equation. In turn, information about the accelerating potential has made it possible to determine the transverse profiles of the secondary plasma density. It has also been shown that the effect of inverse Compton scattering on the considered processes is insignificant.</description>

      <title>Polarization Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Simulated Tilted, Truncated Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the Monte-Carlo radiation transport code, \pan, to create images, spectra, polarization maps, and light curves from a set of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted, truncated, black hole accretion disks. Truncation can have spectral and polarization signatures all its own; tilt introduces both inclination and azimuthal dependencies into the spectra and polarization; and precession and oscillations of the tilted accretion flow inside the truncation radius (what we posit to be the "corona") introduce time dependencies or periodicity to all of this. We use the ray-traced results from our simulations to evaluate the feasibility of measuring these effects, particularly in the context of current and future X-ray polarization observatories. Such detections could greatly improve our understanding of the geometry of accretion disks and coronae in the hard state, the physics of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), and how system properties evolve as sources approach the hard-to-soft state transition.</description>

      <title>NVSS J151002+570243: accretion and spin of a z &gt; 4 Fermi detected blazar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei formation and evolution is currently an open puzzle. Their enormous mass is not explainable via sub-Eddington accretion and the frequent presence of relativistic jets at high-z, commonly linked with spinning black holes, suggest a less effective accretion process. NVSS J151002+570243 is part of this population, being the most distant blazar consistently detected by Fermi/LAT, hence hosting a powerful jet. We tested the hypothesis of a super-Eddington accretion process for this source by modeling its big blue bump with a set of accretion disk emission models. We first tested a standard geometrically thin, optically thick $\alpha$-disk, obtaining a mass of Log$M/M_\odot=8.65\pm0.19$ consistent with virial-based results and a significantly sub-Eddington accretion rate $\lambda=0.02\pm0.01$. We then focused on the analytic approximations of two numerical models that take into account the General Relativity effects of a spinning black hole (reasonable due to the presence of a jet) and a close-to- or super-Eddington accretion rate (KERBB and SLIMBH). Despite the focus on super-critical accretion, these models confirm a surprisingly low Eddington ratio, of the order of 3\%. The hypothesis of a continuous accretion at this measured rate is unrealistic, since it would imply a seed black hole mass of $\sim10^6-10^8M_\odot$ at redshift z=20. Hence we explore the possibility of a continuous super-critical accretion starting from a $\sim10^2M_\odot$ seed, that would spin up the black hole and eventually contribute in launching the relativistic jet. The measured low accretion rate would thus happen only once the jet is active. This idea would reconcile the black holes with large masses accreting at somewhat slow rates that are observed at z&gt;4, with the need of an extremely fast evolution, by allowing the formation of stellar-size black hole seeds even as late as at $z\sim8$.</description>

      <title>Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee: Final Report and Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).</description>

      <title>On the effects of radiation on mass transfer in binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer (MT) in binary systems is a common evolutionary process that can significantly affect the structure, evolution, and final fate of both stars. In modeling MT hydrodynamics, it is usually assumed that the critical point of the flow, where the velocity exceeds the local sound speed, coincides with the inner Lagrange point (L1). However, in massive donors, radiative pressure dominates over gas pressure and the Eddington factor $\Gamma_\text{Edd}$ can reach or exceed unity. If there is significant momentum and/or energy exchange between gas and radiation, the critical point of the flow can shift away from L1, affecting the MT rate ($\dot{M}_\text{d}$). Here, we investigate the effects of radiation on MT using time-steady radiative hydrodynamic equations and the assumption of the von Zeipel theorem. We provide analytical expressions that closely approximate $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ and numerical solutions using a realistic equation of state. We find two main differences with respect to the traditional expressions for $\dot{M}_\text{d}$. First, for Roche-lobe-underfilling donors with $\Gamma_\text{Edd} \lesssim 1$, radiative momentum exchange leads to an exponential increase of $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ as a function of $1-\Gamma_\text{Edd}$. We provide a simple modification of existing prescriptions that takes this effect into account. Second, we find that the photon tiring limit for super-Eddington outflows is much less restrictive near L1 than in spherical stars. We suggest that donors with super-Eddington convectively inefficient subsurface layers are able to drive MT with $-\dot{M}_\text{d} \gtrsim 10^{-2}\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ even before overfilling their Roche lobes. We characterize the conditions for this new mode of super-Eddington-boosted MT and discuss the implications for binary evolution including the potential link to nonterminal outbursts of Luminous Blue Variables.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Windows on the Universe: detecting precursor emission to compacts' mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an overview of various mechanisms, and corresponding powers, of precursor emission to compacts' mergers to be detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration. Expected peak powers, $\leq 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, are not sufficiently high to be detected by all-sky high-energy satellites (unless beamed). The best chance is the detection of possible coherent radio emission, producing observable signals up to $\sim$ Jansky of flux density. Low-frequency phased array telescopes like LOFAR, the MWA and DSA-2000 are best suited due to their large instantaneous sky coverage. Time-wise, in addition to LIGO early warning alerts up to a minute before the merger, the dispersive delay at lower frequencies of $\sim$ 300 MHz can be of the order of minutes. Optical detections are the most challenging.</description>

      <title>A proposed deep sea Neutrino Observatory in the Nanhai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past ten years, several breakthroughs have been made in multi-messenger astronomy. Thanks to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the detection of astrophysical neutrinos was proved to be practical. However, due to the limited statistics and field of view, only a few sources have been associated with IceCube neutrinos, making new and larger neutrino telescopes necessary. We propose the NEutrino Observatory in the Nanhai (NEON), located in the South China Sea to be complementary for the global neutrino detectors. This proposal describes the design and layout of the array and reports on comprehensive simulations conducted to assess its performance. The NEON project, with a volume of 10 km$^3$, achieves an angular resolution of 0.1$^\circ$ at 100 TeV. With 10 years of operation, the project's 5$\sigma$ sensitivity is estimated as $E^2\Phi \sim 2 \times 10^{-10}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for a source spectrum index of -2. We found that the variation in depth from 1700 to 3500 meters does not significantly influence the sensitivity to steady sources.</description>

      <title>Multimuons in cosmic-ray events as seen in ALICE at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ALICE is a large experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Located 52 meters underground, its detectors are suitable to measure muons produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere. In this paper, the studies of the cosmic muons registered by ALICE during Run 2 (2015--2018) are described. The analysis is limited to multimuon events defined as events with more than four detected muons ($N_\mu&gt;4$) and in the zenith angle range $0^{\circ}&lt;\theta&lt;50^{\circ}$. The results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations using three of the main hadronic interaction models describing the air shower development in the atmosphere: QGSJET-II-04, EPOS-LHC, and SIBYLL 2.3d. The interval of the primary cosmic-ray energy involved in the measured muon multiplicity distribution is about $ 4 \times 10^{15}&lt;E_\mathrm{prim}&lt; 6 \times 10^{16}$~eV. In this interval none of the three models is able to describe precisely the trend of the composition of cosmic rays as the energy increases. However, QGSJET-II-04 is found to be the only model capable of reproducing reasonably well the muon multiplicity distribution, assuming a heavy composition of the primary cosmic rays over the whole energy range, while SIBYLL 2.3d and EPOS-LHC underpredict the number of muons in a large interval of multiplicity by more than $20\%$ and $30\%$, respectively. The rate of high muon multiplicity events ($N_\mu&gt;100$) obtained with QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL 2.3d is compatible with the data, while EPOS-LHC produces a significantly lower rate ($55\%$ of the measured rate). For both QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL 2.3d, the rate is close to the data when the composition is assumed to be dominated by heavy elements, an outcome compatible with the average energy $E_\mathrm{prim} \sim 10^{17}$ eV of these events. This result places significant constraints on more exotic production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Non-LTE Synthetic Observables of a Multidimensional Model of Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many promising explosion models for the elusive origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ultimately fail to completely reproduce a number of observed properties of these events. One limiting factor for many of these models is the use of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption in the calculation of their synthetic observables, which has been shown to prevent the accurate prediction of a number of fundamental features of SNe Ia. The inclusion of high-accuracy non-LTE physics, however, increases computational cost and complexity such that multidimensional non-LTE calculations are often unfeasible, which can be problematic for models that are inherently multidimensional. In this work, we conduct radiative transfer calculations using 1D profiles that each correspond with a line of sight from an asymmetric, 2D SN Ia model. We find, in LTE, that the synthetic observables from these calculations efficiently reproduce those from the 2D calculation when an equivalence of bolometric luminosities between the 1D and 2D treatments is enforced. This allows for the accurate calculation of synthetic observables in 1D while still preserving multidimensional effects associated with the model. We leverage this to produce high accuracy observables from 1D non-LTE calculations, showing significantly improved agreement with observation, including a roughly 50% reduction of $B$-band decline rate into congruence with the observed Phillips relation. Additionally, our non-LTE observables show Si II $\lambda$5972 pEWs that are much more similar to observation, while spanning multiple Branch classes, suggesting that some spectral classifications of SNe Ia may arise from line of sight effects.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Classics: On the Optical Colours of Novae as Standard Crayons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the $BVRI$ colours of novae over the course of their eruptions. Where possible, interstellar reddening was measured using the equivalent widths of Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs). Some novae lack spectra with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise ratios; therefore, we supplement as necessary with 3D and 2D dust maps. Utilising only novae with DIB- or 3D-map-based $E(B-V)$, we find an average intrinsic $(B-V)_0$ colour of novae at $V$-band light curve peak of 0.20 with a standard deviation of 0.31, based on 25 novae. When the light curve has declined by 2 magnitudes ($t_2$), we find an average $(B-V)_0 = -0.03$ with a standard deviation of 0.19. These average colours are consistent with previous findings, although the spreads are larger than previously found due to more accurate reddening estimates. We also examined the intrinsic $(R-I)_0$ and $(V-R)_0$ colours across our sample. These colours behave similarly to $(B-V)_0$, except that the $(V-R)_0$ colour gets redder after peak, likely due to the contributions of emission line flux. We searched for correlations between nova colours and $t_2$, peak $V$-band absolute magnitude, and GeV $\gamma$-ray luminosity, but find no statistically significant correlations. Nova colours can therefore be used as standard ``crayons" to estimate interstellar reddening from photometry alone, with 0.2--0.3 mag uncertainty. We present a novel Bayesian strategy for estimating distances to Galactic novae based on these $E(B-V)$ measurements, independent of assumptions about luminosity, built using 3D dust maps and a stellar mass model of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Jet-shaped filamentary ejecta in common envelope evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution (CEE) of a neutron star (NS) that launches jets as it spirals in inside the envelope of a rotating red supergiant (RSG) stellar envelope and find that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities form filamentary ejecta. We first study the 3D RSG envelope properties before we launch the jets. Adding envelope rotation causes the RSG envelope to expand in the equatorial plane and contract along the poles, leading to non-radial oscillations that decay after two oscillation periods, like the radial oscillation of the non-rotating model. In addition, the envelope becomes convective with large vortices, as in the non-rotating case. Since RSG stars oscillate and have envelope convection, we strengthen the claim that there is no need to relax one-dimensional stellar models of cool giant stars when transporting them to 3D grids. When adding jets, the 3D simulations that include pre-set envelope rotation show that envelope rotation leads to more prominent spiral structures of the ejecta than in the non-rotating case. We map the envelope zones that are Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and conclude that this instability forms the filamentary ejecta, with and without envelope rotation. The jet-inflated high-pressure volumes around the NS accelerate the envelope, a process prone to Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiative-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright ultraviolet (UV) flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>

      <title>Observational and Theoretical Constraints on First-Order Phase Transitions in Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a fundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase transition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark core, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational and theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger astrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER and spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS modifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>A Stacked Analysis of GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from SPT-SZ Galaxy Clusters with 16 Years of Fermi-LAT Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a statistically significant detection of cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from a stacked sample of SPT-SZ selected galaxy clusters using 16.4 years of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope's Large Area Telescope (LAT). By analyzing a population of clusters with individual Test Statistic (TS) values $&lt;$ 9.0, we identify a robust cumulative signal with a TS of 75.2, which corresponds to approximately $8.4\sigma$ significance. In contrast, clusters with TS $&lt;$ 4.0 yield a weaker cumulative signal of TS equal to 9.65 (2.65$\sigma$), consistent with background fluctuations. The derived $\gamma$-ray spectrum is well characterized by a power law model with a best-fit spectral index of $-2.59 \pm 0.20$ and an integrated flux of $1.67^{+1.35}_{-1.07} \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The high TS values in the full sample are likely driven by AGN-dominated clusters. However, when clusters with TS between 4 and 9 are excluded, the remaining low-TS population shows a stacked signal consistent with hadronic emission.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar Wind nebulae (PWNe), are among the most efficient particle accelerators in the Universe, however understanding the physical conditions and the magnetic geometry in their inner region has always proved elusive. X-ray polarization provides now a unique opportunity to investigate the magnetic field structure and turbulence properties close to where high energy particles are accelerated. Here we report on the recent X-ray polarization measurement of the PWN 3C 58 by the International X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE). 3C 58 is a young system displaying a characteristic jet-torus structure which, unlike other PWNe, is seen almost edge on. This nebula shows a high level of integrated polarization ~ 22% at an angle ~ 97deg, with an implied magnetic field oriented parallel to the major axis of the inner torus, suggesting a toroidal magnetic geometry with little turbulence in the interior, and an intrinsic level of polarization possibly approaching the theoretical limit for synchrotron emission. No significant detection of a polarized signal from the associated pulsar was found. These results confirm that the internal structure of young PWNe is far less turbulent than previously predicted, and at odds with multidimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational wave observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly-explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</description>

      <title>A fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer shapes the properties of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass transfer in binary systems is the key process in the formation of various classes of objects, including merging binary black holes (BBHs) and neutron stars. Orbital evolution during mass transfer depends on how much mass is accreted and how much angular momentum is lost $-$ two of the main uncertainties in binary evolution. Here, we demonstrate that, despite these unknowns, a fundamental limit exists to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer (SMT), that is robust against uncertainties in orbital evolution. Based on detailed evolutionary models of interacting systems with a BH accretor and a massive star companion, we show that the post-interaction orbit is always wider than $\sim10R_{\odot}$, even with extreme shrinkage due to L2 outflows. Systems evolving towards tighter orbits become unstable and result in stellar mergers. This separation limit has direct implications for the properties of BBH mergers: long delay times ($\gtrsim1 \rm Gyr$), and no high BH spins from the tidal spin-up of helium stars. At high metallicity, the SMT channel may be severely quenched due to Wolf-Rayet winds. The reason for the separation limit lies in the stellar structure, not in binary physics. If the orbit gets too narrow during mass transfer, a dynamical instability is triggered by a rapid expansion of the remaining donor envelope due to its near-flat entropy profile. The closest separations can be achieved from core-He burning ($\sim8-15R_{\odot}$) and Main Sequence donors ($\sim15-30R_{\odot}$), while Hertzsprung Gap donors lead to wider orbits ($\gtrsim30-50R_{\odot}$) and non-merging BBHs. These outcomes and mass transfer stability are governed by the internal composition profiles of donor stars. Thus, the formation of compact binaries is a sensitive probe of chemical mixing in stars. We propose a simple treatment of mass transfer stability to reproduce the detailed results.</description>

      <title>$f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nonradial $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars in full general relativity, employing equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model, while assuming isentropy and fixed lepton fractions for the internal structure. The validity of various universal relations for cold neutron stars involving $f$-mode characteristics and macroscopic properties of the star is confirmed for those isentropic protoneutron stars. Prospects of observations are also discussed. According to simulation results, we then model details of the thermal and trapping profiles in a PNS with the canonical mass. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies and gravitational-wave strain amplitudes are presented. The validity of the universal relations during the evolution to the formation of a cold neutron star is confirmed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos carry most of the energy released by a core-collapse supernova. SNOLAB has two neutrino-capable detectors, SNO+ and HALO, that have complementary neutrino flavour sensitivities. SNOLAB is also host to existing facilities, or plans to host future projects, that can enhance sensitivity to these neutrinos. These detectors, together with others worldwide both in existence and planned, will provide insights to a variety of different models using neutrinos from the next galactic supernova.</description>

      <title>Signatures of modified gravity from the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring evidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental dark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting signatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal that, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave function of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy levels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees of freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and Kaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system and eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified gravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future. Numerical estimates for the graviton mass are also provided, and potential imprints on gravitational waves are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Determining the Density of the Sun with Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of solar neutrinos confirmed that the inner workings of the Sun generally match our theoretical understanding of the fusion process. Solar neutrinos have also played a role in discovering that neutrinos have mass and that they oscillate. We combine the latest solar neutrino data along with other oscillation data from reactors to determine the Sun's density profile. We derive constraints given the current data and show the anticipated improvements with more reactor neutrino data from JUNO constraining the true oscillation parameters and more solar neutrino data from DUNE which should provide a crucial measurement of $hep$ neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>The Use of Binary Black Holes Merging in AGN Disks for Hubble Constant Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>
