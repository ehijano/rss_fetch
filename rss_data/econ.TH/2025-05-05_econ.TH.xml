      <title>Impact of random monetary shock: a Keynesian case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the optimal strategy for a firm operating in a dynamic Keynesian market setting. The firm's objective function is optimized using the percent deviations from the symmetric equilibrium of both its own price and the aggregate consumer price index (CPI) as state variables, with the strategy in response to random monetary shocks acting as the control variable. Building on the Calvo framework, we adopt a mean field approach to derive an analytic expression for the firm's optimal strategy. Our theoretical results show that greater volatility leads to a decrease in the optimal strategy. To asses the practical relevance of our model, we apply it to four leading consumer goods firms. Empirical analysis suggests that the observed decline in strategies under uncertainty is significantly steeper than what the model predicts, underscoring the substantial influence of market volatility.</description>

      <title>Optimal Blackjack Betting Strategies Through Dynamic Programming and Expected Utility Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a rigorous mathematical approach to the optimization of round and betting policies in Blackjack, using Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Expected Utility Theory. The analysis considers a direct confrontation between a player and the dealer, simplifying the dynamics of the game. The objective is to develop optimal strategies that maximize expected utility for risk profiles defined by constant (CRRA) and absolute (CARA) aversion utility functions. Dynamic programming algorithms are implemented to estimate optimal gambling and betting policies with different levels of complexity. The evaluation is performed through simulations, analyzing histograms of final returns. The results indicate that the advantage of applying optimized round policies over the "basic strategy" is slight, highlighting the efficiency of the last one. In addition, betting strategies based on the exact composition of the deck slightly outperform the Hi-Lo counting system, showing its effectiveness. The optimized strategies include versions suitable for mental use in physical environments and more complex ones requiring computational processing. Although the computed strategies approximate the theoretical optimal performance, this study is limited to a specific configuration of rules. As a future challenge, it is proposed to explore strategies under other game configurations, considering additional players or deeper penetration of the deck, which could pose new technical challenges.</description>

      <title>The Proportional Veto Principle for Approval Ballots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proportional veto principle, which captures the idea that a candidate vetoed by a large group of voters should not be chosen, has been studied for ranked ballots in single-winner voting. We introduce a version of this principle for approval ballots, which we call flexible-voter representation (FVR). We show that while the approval voting rule and other natural scoring rules provide the optimal FVR guarantee only for some flexibility threshold, there exists a scoring rule that is FVR-optimal for all thresholds simultaneously. We also extend our results to multi-winner voting.</description>

      <title>Optimal classification with outcome performativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider the problem of classifying individual behavior in a simple setting of outcome performativity where the behavior the algorithm seeks to classify is itself dependent on the algorithm. I show in this context that the most accurate classifier is either a threshold or a negative threshold rule. A threshold rule offers the "good" classification to those individuals more likely to have engaged in a desirable behavior, while a negative threshold rule offers the "good" outcome to those less likely to have engaged in the desirable behavior. While seemingly pathological, I show that a negative threshold rule can maximize classification accuracy when outcomes are performative. I provide an example of such a classifier, and extend the analysis to more general algorithm objectives. A key takeaway is that optimal classification can negatively correlate with signal information, yielding adverse downstream effects on individual behavior.</description>
