      <title>Topologically tunable polaritons based on two-dimensional crystals in a photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics is an emergent research discipline which interlinks fundamental aspects of photonics, information processing and solid-state physics. Exciton-polaritons are a specifically interesting platform to study topological phenomena, since the coherent light matter coupling enables new degrees of freedom such as tunable non-linearities, chiralities and dissipation. Room-temperature operation of such exciton-polaritons relies on materials comprising both, large exciton binding energies and oscillator strength. We harness widely spectrally tunable, room temperature exciton-polaritons based on a WS2 monolayer in an open optical cavity to realize a polariton potential landscape which emulates the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian. It comprises a domain boundary hosting a topological, exponentially localized mode at the interface between two lattices characterized by different Zak-phases which features a spectral tunability over a range as large as 80 meV. Moreover, we utilize the unique tilt-tunability of our implementation, to transform the SSH-lattice into a Stark-ladder. This transformation couples the topologically protected defect mode to propagating lattice modes, and effectively changes the symmetry of the system. Furthermore, it allows us to directly quantify the Zak-phase difference $\Delta_{Zak}=(1.13\pm 0.11)\pi$ between the two topological phases. Our work comprises an important step towards in-situ tuning topological lattices to control and guide light on non-linear chips.</description>

      <title>Thermalization dynamics in photonic lattices of different geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical mechanical behavior of weakly nonlinear multimoded optical settings is attracting increased interest during the last few years. The main purpose of this work is to numerically investigate the main factors that affect the thermalization process in photonic lattices. In particular, we find that lattices with identically selected properties (such as temperature, coupling coefficient, lattice size, and excitation conditions) can exhibit very different thermalization dynamics and thus thermalization distances. Our investigation is focused on two different two-dimensional lattices: the honeycomb lattice and the triangular lattice. Our numerical results show that, independently of the excitation conditions, the honeycomb lattice always thermalizes faster than the triangular lattice. We mainly explain this behavior to the quasilinear spectrum that promotes wave-mixing in the honeycomb lattice in comparison to the power-like spectrum of the triangular lattice. In addition, we investigate the combined effects of temperature as well as the sign and magnitude of the nonlinearity. Switching either the sign of the Kerr nonlinear coefficient or the sign of the temperature can lead to significant differences in the thermalization dynamics, a phenomenon that can be physically explained in terms of wave instabilities. Larger absolute values of the temperature |T| result in more uniform distributions for the power occupation numbers and faster thermalization speeds. Finally, as expected, increasing the magnitude of the nonlinearity results in accelerated thermalization. Our findings provide valuable insights into optical thermalization in discrete systems where experimental realization may bring about new possibilities for light manipulation and applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable huge asymmetric transmission in mid-infrared range through a monolayer graphene chiral metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface has witnessed an urgent need for reconfigurable chiral manipulation recently, while the graphene-based devices attracted significant attention from researchers due to their inherent tunable properties. Here, an L-shaped metasurface composed of three hollow monolayer graphene resonant rings is proposed. A huge dual-frequency asymmetric transmission (AT) in the mid-infrared band (7800 nm-9000 nm) with transmission efficiency peaks of 0.14 and 0.26 is revealed, which is optimal of its similar monolayer counterparts in the current band. By changing the Fermi level of graphene and the relaxation time of its carriers, the AT spectrum including the positions and widths of the peaks can be effectively modulated. More importantly, the structure designed here gives priority to the machinability of the metasurface configuration, ensuring its practicality and promising applications in chiral applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Integrated Photonic Receiver for Turbulence Compensation in Free Space Optical Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Free Space Optical (FSO) communication systems, atmospheric turbulence distorts the propagating beams, causing a random fading in the received power. This perturbation can be compensated using a multi-aperture receiver that samples the distorted wavefront on different points and adds the various signals coherently. In this work, we report on an adaptive optical receiver that compensates in real time for scintillation in FSO links. The optical front-end of the receiver is entirely integrated in a silicon photonic chip hosting a 2D Optical Antenna Array and a self-adaptive analog Programmable Optical Processor made of a mesh of tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers. The photonic chip acts as an adaptive interface to couple turbulent FSO beams to single-mode guided optics, enabling energy and cost-effective operation, scalability to systems with a larger number of apertures, modulation-format and data-protocol transparency, and pluggability with commercial fiber optics transceivers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed receiver with optical signals at a data rate of 10 Gbit/s transmitted in indoor FSO links where different turbulent conditions, even stronger than those expected in outdoor links of hundreds of meters, are reproduced.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Recirculating Waveguide Meshes Based on an Optimization Method with a Parameter Space Reduction Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication imperfections must be considered during configuration to ensure that the setup is suitable for the actual fabricated programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs). Therefore, characterization of imperfections is crucial but difficult, especially for PPICs made from recirculating waveguide meshes. The flexibility required by these meshes demands a more complex topology and compact TBU structure, complicating the characterization. In this paper, we propose a characterization method applicable to recirculating waveguide meshes based on an optimization approach, along with a step-by-step procedure to reduce the parameter space of optimization, allowing for characterizing imperfect parameters of each individual component within the waveguide mesh. To the best of our knowledge, this method can greatly broaden the range of characterized parameters compared to currently reported methods. In order to verify the effectiveness of our method, we used the characterized parameters to build a multi-frequency model of a mesh with fabrication errors and successfully demonstrated accurate prediction of its behavior. Furthermore, we applied our method on implementations of 6 different kind of FIR/IRR filters, to further prove the effectiveness of our method in configuring applications on meshes with fabrication errors. At last, our method was carried out under various scenarios considering beam splitter splitting ratio variance, inaccurate measurements of mesh and imprecise TBU insertion loss characterization, to demonstrate its strong robustness under various practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Deep Learning and Phase Change Materials for Four-state Broadband Multifunctional Metasurfaces in the Visible Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we report, for the first time, broadband multifunctional metasurfaces with more than four distinct functionalities. The constituent meta-atoms combine two different phase change materials, $\mathrm{VO_2}$ and $\mathrm{Sb_2S_3}$ in a multi-stage configuration. FDTD simulations demonstrate a broadband reflection amplitude switching between the four states in visible range due to the enhanced cavity length modulation effect from the cascaded Fabry-Perot cavities, overcoming the inherent small optical contrast between the phase change material (PCM) states. This, along with the reflection phase control between the four states, allows us to incorporate both amplitude and phase-dependent properties in the same metasurface - achromatic deflection, wavelength beam splitting, achromatic focusing, and broadband absorption, overcoming the limitations of previous functionality switching mechanisms for the visible band. We have used a Tandem Neural network-based inverse design scheme to ensure the stringent requirements of different states are realized. We have used two forward networks for predicting the reflection amplitude and phase for a meta-atom within the pre-defined design space. The excellent prediction capability of these surrogate models is utilized to train the reverse network. The inverse design network, trained with a labeled data set, is capable of producing the optimized meta-units given the desired figure-of-merits in terms of reflection amplitude and phase for the four states. The optical characteristics of two inverse-designed metasurfaces have been evaluated as test cases for two different sets of design parameters in the four states. Both structures demonstrate the four desired broadband functionalities while closely matching the design requirements, suggesting their potential in visible-range portable medical imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Intracavity Coherent Up-conversion with Giant Nonlinearity in a Polar Fluidic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel microcavity-based photon up-conversion using second harmonic generation (SHG) from a polar nematic fluid media doped with a laser dye. The present idea is based on coherent light generation via simultaneous frequency doubling and stimulated emission (lasing) inside a microcavity. The polar nematic fluid equips very high even-order optical nonlinearity due to the polar symmetry and large dipole moment along the molecular long axis. At the same time, its inherent fluidic nature allows us to easily functionalize the media just by doping, in the present case, with an emissive laser dye. Our demonstrated system exhibits a giant nonlinear optical response to input light, while enabling spectral narrowing and multiple-signal output of up-converted light, that is not attainable though the simple SH-conversion of input light. Furthermore, susceptibility of the liquid crystal offers dynamic modulation capabilities under external stimulus, such as signal switching with electric field application or wavelength tuning through temperature variation. Such a brand-new type of simple coherent flexible up-conversion system must be promising as a new principle for easy-accessible and down-scalable wavelength conversion devices.</description>

      <title>Multichannel sensing platform: galleries of tunable hot spots in ring-disk dielectric dimer with rectangular cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of highly enhanced and localized electromagnetic fields in dielectric structures with low losses, that is, hot spot technology, is an important applied and fundamental problem. However, known examples are reduced to single hot spots generated by low-frequency dipole resonances. Here, a manifold of hot spots were observed experimentally and in calculations in the gap of a ring-inner disk dielectric dimer with a rectangular cross-section. In addition to dipole hot spots, galleries of equidistant hot spots were observed, generated by galleries of disk modes, as well as by galleries of ring modes, each of which begins with a transverse Fabry-P\'erot resonance. Therefore, this direction in photonics is called Fabry-P\'erot-tronics by analogy with Mie-tronics of spherical particles. The intensity contour of hot spots in the gap has a Fano contour associated with the interference of radiation from narrow longitudinal modes of the ring or disk with broadband scattering on the opposite side of the gap. Controlled transfer of hot spots along the gap and splitting of the hot spot by scanning the exciting frequency in the spectral region of the Fano contour are also implemented. Galleries of tunable bright hot spots provide a new platform for multichannel sensing, SERS and nonlinear applications.</description>

      <title>A Variational Approach to Learning Photonic Unitary Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light, light tailored in its internal degrees of freedom, has become topical in numerous quantum and classical information processing protocols. In this work, we harness the high dimensional nature of structured light modulated in the transverse spatial degree of freedom to realise an adaptable scheme for learning unitary operations. Our approach borrows from concepts in variational quantum computing, where a search or optimisation problem is mapped onto the task of finding a minimum ground state energy for a given energy/goal function. We achieve this by a pseudo-random walk procedure over the parameter space of the unitary operation, implemented with optical matrix-vector multiplication enacted on arrays of Gaussian modes by exploiting the partial Fourier transforming capabilities of a cylindrical lens in the transverse degree of freedom for the measurement. We outline the concept theoretically, and experimentally demonstrate that we are able to learn optical unitary matrices for dimensions d = 2, 4, 8 and 16 with average fidelities of &gt;90%. Our work advances high dimensional information processing and can be adapted to both process and quantum state tomography of unknown states and channels.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Bessel Beam Generation Using MetaMaterials in Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bessel beams, known for their unique non-diffracting property, maintain their shape and intensity over long distances, making them invaluable for applications in optical trapping, imaging, and communications. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of micro-photonic antennas designed to generate Bessel beams within the Terahertz (THz) and optical frequency ranges. The technique is demonstrated by generating far-field patterns of Bessel waves at these frequencies. The design employs metasurface patterns arranged as arrays of concentric rings atop rectangular silicon waveguides, collectively creating a Bessel beam. Dyadic Greens function integral equation techniques are used to model the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) fields in the metasurface radiation zone. Utilizing orthogonal vector wave functions, Bloch theorem, Floquet harmonics, and the transverse resonance technique, a photonic chip is designed to achieve a non-diffracting range of 500 um at the optical telecom wavelength of 1.5 um for a metasurface radius of 25 um. A radiation efficiency exceeding 80% is achieved by optimizing the attenuation constant (alpha) along the structure. The theoretical models are validated through simulations for both optical 1.5 um and Terahertz 14 um wavelengths, demonstrating significant alignment between predictions and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Optical signal recording of cellular activity in optogenetic stimulation of human pulp dental cells using a twin-core fiber-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frazao This paper introduces an innovative two-core fiber (TCF) optic sensor employing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) to monitor the optogenetic response of light-sensitive human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). The in-fiber MZI, formed using a segment of TCF optic, detects refractive index (RI) changes in the surrounding medium. The sensor utilizes the evanescent wave of one core as the sensing arm, necessitating a thin cladding achieved through one-sided chemical etching. This design allows the sensor to detect subtle alterations in the RI of the environment by observing displacements in the interference spectrum. The optogenetic stimulation of light-sensitive cells induces variations in ion concentrations, leading to a corresponding change in refractive index. The fabricated sensor, with a peak sensitivity of 675.74 nm/RIU within the RI range of 1.39-1.43, can detect these changes. A computer simulation validated the sensitivity and optimized fabrication parameters, exhibiting satisfactory agreement with experimental results. Spectrum displacements were recorded for both light-sensitive hDPSCs and regular hDPSCs (as a control test). Results from the experiment, analyzed and compared using data analysis software, revealed that 473 nm blue light effectively stimulated light-sensitive hDPSCs. Notably, the proposed sensor, a novel structure, demonstrated its capability to detect RI changes in the cell medium during optogenetic applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid terahertz emitter for pulse shaping and chirality control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation, spanning from 0.3 to 3x10^12 Hz, fills the crucial gap between the microwave and infrared spectral range. THz technology has found applications in various fields, from imaging and sensing to telecommunication and biosensing. However, the full potential of these applications is often hindered by the need for precise control and manipulation of the frequency and polarization state, which typically requires external THz modulators. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid THz source that overcomes this limitation. Our device consists of two THz emitters integrated into one single device, enabling pulse shaping and chirality control of the emitted radiation without additional external components. The two sources are a spintronic emitter and a semiconductor photoconductive antenna (PCA). Using a combination of dual-wavelength excitation, allowing for control of the relative time delay between the two laser excitation pulses, and tuning external parameters for each emitter (i.e., biasing voltage for the PCA and magnetic field for the spintronic THz emitter) enables precise control of the mixing of the two signals and results in frequency, polarization, and chirality control of the overall THz radiation. This on-chip hybrid emitter provides an essential platform for engineered THz radiation with wide-ranging potential applications.</description>

Abstract: Hopfions, higher-dimensional topological quasiparticles with sophisticated 3D knotted spin textures discovered in condensed matter and photonic systems, show promise in high-density data storage and transfer. Here we present crystalline structures of hopfions lying in space-time constructed by spatiotemporally structured light. A practical methodology using bichromatic structured light beams or dipole arrays to assemble 1D and higher dimensional hopfion lattices is proposed and a technique for tailoring topological orders is elucidated. The birth of photonic hopfion crystals heralds a new era in high-dimensional, condensed, and robust topological information processing.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous optical singularities and duality-protected dark directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves are described by not only polarization ellipses but also cyclically rotating vectors tracing out them. The corresponding fields are respectively directionless steady line fields and directional instantaneous vector fields. Here we study the seminal topic of electromagnetic scattering from the perspective of instantaneous vector fields and uncover how the global topology of the momentum sphere regulates local distributions of tangent scattered fields. Structurally-stable generic singularities of vector fields move cyclically along lines of linear polarizations and at any instant their index sum has to be the Euler characteristic $\chi=2$. This contrasts sharply with steady line fields, of which generic singularities constrained by the Euler characteristic locate on points of circular polarizations. From such unique perspective of instantaneous singularities, we discovered that for circularly-polarized waves scattered by electromagnetic duality-symmetric particles, since linearly-polarized scatterings are prohibited by helicity conservation, there must exist at least one dark direction along which the scattering is strictly zero. Two such dark directions can be tuned to overlap, along which the scattering would remain zero for arbitrary incident polarizations. We have essentially revealed that \textit{polarizations underdescribe vectorial electromagnetic waves and the instantaneous perspective is indispensable}. The complementarity we discover provides broader and deeper insights into not only electromagnetism, but also other branches of wave physics where singularities are generic and ubiquitous.</description>

Abstract: Precisely stabilizing laser frequency is crucial for advancing laser technology and unlocking the full potential of various quantum technologies. Here, we propose a compact device for stabilizing frequency of a semiconductor laser through mode coupling effects, which provides enhanced sensitivity. Our proposed architecture features a main ridge waveguide with a Bragg grating, flanked by two curved ridge waveguides. This configuration exhibits an optical phenomenon characterized by a transmission crossing at the wavelength of the Bragg grating. Using particle swarm optimization strategy and employing efficient figures of merit, we achieve a high transmission crossing. The observed asymmetric transmission crossing not only holds the promise for an efficient and compact on-chip laser frequency stabilizer, but also fosters the development of novel sensing platforms with heightened sensitivity.</description>

      <title>System- and Sample-agnostic Isotropic 3D Microscopy by Weakly Physics-informed, Domain-shift-resistant Axial Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) subcellular imaging is essential for biomedical research, but the diffraction limit of optical microscopy compromises axial resolution, hindering accurate 3D structural analysis. This challenge is particularly pronounced in label-free imaging of thick, heterogeneous tissues, where assumptions about data distribution (e.g. sparsity, label-specific distribution, and lateral-axial similarity) and system priors (e.g. independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise and linear shift-invariant (LSI) point-spread functions (PSFs)) are often invalid. Here, we introduce SSAI-3D, a weakly physics-informed, domain-shift-resistant framework for robust isotropic 3D imaging. SSAI-3D enables robust axial deblurring by generating a PSF-flexible, noise-resilient, sample-informed training dataset and sparsely fine-tuning a large pre-trained blind deblurring network. SSAI-3D was applied to label-free nonlinear imaging of living organoids, freshly excised human endometrium tissue, and mouse whisker pads, and further validated in publicly available ground-truth-paired experimental datasets of 3D heterogeneous biological tissues with unknown blurring and noise across different microscopy systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study a double-slit interferometer that detects the modification of local phase and amplitude signal due to a refractive index contrast in a nanoplasmonic sensor after the plasmonic wave has been coupled to the farfield. Specifically, the sensor consists of two elongated zero-mode waveguides (ZMW) which function to launch surface plasmons as well as transmit light directly into the farfield. The surface plasmon waves are coupled to the farfield by surface gratings which cover one quarter of a bull-eye antenna, with different transmission directions. In the farfield, the coupled plasmon waves interfere with the directly transmitted reference wave, which reveals a combination of the phase and amplitude modification by the asymmetry of refractive index in the lumen of the ZMW. We report a drastic increase in sensitivity over interferometers that only utilize the directly transmitted fraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the new concept of photonic alloy as a non-periodic topological material. By mixing non-magnetized and magnetized rods in a non-periodic 2D photonic crystal configuration, we realized photonic alloys in the microwave regime. Our experimental findings reveal that the photonic alloy sustains non-reciprocal chiral edge states (CESs) even at very low concentration of magnetized rods. The non-trivial topology and the associated edge states of these non-periodic systems can be characterized by the winding of the reflection phase. Our results indicate that the threshold concentrations for the investigated system within the first non-trivial band gap to exhibit topological behavior approach zero in the thermodynamic limit for substitutional alloys, while the threshold remains non-zero for interstitial alloys. At low concentration, the system exhibits an inhomogeneous structure characterized by isolated patches of non-percolating magnetic domains that are spaced far apart within a topologically trivial photonic crystal. Surprisingly, the system manifests CESs despite a local breakdown of time-reversal symmetry rather than a global one. Photonic alloys represent a new category of disordered topological materials, offering exciting opportunities for exploring topological materials with adjustable gaps.</description>

Abstract: Optical beam propagation in random media is characterized by familiar speckle patterns generated by intricate interference effects. Such patterns may be modified and possibly attenuated for partially coherent incident beam profiles. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave propagation, we show how the spatio-temporal statistics of the partially coherent beams interact with the statistics of the random medium to enhance or suppress scintillation effects.</description>

      <title>Purely Quantum Nonreciprocity by Spatially Separated Transmission Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal photon blockade is of particular interest due to its potential applications in chiral quantum technologies and topological photonics. In the regular cases, nonreciprocal transmission (classical nonreciprocity) and nonreciprocal photon blockade (quantum nonreciprocity) often appear simultaneously. Nevertheless, how to achieve purely quantum nonreciprocity (no classical nonreciprocity) remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a spatially separated transmission scheme, that the photons transport in different directions take different paths, in an optical system consisting of two spinning cavities coupled indirectly by two common drop-filter waveguides. Based on the spatially separated transmission scheme, we demonstrate a purely quantum nonreciprocity (nonreciprocal photon blockade) by considering the Kerr nonlinear interaction in one of the paths. Interestingly, we find that the nonreciprocal photon blockade is enhanced nonreciprocally, i.e., the nonreciprocal photon blockade is enhanced when the photons transport in one direction but suppressed in the reverse direction. We identify that the nonreciprocal enhancement of nonreciprocal photon blockade is induced by the destructive or constructive interference between two paths for two photons passing through the whole system. The spatially separated transmission scheme proposed in the work provides a novel approach to observe purely quantum nonreciprocal effects.</description>

      <title>Two stage decoherence of optical phonons in long oligomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intramolecular energy transport is generally responsible for chemical energy balance in molecular systems. The transport is fast and efficient if energy is transferred by optical phonons in periodic oligomers, but its efficiently is limited by decoherence emerging due to anharmonic interactions with acoustic phonons. We show that in the most common case of the optical phonon band being narrower than the acoustic bands decoherence takes place in two stages. The faster stage involves optical phonon multiple forward scattering due to absorption and emission of transverse acoustic phonons, i. e. collective bending modes with a quadratic spectrum; the transport remains ballistic and the speed can be altered. The subsequent slower stage involves phonon backscattering in multiphonon processes involving two or more acostic phonons resulting is a switch to diffusive transport. If the initially excited optical phonon possesses a relatively small group velocity, then its equilibration in the first stage is accompanied by its acceleration due to its transitions to states propagating faster. This theoretical expectation is consistent with the recent measurements of optical phonon transport in alkane chains, accelerating with increasing the chain length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum interference phenomenon in which four-photon quantum states generated by two independent sources are used to create a two-photon interference pattern without detecting two of the photons. Contrary to the common perception, the interference pattern can be made fully independent of phases acquired by the photons detected to construct it. However, it still contains information about spatially dependent phases acquired by the two undetected photons. This phenomenon can also be observed with fermionic particles. We show that the phenomenon can be applied to develop an interferometric, quantum phase imaging technique that is immune to uncontrollable phase fluctuations in the interferometer and allows image acquisition without detecting the photons illuminating the object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated materials may exhibit unusually high resistivity increasing linearly in temperature, breaking through the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound, above which coherent quasiparticles are destroyed. The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies suggest plasmons are overdamped while others detect unrenormalized plasmons. Here, we present direct optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl2. HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl2. Many-body theory supported by photoemission results reveals that MoOCl2 is in an orbital-selective and highly incoherent Peierls phase. Different orbitals acquire markedly different bonding-antibonding character, producing a highly-anisotropic, isolated Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is further reconstructed and made partly incoherent by electronic interactions, renormalizing the plasma frequency. HPPs remain long-lived in spite of this, allowing us to uncover previously unseen imprints of electronic correlations on plasmonic collective modes.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the near-field radiative heat transfer between a normally and/or laterally shifted nanoparticle and a planar fused silica slab coated with a strip graphene grating. For this study we develop and use a scattering matrix approach derived from Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions. We find that adding a graphene sheet coating on the slab can already enhance the heat flux by about 85%. We show that by patterning the graphene sheet coating into a grating, the heat flux is further increased, and this happens thanks to the a topological transition of the plasmonic modes from circular to hyperbolic one, which allows for more energy transfer. The lateral shift affects the accessible range of high-$k$ modes and thus affects the heat flux, too. By moving the nanoparticle laterally above the graphene grating, we can obtain an optimal heat flux with strong chemical potential dependance above the strips. For a fixed graphene grating period ($D=1\mu$m) and not too large normal shift (separation $d&lt;800$nm), two different types of lateral shift effects (e.g., enhancement and inhibition) on heat transfer have been observed. As the separation $d$ is further increased, the lateral shift effect becomes less important. We show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$. Two distinct asymptotic regimes are proposed: (1) the inhibition regime ($d/D&lt;0.85$), where the lateral shift reduces the heat transfer, and (2) the neutral regime ($d/D \geq 0.85$) where the effect of the lateral shift is negligible. In general, we can say that the geometric factor $d/D \approx 0.85$ is a critical point for the lateral shift effect. Our predictions can have relevant implications to the radiative heat transfer and energy management at the nano/micro scale.</description>

      <title>Propagation in rough waveguides: Forward and inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss here the direct and inverse problems for wave propagation in a waveguide with rough internal surface and arbitrary mean shape. The high degree of multiple scattering inside the waveguide poses significant challenges both for the forward computation and for the recovery of the surface profile, and raises important questions about scattering cross-sections. This paper falls into two parts corresponding to these issues.
  We first apply Left-Right (L-R) operator splitting to calculate the scattered fields in 2- and 3-dimensional waveguides. Using this we illustrate the scattered fields and the effect of surface roughness. In the second part we formulate an algorithm for surface recovery from field measurements along the waveguide axis, which generalises recent work on surfaces in 2 dimensions. This method utilizes forward scattering assumptions in effect by formulating an integral equation in the unknown surface field, treated as a function of the surface. Although discussed in the context of waveguides, the formulae are given in a form applicable to a variety of geometries, with coefficients which will depend on and be determined by each specific application.</description>

      <title>Background resilient quantitative phase microscopy using entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a quantum-based quantitative phase microscopy technique using a phase gradient approach that is inherently background resistant and does not rely on interferometry or scanning. Here, a transparent sample is illuminated by both photons of a position-momentum entangled pair with one photon setup for position measurement in the near-field (NF) of the sample and its partner for momentum measurement in the far-field (FF). By virtue of the spatial correlation property inherent to the entanglement, both the position and momentum information of the photons can thus be obtained simultaneously. The phase profile of the sample is then deduced through a phase gradient measurement obtained by measuring the centroid shift of the photons' in the FF momentum plane for each NF position. We show that the technique, while achieving an imaging resolution of 2.76\,$\mu$m, is phase accurate to at least $\lambda/30$ and phase sensitive to $\lambda/100$ at a wavelength of 810\,nm. In addition, through the temporal correlation between the photon pairs, our technique shows resilience to strong dynamic background lights, which can prove difficult to account for in classical phase imaging techniques. We believe this work marks a significant advancement in the capabilities of quantum phase microscopy and quantum imaging in general, it showcases imaging and phase resolutions approaching those attainable with classical phase microscopes. This advancement brings quantum imaging closer to practical real-world applications, heralding new possibilities in the field.</description>

Abstract: We report on attosecond-scale control of high-harmonic and electron emission from plasma mirrors driven by relativistic-intensity near-single-cycle lightwaves at kHz repetition rate. By controlling the waveform of the intense light transient, we reproducibly form a sub-cycle temporal intensity gate at the plasma mirror surface, leading to the observation of extreme ultraviolet spectral continua, characteristic of isolated attosecond pulse generation. We also observe the correlated emission of a waveform-dependent relativistic electron beam, paving the way towards fully lightwave-controlled dynamics of relativistic plasma mirrors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its widespread significance, the temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) lacks a foundational validation based on electromagnetic principles and stands as a phenomenological theory relying on fitted coupling coefficients. We employ an ab initio Maxwellian approach using quasinormal-mode theory to derive an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation for resonator dynamics. While the resulting differential equation bears resemblance to the classical one, it introduces novel terms embodying distinct physics, suggesting that the CMT predictions could be faulted by dedicated experiments, for instance carried out with short and off-resonance pulses, or with resonators of sizes comparable to or greater than the wavelength. Nonetheless, our examination indicates that, despite its inherent lack of strictness, the CMT enables precise predictions for numerous experiments due to the flexibility provided by the fitted coupling coefficients. The new EME equation is anticipated to be applicable to all electromagnetic resonator geometries, and the theoretical approach we have taken can be extended to other wave physics.</description>

Abstract: Photonics offers unique capabilities for quantum information processing (QIP) such as room-temperature operation, the scalability of nanophotonics, and access to ultrabroad bandwidths and consequently ultrafast operation. Ultrashort-pulse sources of quantum states in nanophotonics are an important building block for achieving scalable ultrafast QIP, however, their demonstrations so far have been sparse. Here, we demonstrate a femtosecond biphoton source in dispersion-engineered periodically poled lithium niobate nanophotonics. We measure 17 THz of bandwidth for the source centered at 2.09 \textmu m, corresponding to a few optical cycles, with a brightness of 8.8 GHz/mW. Our results open new paths towards realization of ultrafast nanophotonic QIP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging has shown promising applications in imaging occluded objects around corners. However, this inverse problem is highly ill-posed and results in poor reconstruction with traditional physical retrieval methods, particularly in moving target imaging. With the development of neural networks, data-driven methods have greatly improved accuracy, however, heavy reliance on data volume has put great pressure on data collection and dataset fabrication. We propose a physical embedded passive NLOS imaging prototype with event-based vision (EPNP), which induces an event camera for feature extraction of dynamic diffusion spot and leverages simulation dataset to pre-train the physical embedded model before fine-tuning with limited real-shot data. The proposed PNPE is verified by simulation and real-world experiments, and the comparisons of data paradigms also validate the superiority of event-based vision in passive NLOS imaging for moving targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper discusses certain special Gaussian beams that, thanks to some polynomial prefactors, have uniquely designed holes in the irradiance. Such holes, or rather tubes, can constitute potential valleys for negatively polarizable particles, providing the possibility of guiding several objects of that kind, each along its own trajectory. The mechanism of creating these holes by interference of Gaussian beams which exhibit orbital angular momentum is discussed, and then the trajectories of particles moving in such a wave are numerically calculated. As it turns out, these particles, performing transverse oscillations, follow the designed tunnels of low irradiance. On the contrary, for particles with positive polarizability these areas are inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces for infrared multi-modal microscopy: phase contrast and bright field</title>

Abstract: Different imaging modalities are used to extract the diverse information carried in an optical field. Two prominent modalities include bright field and phase contrast microscopy that can visualize the amplitude and phase features of a sample, respectively. However, capturing both of these images on the same camera typically requires interchanging optical components. Metasurfaces are ultra-thin nanostructures that can merge both of these operations into a single miniaturized device. Here, a silicon-based metasurface that supports a Mie resonance is demonstrated to perform near-infrared phase contrast and bright field multi-modal microscopy that can be tuned by changing the polarization of the illumination. We performed experiments using optical fields with phase variations synthesized by a spatial light modulator and introduced by propagation through semi-transparent samples, including C. elegans, unstained human prostate cancer cells and breast tissue. The results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces for label-free point-of-care testing.</description>

      <title>Diamond-lattice photonic crystals assembled from DNA origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal self-assembly allows rational design of structures on the micrometer and submicrometer scale. One architecture that can generate complete 3D photonic band gaps is the diamond cubic lattice, which has remained difficult to realize at length scales comparable to the wavelength of visible or ultraviolet light. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional photonic crystals self-assembled from DNA origami that act as precisely programmable patchy colloids. Our DNA-based nanoscale tetrapods crystallize into a rod-connected diamond cubic lattice with a periodicity of 170 nm. This structure serves as a scaffold for atomic layer deposition of high refractive index materials such as TiO$_2$, yielding a tunable photonic band gap in the near-ultraviolet.</description>
