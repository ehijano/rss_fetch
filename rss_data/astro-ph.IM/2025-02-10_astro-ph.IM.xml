      <title>An Alternate Method for Minimizing $\chi^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe an algorithm and associated software package (sfit_minimize) for maximizing the likelihood function of a set of parameters by minimizing $\chi^2$. The key element of this method is that the algorithm estimates the second derivative of the $\chi^2$ function using first derivatives of the function to be fitted. These same derivatives can also be used to calculate the uncertainties in each parameter. We test this algorithm against several standard minimization algorithms in SciPy.optimize.minimize() by fitting point lens models to light curves from the 2018 Korea Microlensing Telescope Network event database. We show that for fitting microlensing events, SFit works faster than the Nelder-Mead simplex method and is more reliable than the BFGS gradient method; we also find that the Newton-CG method is not effective for fitting microlensing events.</description>

      <title>The Numerics of VMEC++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/PARVMEC) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.</description>

      <title>Planet Masses, Radii, and Orbits from NASA's K2 Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the masses, sizes, and orbital properties of 86 planets orbiting 55 stars observed by NASA's K2 Mission with follow-up Doppler measurements by the HIRES spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory. Eighty-one of the planets were discovered from their transits in the K2 photometry, while five were found based on subsequent Doppler measurements of transiting planet host stars. The sizes of the transiting planets range from Earth-size to larger than Jupiter (1-3 REarth is typical), while the orbital periods range from less than a day to a few months. For 32 of the planets, the Doppler signal was detected with significance greater than 5-sigma (51 were detected with &gt;3-sigma significance). An important characteristic of this catalog is the use of uniform analysis procedures to determine stellar and planetary properties. This includes the transit search and fitting procedures applied to the K2 photometry, the Doppler fitting techniques applied to the radial velocities, and the spectral modeling to determine bulk stellar parameters. Such a uniform treatment will make the catalog useful for statistical studies of the masses, densities, and system architectures of exoplanetary systems. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished RVs and associated stellar activity indicators obtained by our team for these systems, along with derived stellar and planet parameters.</description>

      <title>Debris disks around M dwarfs: The Herschel DEBRIS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Herschel open-time key program Disc Emission via a Bias-free Reconnaissance in the Infrared and Sub-millimeter (DEBRIS) is an unbiased survey of the nearest ~100 stars for each stellar type A-M observed with a uniform photometric sensitivity to search for cold debris disks around them. The analysis of the Photoconductor Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) photometric observations of the 94 DEBRIS M dwarfs of this program is presented in this paper, following upon two companion papers on the DEBRIS A-star and FGK-star subsamples. In the M-dwarf subsample, two debris disks have been detected, around the M3V dwarf GJ581 and the M4V dwarf FomalhautC (LP876-10). This result gives a disk detection rate of 2.1^{+2.7}_{-0.7}% at the 68% confidence level, significantly less than measured for earlier stellar types in the DEBRIS program. However, we show that the survey of the DEBRIS M-dwarf subsample is about ten times shallower than the surveys of the DEBRIS FGK subsamples when studied in the physical parameter space of the disk's fractional dust luminosity versus blackbody radius. Furthermore, had the DEBRIS K-star subsample been observed at the same shallower depth in this parameter space, its measured disk detection rate would have been statistically consistent with the one found for the M-dwarf subsample. Hence, the incidence of debris disks does not appear to drop from the K subsample to the M subsample of the DEBRIS program, when considering disks in the same region of physical parameter space. An alternative explanation is that the only two bright disks discovered in the M-dwarf subsample would not, in fact, be statistically representative of the whole population.</description>

      <title>Tracking electron capture processes in classical molecular dynamics simulations for spectral line broadening in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for diagnosing laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark-broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as invaluable tools, offering \textit{idealized experiments} with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z &gt;= 1. Importantly, the procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. As a result, our simulations naturally and accurately incorporate the effects of both strong collisions and electron capture phenomena on spectral line broadening.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting generic fast-time features in the neutrino lightcurve of nearby supernovae in neutrino telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino emission offers a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport processes within a supernova. Fast-time variations in the neutrino luminosity and mean energy can provide insights into phenomena like turbulence, convection, and shock revival. In this paper, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the planned IceCube-Gen2 detector in identifying generic fast-time features in the neutrino light curve. We also investigate the potential enhancement in detection sensitivity using wavelength shifters, which can improve light collection efficiency. By employing a Short-Time Fourier Transform analysis, we quantify the excess power in the frequency spectrum arising from fast-time modulations and compute the detection horizon for a range of generic models. We find that with IceCube we can already see the strongest modulation models (&gt;50% amplitude) for progenitors located anywhere in the Milky Way. Sensitivity to weaker modulations (&gt;20% amplitude) is possible in future detectors like IceCube-Gen2, in particular with the use of wavelength shifters. For all detector configurations, the frequency and central time of the fast-time feature at the 5$\sigma$ detection horizon can be measured with a resolution of 7.0 Hz and 17 ms respectively.</description>
