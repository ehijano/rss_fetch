      <title>Practical Implementation of an End-to-End Methodology for SPC of 3-D Part Geometry: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Del Castillo and Zhao (2020, 2021, 2022, 2024) have recently proposed a new methodology for the Statistical Process Control (SPC) of discrete parts whose 3-dimensional (3D) geometrical data are acquired with non-contact sensors. The approach is based on monitoring the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator of each scanned part estimated using finite element methods (FEM). The spectrum of the LB operator is an intrinsic summary of the geometry of a part, independent of the ambient space. Hence, registration of scanned parts is unnecessary when comparing them. The primary goal of this case study paper is to demonstrate the practical implementation of the spectral SPC methodology through multiple examples using real scanned parts acquired with an industrial-grade laser scanner, including 3D printed parts and commercial parts. We discuss the scanned mesh preprocessing needed in practice, including the type of remeshing found to be most beneficial for the FEM computations. For each part type, both the "phase I" and "phase II" stages of the spectral SPC methodology are showcased. In addition, we provide a new principled method to determine the number of eigenvalues of the LB operator to consider for efficient SPC of a given part geometry, and present an improved algorithm to automatically define a region of interest, particularly useful for large meshes. Computer codes that implement every method discussed in this paper, as well as all scanned part datasets used in the case studies, are made available and explained in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>Fairness is in the details : Face Dataset Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditing involves verifying the proper implementation of a given policy. As such, auditing is essential for ensuring compliance with the principles of fairness, equity, and transparency mandated by the European Union's AI Act. Moreover, biases present during the training phase of a learning system can persist in the modeling process and result in discrimination against certain subgroups of individuals when the model is deployed in production. Assessing bias in image datasets is a particularly complex task, as it first requires a feature extraction step, then to consider the extraction's quality in the statistical tests. This paper proposes a robust methodology for auditing image datasets based on so-called "sensitive" features, such as gender, age, and ethnicity. The proposed methodology consists of both a feature extraction phase and a statistical analysis phase. The first phase introduces a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically designed for extracting sensitive features with a limited number of manual annotations. The second phase compares the distributions of sensitive features across subgroups using a novel statistical test that accounts for the imprecision of the feature extraction model. Our pipeline constitutes a comprehensive and fully automated methodology for dataset auditing. We illustrate our approach using two manually annotated datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Practice of Deep Hierarchical Ensemble Network for Ad Conversion Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictions of click through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) play a crucial role in the success of ad-recommendation systems. A Deep Hierarchical Ensemble Network (DHEN) has been proposed to integrate multiple feature crossing modules and has achieved great success in CTR prediction. However, its performance for CVR prediction is unclear in the conversion ads setting, where an ad bids for the probability of a user's off-site actions on a third party website or app, including purchase, add to cart, sign up, etc. A few challenges in DHEN: 1) What feature-crossing modules (MLP, DCN, Transformer, to name a few) should be included in DHEN? 2) How deep and wide should DHEN be to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and efficacy? 3) What hyper-parameters to choose in each feature-crossing module? Orthogonal to the model architecture, the input personalization features also significantly impact model performance with a high degree of freedom. In this paper, we attack this problem and present our contributions biased to the applied data science side, including:
  First, we propose a multitask learning framework with DHEN as the single backbone model architecture to predict all CVR tasks, with a detailed study on how to make DHEN work effectively in practice; Second, we build both on-site real-time user behavior sequences and off-site conversion event sequences for CVR prediction purposes, and conduct ablation study on its importance; Last but not least, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary loss to predict future actions in the input sequence, to help resolve the label sparseness issue in CVR prediction.
  Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous single feature crossing modules with pre-trained user personalization features.</description>

      <title>Covariance meta regression, with application to mixtures of chemical exposures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motivation of this article is to improve inferences on the covariation in environmental exposures, motivated by data from a study of Toddlers Exposure to SVOCs in Indoor Environments (TESIE). The challenge is that the sample size is limited, so empirical covariance provides a poor estimate. In related applications, Bayesian factor models have been popular; these approaches express the covariance as low rank plus diagonal and can infer the number of factors adaptively. However, they have the disadvantage of shrinking towards a diagonal covariance, often under estimating important covariation patterns in the data. Alternatively, the dimensionality problem is addressed by collapsing the detailed exposure data within chemical classes, potentially obscuring important information. We apply a covariance meta regression extension of Bayesian factor analysis, which improves performance by including information from features summarizing properties of the different exposures. This approach enables shrinkage to more flexible covariance structures, reducing the over-shrinkage problem, as we illustrate in the TESIE data using various chemical features as meta covariates.</description>

      <title>Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter for trajectory measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for multi-target filtering based on sensor measurements that are sets of trajectories in the last two-time step window. The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Loss Reserving and Risk Capital Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance industry, reserves comprise most of a company's liabilities. These reserves are the best estimates made by actuaries for future unpaid claims. Notably, reserves for different lines of business (LOBs) are related due to dependent events or claims. While the actuarial industry has developed both parametric and non-parametric methods for loss reserving, only a few tools have been developed to capture dependence between loss reserves. This paper introduces the use of the Deep Triangle (DT), a recurrent neural network, for multivariate loss reserving, incorporating an asymmetric loss function to combine incremental paid losses of multiple LOBs. The input and output to the DT are the vectors of sequences of incremental paid losses that account for the pairwise and time dependence between and within LOBs. In addition, we extend generative adversarial networks (GANs) by transforming the two loss triangles into a tabular format and generating synthetic loss triangles to obtain the predictive distribution for reserves. We call the combination of DT for multivariate loss reserving and GAN for risk capital analysis the extended Deep Triangle (EDT). To illustrate EDT, we apply and calibrate these methods using data from multiple companies from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners database. For validation, we compare EDT to the copula regression models and find that the EDT outperforms the copula regression models in predicting total loss reserve. Furthermore, with the obtained predictive distribution for reserves, we show that risk capitals calculated from EDT are smaller than that of the copula regression models, suggesting a more considerable diversification benefit. Finally, these findings are also confirmed in a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Validation of satellite and reanalysis rainfall products against rain gauge observations in Ghana and Zambia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14829v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate rainfall data are crucial for effective climate services, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture depends heavily on rain-fed systems. The sparse distribution of rain-gauge networks necessitates reliance on satellite and reanalysis rainfall products (REs). This study evaluated eight REs -- CHIRPS, TAMSAT, CHIRP, ENACTS, ERA5, AgERA5, PERSIANN-CDR, and PERSIANN-CCS-CDR -- in Zambia and Ghana using a point-to-pixel validation approach. The analysis covered spatial consistency, annual rainfall summaries, seasonal patterns, and rainfall intensity detection across 38 ground stations. Results showed no single product performed optimally across all contexts, highlighting the need for application-specific recommendations. All products exhibited a high probability of detection (POD) for dry days in Zambia and northern Ghana (70% &lt; POD &lt; 100%, and 60% &lt; POD &lt; 85%, respectively), suggesting their utility for drought-related studies. However, all products showed limited skill in detecting heavy and violent rains (POD close to 0%), making them unsuitable for analyzing such events (e.g., floods) in their current form. Products integrated with station data (ENACTS, CHIRPS, and TAMSAT) outperformed others in many contexts, emphasizing the importance of local observation calibration. Bias correction is strongly recommended due to varying bias levels across rainfall summaries. A critical area for improvement is the detection of heavy and violent rains, with which REs currently struggle. Future research should focus on this aspect.</description>

      <title>Estimated Roadway Segment Traffic Data by Vehicle Class for the United States: A Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Highway Performance Monitoring System, managed by the Federal Highway Administration, provides essential data on average annual daily traffic across U.S. roadways, but it has limited representation of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles on non-interstate roads. This gap limits research and policy analysis on the impacts of truck traffic, especially concerning air quality and public health. To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of truck traffic on vulnerable communities exposed to air pollution.</description>

      <title>Penalized Linear Models for Highly Correlated High-Dimensional Immunophenotyping Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and identification of variables associated with outcomes or disease states are critical for advancing diagnosis, prognosis, and precision medicine in biomedical research. Regularized regression techniques, such as lasso, are widely employed to enhance interpretability by reducing model complexity and identifying significant variables. However, when applying to biomedical datasets, e.g., immunophenotyping dataset, there are two major challenges that may lead to unsatisfactory results using these methods: 1) high correlation between predictors, which leads to the exclusion of important variables with included predictors in variable selection, and 2) the presence of skewness, which violates key statistical assumptions of these methods. Current approaches that fail to address these issues simultaneously may lead to biased interpretations and unreliable coefficient estimates. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel two-step approach, the Bootstrap-Enhanced Regularization Method (BERM). BERM outperforms existing two-step approaches and demonstrates consistent performance in terms of variable selection and estimation accuracy across simulated sparsity scenarios. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of BERM by applying it to a human immunophenotyping dataset identifying important immune parameters associated the autoimmune disease, type 1 diabetes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models describe the evolution of a communicable disease over time. These models are often modified to include the effects of interventions (control measures) such as vaccination, social distancing, school closings etc. Many such models were proposed during the COVID-19 epidemic. Inevitably these models are used to answer the question: What is the effect of the intervention on the epidemic? These models can either be interpreted as data generating models describing observed random variables or as causal models for counterfactual random variables. These two interpretations are often conflated in the literature. We discuss the difference between these two types of models, and then we discuss how to estimate the parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>From Winter Storm Thermodynamics to Wind Gust Extremes: Discovering Interpretable Equations from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably identifying and understanding temporal precursors to extreme wind gusts is crucial for early warning and mitigation. This study proposes a simple data-driven approach to extract key predictors from a dataset of historical extreme European winter windstorms and derive simple equations linking these precursors to extreme gusts over land. A major challenge is the limited training data for extreme events, increasing the risk of model overfitting. Testing various mitigation strategies, we find that combining dimensionality reduction, careful cross-validation, feature selection, and a nonlinear transformation of maximum wind gusts informed by Generalized Extreme Value distributions successfully reduces overfitting. These measures yield interpretable equations that generalize across regions while maintaining satisfactory predictive skill. The discovered equations reveal the association between a steady drying low-troposphere before landfall and wind gust intensity in Northwestern Europe.</description>
