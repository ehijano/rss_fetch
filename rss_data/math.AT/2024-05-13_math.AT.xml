      <title>Spaces of non-resultant systems of real bounded multiplicity determined by a toric variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any field $\Bbb F$ and positive integers $m,n,d$ with $(m,n)\not= (1,1)$, Farb and Wolfson defined the certain affine varieties ${\rm Poly}^{d,m}_n(\Bbb F)$ as generalizations of spaces first studied by Arnold, Vassiliev, Segal and others. As a natural generalization of this, for each fan $\Sigma$ and $r$-tuple $D=(d_1,\cdots ,d_r)$ of positive integers, the current authors defined spaces ${\rm Poly}^{D,\Sigma}_n(\Bbb F)$, where $r$ is the number of one dimensional cones in $\Sigma$. These spaces can also be regarded as generalizations of the space ${\rm Hol}^*_D(S^2,X_\Sigma)$ of based rational curves from the Riemann sphere $S^2$ to the toric variety $X_\Sigma$ of degree $D$, where $X_\Sigma$ denotes the toric variety (over $\Bbb C$) corresponding to the fan $\Sigma$. In this paper, we define spaces ${\rm Q}^{D,\Sigma}_n(\Bbb F)$ ($\Bbb F=\Bbb R$ or $\Bbb C$) which are real analogues of ${\rm Poly}^{D,\Sigma}_n(\Bbb F)$ and which can be viewed as a generalizations of spaces considered by Arnold, Vassiliev and others in the context of real singularity theory. We prove that homotopy stability holds for these spaces and compute the stability dimensions explicitly.</description>

      <title>A simple model for twisted arrow $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,1)$-categories were introduced by Lurie, and they have various applications in higher category theory. Abell\'{a}n Garc\'{i}a and Stern gave a generalization to twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,2)$-categories. In this paper we introduce another simple model for twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,2)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for general linear groups over Dedekind domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new kind of homological stability theorem for automorphism groups of finitely-generated projective modules over Dedekind domains, which takes into account all possible stabilisation maps between these, rather than only stabilisation by the free module of rank 1. We show the same kind of stability holds for Clausen and Jansen's reductive Borel--Serre spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a number field with ring of integers $\mathfrak{O}$ and let $\mathcal{G}$ be a Chevalley group scheme not of type $\mathtt{E}_8$, $\mathtt{F}_4$ or $\mathtt{G}_2$. We use the theory of Tits buildings and a result of T\'oth on Steinberg modules to prove that $H^{\operatorname{vcd}}(\mathcal{G}(\mathfrak{O}); \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ if $\mathfrak{O}$ is Euclidean.</description>

      <title>On representation categories of $A_\infty$-algebras and $A_\infty$-coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02707v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the language of monads, comonads and Eilenberg-Moore categories to describe a categorical framework for $A_\infty$-algebras and $A_\infty$-coalgebras, as well as $A_\infty$-modules and $A_\infty$-comodules over them respectively. The resulting formalism leads us to investigate relations between representation categories of $A_\infty$-algebras and $A_\infty$-coalgebras. In particular, we relate $A_\infty$-comodules and $A_\infty$-modules by considering a rational pairing between an $A_\infty$-coalgebra $C$ and an $A_\infty$-algebra $A$. The categorical framework also motivates us to introduce $A_\infty$-contramodules over an $A_\infty$-coalgebra $C$.</description>

      <title>On Good $2$-Query Locally Testable Codes from Sheaves on High Dimensional Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expose a strong connection between good $2$-query locally testable codes (LTCs) and high dimensional expanders. Here, an LTC is called good if it has constant rate and linear distance. Our emphasis in this work is on LTCs testable with only $2$ queries, which are of particular interest to theoretical computer science. This is done by introducing a new object called a sheaf that is put on top of a high dimensional expander. Sheaves are vastly studied in topology. Here, we introduce sheaves on simplicial complexes. Moreover, we define a notion of an expanding sheaf that has not been studied before.
  We present a framework to get good infinite families of $2$-query LTCs from expanding sheaves on high dimensional expanders, utilizing towers of coverings of these high dimensional expanders. Starting with a high dimensional expander and an expanding sheaf, our framework produces an infinite family of codes admitting a $2$-query tester. We show that if the initial sheaved high dimensional expander satisfies some conditions, which can be checked in constant time, then these codes form a family of good $2$-query LTCs.
  We give candidates for sheaved high dimensional expanders which can be fed into our framework, in the form of an iterative process which conjecturally produces such candidates given a high dimensional expander and a special auxiliary sheaf. (We could not verify the prerequisites of our framework for these candidates directly because of computational limitations.) We analyse this process experimentally and heuristically, and identify some properties of the fundamental group of the high dimensional expander at hand which are sufficient (but not necessary) to get the desired sheaf, and consequently an infinite family of good $2$-query LTCs.</description>

      <title>$\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence via representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a purely derivator theoretical reformulation and proof of a classic result of Happel and Ladkani, showing that it occurs uniformly across stable derivators and it is then independent of coefficients. The resulting equivalence provides a bridge between homotopy theory and representation theory: indeed, we explain how our result is a derivator-theoretic version of the $\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence for bounded cochain complexes. Moreover, our equivalence can also be realised as an action of a spectral bimodule in the setting of universal tilting theory developed by Groth and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'i\v{c}ek.</description>

      <title>Isotropic and numerical equivalence for Chow groups and Morava K-theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the conjecture claiming that, over a flexible field, isotropic Chow groups coincide with numerical Chow groups (with ${\Bbb{F}}_p$-coefficients). This shows that Isotropic Chow motives coincide with Numerical Chow motives. In particular, homs between such objects are finite groups and $\otimes$ has no zero-divisors. It provides a large supply of new points for the Balmer spectrum of the Voevodsky motivic category. We also prove the Morava K-theory version of the above result, which permits to construct plenty of new points for the Balmer spectrum of the Morel-Voevodsky ${\Bbb{A}}^1$-stable homotopic category. This substantially improves our understanding of the mentioned spectra whose description is a major open problem.</description>

      <title>A rank decomposition for the topological classification of neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks can be thought of as applying a transformation to an input dataset. The way in which they change the topology of such a dataset often holds practical significance for many tasks, particularly those demanding non-homeomorphic mappings for optimal solutions, such as classification problems. In this work, we leverage the fact that neural networks are equivalent to continuous piecewise-affine maps, whose rank can be used to pinpoint regions in the input space that undergo non-homeomorphic transformations, leading to alterations in the topological structure of the input dataset. Our approach enables us to make use of the relative homology sequence, with which one can study the homology groups of the quotient of a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and a subset $A$, assuming some minimal properties on these spaces.
  As a proof of principle, we empirically investigate the presence of low-rank (topology-changing) affine maps as a function of network width and mean weight. We show that in randomly initialized narrow networks, there will be regions in which the (co)homology groups of a data manifold can change. As the width increases, the homology groups of the input manifold become more likely to be preserved. We end this part of our work by constructing highly non-random wide networks that do not have this property and relating this non-random regime to Dale's principle, which is a defining characteristic of biological neural networks.
  Finally, we study simple feedforward networks trained on MNIST, as well as on toy classification and regression tasks, and show that networks manipulate the topology of data differently depending on the continuity of the task they are trained on.</description>
