      <title>Landau Polarons as Generators of Quantum-Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Landau's theory, polarons have been understood as quasiparticles in which charges are dressed by the lattice field, yet decades of transport and spectroscopic studies have yielded only static indirect renormalizations. Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time, revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Neon Thin Film Growth with an NbTiN Superconducting Resonator Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators. By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$ across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12 K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>The spinterface mechanism for the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect: A Critical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, whereby chiral molecules preferentially transmit electrons of one spin orientation, remains one of the most intriguing and debated phenomena at the interface of spintronics, molecular electronics, and quantum materials. Despite extensive experimental observations across diverse platforms - including transport junctions, photoemission, and enantioselective chemistry - a comprehensive theoretical framework is still lacking. In this perspective, we critically examine the spinterface mechanism as a unifying explanation for the CISS effect. The spinterface model, which hypothesizes a feedback interaction between electron motion in chiral molecules and fluctuating surface magnetic moments, is shown to quantitatively reproduce experimental data across various systems and conditions. We contrast it with some existing theoretical models, highlighting key experimental features. Importantly, we also address open questions and criticisms of this model, including the nature of surface magnetism, the role of dissipation, and the applicability of the mechanism to non-helical or electrode-free systems. By offering falsifiable predictions and reconciling theory with experimental raw data, this work aims to sharpen the dialogue surrounding the microscopic origin of CISS and stimulate further experimental and theoretical progress.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional moir\'e engineering in zigzag graphene nanoribbons on hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e system composed of a zigzag graphene nanoribbon (GNR) placed on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Using an effective grid model derived from continuum elasticity theory, we calculate the relaxed atomic structure of the GNR/hBN system for various twist angles and ribbon widths. The relaxation gives rise to a characteristic 1D domain structure consisting of alternating commensurate AB$'$ regions and two distinct types of domain boundaries. At finite twist angles, the ribbon adopts a wavy shape, locally tracing the hBN zigzag direction but occasionally sliding to adjacent atomic rows. The resulting moir\'e potential strongly modulates the electronic structure: the zero-energy zigzag edge states are modulated by the local stacking, leading to densely packed subbands in the AB$'$ domains and sharply localized domain-wall states in the energy gaps between domain plateaus, which together realize gate-tunable one-dimensional arrays of quantum-confined electronic states. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e modulation in GNR/hBN heterostructures provides a versatile platform for electronic structure engineering and the design of 1D moir\'e nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Versatile tunable optical injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions in a magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise probe and control of various quantum degrees of freedom in novel quantum matter are central to understanding fundamental quantum physics and hold promise for innovative routes to encode and process information. Chirality is one such degree of freedom that has recently attracted intense research interest, especially for Weyl fermions in topological Weyl semimetals. The coupling of chiral degrees of freedom through light-matter interactions and the versatile control of these couplings through external fields can lead to precise quantum control of Weyl fermions. In this work, we demonstrate the observation of light chirality-dependent photocurrent in the mid-infrared regime. Excitation wavelength-dependent measurements reveal that the photocurrent originates from the injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions by chiral polarized mid-infrared photons. The optical process that generates unbalanced chiral polarized Weyl fermions is determined to be a third-order nonlinear photocurrent process. Compared with nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals, such coupling is versatilely tunable in magnetic Weyl semimetals with the magnetization direction and external electric field in addition to the chirality of light. Our results are not only directly applicable to tunable circular-polarization-sensitive photodetection in the mid-infrared regime, but also pave the way toward functional quantum devices that utilize the chiral quantum degrees of freedom of Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Optimal spin-charge interconversion in graphene through spin-pseudospin entanglement control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical generation of spin signals is of central interest for spintronics, where graphene stands as a relevant platform as its spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is tuned by proximity effects. Here, we propose an enhancement of spin-charge interconversion in graphene by controlling the intraparticle entanglement between the spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that, although the spin alone is not conserved in Rashba-Dirac systems, a combined spin-pseudospin operator is conserved. This conserved quantity represents the interconversion between pure spin and pseudospin textures to a spin-pseudospin entangled structure, where Kane-Mele SOC tunes this balance. By these means, we achieve spin-charge interconversion of 100\% efficiency via the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Quantum transport simulations in disordered micron-size systems demonstrate the robustness of this effect, and also reveal a disorder resilient spin Hall effect generated by the interplay between Rashba and Kane-Mele SOC. Our findings propose a platform for maximally efficient spin-charge interconversion, and establish spin-pseudospin correlations as a mechanism to tailor spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic Rashba contribution to the spin-Hall effect in external electric and magnetic fields in Al and Pt was investigated. Schemes of edge accumulation of spins are proposed that take into account the flip of spins when they do not coincide with the direction of the magnetic field. Based on the obtained experimental data on the spin-Hall effect, an assessment of the spin-orbit interaction in the studied paramagnets was made.</description>

      <title>Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers host maze-like stripe domains that transform into a disordered bubble/skyrmion lattice under out-of-plane magnetic fields at ambient temperature. Femtosecond magneto-optics distinguishes these textures via their distinct coherent breathing dynamics. Crucially, applying a brief in-plane ``set'' magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations reveal that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. Thus, modifying the initial domain configuration by in-plane fields enables precise control of coherent magnetization dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond timescales and potentially even of topology.</description>

      <title>Universal Thickness-Dependent Absorption in Solids at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through systematic experimental and theoretical studies of layer-thickness-dependent absorption in semiconducting MoSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ across the visible to near-infrared spectral range, we demonstrate a universal absorption behavior in solids at nanoscale thicknesses. With increasing thickness, a non-monotonic evolution of absorption integrated over the measured spectral region is revealed which is accompanied by pronounced oscillatory features. This strongly deviates from the expected Beer-Lambert law. The observed behavior has origins in the electromagnetic interference effects taking place between the two surfaces of the thin crystals. The present work on 2D semiconductors is extendable to all kinds of solids such as conventional semiconductors (e.g. Si, GaAs, GaN, InP), (semi)metals (e.g. Al, Ag, Au, c-HOPG) and 2D magnetic materials (e.g. CrSBr and NiPS$_3$). Our results provide fundamental insights into light-matter interactions in solids at the nanoscale and are vital for optimally designing the new generation of absorption-based flexible optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin filtering on demand via localized states in an atomic-scale resonant tunneling magnetic tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin filtering and its back-action spin transfer torque (STT) are key ingredients of latest spintronic devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Resonant tunneling (RT), implemented by design or occurring as parasitic effects, is known to crucially affect macroscopic device performance, but direct experimental access to its individual microscopic processes has remained difficult. Here we apply the RT scheme from MTJs to spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) for ultimate miniaturization obtained by addressing distinct sites on individual nanomagnets. Combined with energy selectivity, our experimental model set-up enables to study the spin filtering capabilities of RT through an individual spin-split vacuum resonance state and of the corresponding STT exerted on the nanomagnet. We find, that the sign and magnitude of the STT follow the effective spin-polarization of the resonance state, which, as we show, can by tailored on demand either by adjusting the applied bias or the current injection point on the nanostructure. We anticipate, that our atomic-scale RT-MTJ approach and the discovery of a versatile tunable spin-filter at smallest scale will prove invaluable for studying and designing next generation MTJs potentially based on recently discovered 2D van-der-Waals magnets or altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Exciton-based sensing of remote electron correlations in 2D heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, are direct bandgap two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with sharp optical resonances at excitonic bound state frequencies. Recent experiments have demonstrated that excitonic resonance frequencies in multilayer van der Waals stacks are altered by long-range Coulomb interactions with electrons in nearby but electrically isolated 2D materials. These modulations have been successfully used to detect transitions between distinct states of remote strongly correlated 2D electron fluids. In this Letter we provide a theory of these frequency shifts, enabling a more quantitative interpretation of excitonic-sensing experiments, and apply it as an example to WSe$_2$ that is proximate to graphene bilayers and multilayers.</description>

      <title>Berry Curvature Dipole-induced Non-linear Hall Effect in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of non-linear Hall effects in time-reversal invariant systems has established the intriguing role of band topology beyond Berry curvature in determining transport phenomena. Many of these non-linear responses owe their origin to the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), which, like the Berry curvature (monopole), is also an electronic band structure effect, but is routinely strongly constrained by crystalline symmetries. Here, we propose non-centrosymmetric transition metal oxide heterostructures as promising platforms for realizing and tuning BCD-induced non-linear Hall effects. Specifically, we investigate superlattices of the form $(\mathrm{Ba(Os,Ir)}\mathrm{O}_3)_n/(\mathrm{BaTiO}_3)_4$ ($n{=}1, 2$), comprising metallic perovskite layers ($\mathrm{BaOsO_3}$ or $\mathrm{BaIrO_3}$) sandwiched between insulating ferroelectric $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ (BTO). The ferroelectric distortion in BTO breaks inversion symmetry of the superlattice, giving rise to a finite BCD with two symmetry-allowed components of equal magnitude and opposite sign. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the magnitude of the BCD -- and consequently the nonlinear Hall response -- can be effectively tuned by varying the number of metallic layers or the choice of the B-site cation in these $\mathrm{ABO_3}$ perovskites. Since Rashba splitting and ferroelectric distortion in these systems are readily controllable via an external electric field or strain, the non-linear Hall response in these materials can be directly engineered. Our findings establish non-centrosymmetric oxide perovskite heterostructures as a versatile platform for exploring and manipulating BCD-driven non-linear transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exciton and biexciton preparation via coherent swing-up excitation in a GaAs quantum dot embedded in micropillar cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation conditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and two-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\sim$95 %) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a shortened exciton decay time ($\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient exciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both excitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in a highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized exciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and biexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of biexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report that, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton state without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications.</description>

Abstract: Imaging spatial mode profiles is important for understanding the behavior of mechanical resonators. The recent development of phononic circuits has increased the demand for a fast imaging method based on principles of coherent detection. However, it becomes complicated to perform measurements on a large surface area. Here, we present a frequency-detuned collimated-beam interferometry measurement scheme with in-plane spatial resolution of about 6 um, which can provide information about the phase dynamics of the entire mechanical oscillation cycle on a time scale of a few seconds. We employ a stroboscopic pulse probing method to resolve high-frequency vibrational motion with a standard CMOS camera. We use this setup to image megahertz frequency resonant mode profiles present in a Valley-Hall topological triangular cavity, over an area of more than 20 mm2. We relate the obtained data to numerical simulations of the topological edge modes to reveal the relation between backscattering and the mode profile distribution. The presented protocol can become a staple for characterizing mesoscopic mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Markov Inequality as a Tool for Linear-Scaling Estimation of Local Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a linear-scaling stochastic method to compute real-space maps of any positive local spectral operator in a tight-binding model. By employing positive-definite estimators, the sampling error at each site can be rigorously bounded relative to the mean via the Markov inequality, overcoming the lack of self-averaging and enabling accurate estimates even under strong spatial fluctuations. The approach extends to non-diagonal observables, such as local currents, through local unitary transformations and its effectiveness is showcased by benchmark calculations in the disordered two-dimensional (2D) $\pi$-flux model, where the LDoS and steady-state current maps are computed. This method will enable simulations of disorder-driven mesoscopic phenomena in realistically large lattices and accelerate real-space self-consistent mean-field calculations.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Planar Hall effect in nanostructures of trigonal-PtBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.</description>

      <title>Cooper pair condensation from entanglement-entropy collapse of many-body states in sheared bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moir\'e supercell. In this regime, we show by means of a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation that the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. We adopt an exact diagonalization approach, on top of the Hartree-Fock approximation, to show how the condensation of Cooper pairs takes place in the strong-coupling limit of a valley-polarized flat band. A key factor of our proposal is the existence of zero entanglement-entropy many-body states, just made of a single Slater determinant, which are immune to the hybridization with the rest of the states under the strong Coulomb interaction. Moreover, we show that single-particle states with reverse sign of valley symmetry breaking have complementary charge distributions in the supercell, leading to a ground state where the Coulomb repulsion is minimized by placing electrons with opposite spin in different valleys. We argue that the collapse of the entanglement entropy causes the formation of many-body ground states with Cooper pairs made of electrons and their respective partners under valley symmetry, unveiling a strong-coupling mechanism of condensation in a flat band with initially no Fermi line.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic resonance in a single-photon emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which fluctuations enhance an otherwise weak signal. It has been found in many different systems in paleoclimatology, biology, medicine, and physics. The classical stochastic resonance due to thermal noise has recently been experimentally extended to the quantum regime, where the fundamental randomness of individual quantum events provides the noise source. Here, we demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance in the single-electron tunneling dynamics of a periodically driven single-photon emitter, consisting of a self-assembled quantum dot that is tunnel-coupled to an electron reservoir. Such highly-controllable quantum emitters are promising candidates for future applications in quantum information technologies. We monitor the charge dynamics by resonant optical excitation and identify quantum stochastic resonance with the help of full counting statistics of tunneling events in terms of the Fano factor and extend the statistical evaluation to factorial cumulants to gain a deeper understanding of this far-reaching phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Measuring the measurement problem: controlling decoherence with measurement duration in molecular MCB junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the measurement duration on quantum coherence in molecular mechanically controlled break junctions operating in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) partially wet phase. These systems represent a distinct class of enclosed open quantum systems with unusually long decoherence times at ambient conditions, on the order of 1-20 ms. By tuning the integration time of the current measurement in current-voltage (IV) characteristics, relative to the decoherence time, we observe a transition from quantum interference patterns, manifested as structured bands of data points, to classical behavior characterized by a single averaged response. This demonstrates that the duration of a measurement acts as a controllable parameter for probing quantum behavior in molecular junctions, offering new insights into decoherence dynamics in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced nematic and stripe orders within the charge density wave state of TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theory to address conflicting experimental claims regarding the charge density wave (CDW) state in TiSe$_2$, including whether there is a single or multiple CDW transitions and whether threefold rotation symmetry ($C_3$) is broken. Using a continuum $\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$ model coupled to the CDW order parameter, we show how commonplace conduction band doping induces a nematic transition from a $C_3$-symmetric $3Q$ CDW to a $C_3$-breaking $3Q$ CDW, which is favored by the large ellipticity of the conduction bands of TiSe$_2$. We also find that a $1Q$ stripe CDW is generically stabilized for sufficiently high electron doping. We then show how both stripe and nematic CDW states emerge self-consistently from a minimal interacting tight-binding model, for both positive and negative initial gaps. Our theory provides a new scenario in which, as temperature is lowered, a second $C_3$-breaking transition may occur or not depending on the doping level, potentially explaining the experimental variability. These predictions can be further verified with a variety of probes including transport, photoemission and tunneling.</description>

      <title>Developments in the applications of density functional theory to fractional quantum Hall systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect remains a captivating area in condensed matter physics, characterized by strongly correlated topological order, which manifests as fractionalized excitations and anyonic statistics. Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion theory. This paper systematically evaluates how density functional theory approaches have addressed fundamental challenges in fractional quantum Hall systems, including ground state and low-energy excitations. Special attention is given to the insights provided by density functional theory regarding composite fermion behavior, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. The discussion critically examines both the advantages and limitations of these approaches, while highlighting the productive interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models. Future directions are explored, particularly the promising potential of time-dependent density functional theory for modeling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Transport Signatures of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in a Weyl Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions in solids are often accompanied by structural changes, but subtle lattice distortions can remain hidden from conventional crystallographic probes, hindering the identification of the correct order parameters. A case in point is Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a correlated polar ruthenate with well-characterized phase transitions, whose ground state structure has recently become a subject of debate. This uncertainty stems from extremely small atomic displacements ($\sim$0.001 \AA) between competing phases, beyond the resolution of X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, or optical second-harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a method to detect hidden symmetry breaking by leveraging nonlinear transport induced by quantum geometry. We show that Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a Weyl chain semimetal in both phases. The low-symmetry phase, classified as an altermagnet by symmetry, features distorted topological surface states that are asymmetric along the polar ($b$) axis. However, the nonrelativistic spin splitting is too weak ($\sim$0.1 meV) to be resolved directly, regarding the altermagnetism. In contrast, Weyl chains generate a large quantum metric at the Fermi surface, leading to nonlinear conductivities that are orders of magnitude stronger in the low-symmetry phase. A longitudinal nonlinear conductivity along the polar axis emerges exclusively in this phase, providing a sensitive probe to qualitatively distinguish it from the high-symmetry structure and demonstrate the emergence of altermangetism, which is confirmed by a recent experiment. Our work establishes a route for identifying hidden symmetry breaking in complex quantum materials through the interplay of crystal symmetry, topology and nonlinear quantum transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in non-Hermitian systems that encompasses both biorthogonal and self-norm non-biorthogonal formulations for pure and mixed states under quantum quench protocols. Our framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs in the two-band model: orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly, we demonstrate that non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological characteristics of DQPTs, unveiling their fundamental features beyond conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with implications for quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</description>
