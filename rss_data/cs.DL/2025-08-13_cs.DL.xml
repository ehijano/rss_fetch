      <title>Exploring the Technical Knowledge Interaction of Global Digital Humanities: Three-decade Evidence from Bibliometric-based perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computational methods with humanities scholarship to investigate innovative topics. Each academic discipline follows a unique developmental path shaped by the topics researchers investigate and the methods they employ. With the help of bibliometric analysis, most of previous studies have examined DH across multiple dimensions such as research hotspots, co-author networks, and institutional rankings. However, these studies have often been limited in their ability to provide deep insights into the current state of technological advancements and topic development in DH. As a result, their conclusions tend to remain superficial or lack interpretability in understanding how methods and topics interrelate in the field. To address this gap, this study introduced a new concept of Topic-Method Composition (TMC), which refers to a hybrid knowledge structure generated by the co-occurrence of specific research topics and the corresponding method. Especially by analyzing the interaction between TMCs, we can see more clearly the intersection and integration of digital technology and humanistic subjects in DH. Moreover, this study developed a TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis to analyze the development characteristics and patterns of research disciplines. By applying this workflow to large-scale bibliometric data, it enables a detailed view of the knowledge structures, providing a tool adaptable to other fields.</description>

      <title>APCs and citation impact of Gold OA articles authored by Ukrainian scholars before and during Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine (2020-2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine affected APCs, publishing patterns, and citation impact of Gold OA articles authored by Ukrainian scholars between 2020 and 2023. Data from Scopus covers articles published before (2020-2021) and after (2022-2023) the war's onset. Statistical analysis revealed a small but significant correlation between APC amounts and citation impact, though the effect size was minimal, suggesting higher APCs did not substantially boost citations. APC waivers offered by major publishers such as Springer and Elsevier since 2022 have led to only a slight increase in articles authored solely by Ukrainian scholars in their journals. Despite these waivers, MDPI and Aluna Publishing House maintained the largest shares of such publications, likely due to low rejection rates, fast publication, and - in Aluna's case - reduced APCs for Ukrainian authors. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of articles authored solely by Ukrainian scholars in foreign journals fell by 25.7%, and total APC spending declined by 24.6%, from EUR 1.24 million to EUR 0.93 million. Medicine accounted for the largest share of both articles and APC expenditure, with the majority published in Aluna journals. Ensuring genuine equity in scholarly communication requires alternative publishing models beyond APC-based Gold OA, guaranteeing equal opportunities to publish regardless of institutional or national affiliation. Reform must also address evaluation systems that prioritise output metrics over research quality and academic cultures that favour speed and APC payments over rigour, even when high-quality, no-cost publishing options are available.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances and Trends in Research Paper Recommender Systems: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the volume of scientific publications grows exponentially, researchers increasingly face difficulties in locating relevant literature. Research Paper Recommender Systems have become vital tools to mitigate this information overload by delivering personalized suggestions. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of Research Paper Recommender Systems developed between November 2021 and December 2024, building upon prior reviews in the field. It presents an extensive overview of the techniques and approaches employed, the datasets utilized, the evaluation metrics and procedures applied, and the status of both enduring and emerging challenges observed during the research. Unlike prior surveys, this survey goes beyond merely cataloguing techniques and models, providing a thorough examination of how these methods are implemented across different stages of the recommendation process. By furnishing a detailed and structured reference, this work aims to function as a consultative resource for the research community, supporting informed decision-making and guiding future investigations in the advances of effective Research Paper Recommender Systems.</description>

      <title>The shape of economics before and after the financial crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the global financial crisis on the shape of economics as a discipline by analyzing EconLit-indexed journals from 2006 to 2020 using a multilayer network approach. We consider two types of social relationships among journals, based on shared editors (interlocking editorship) and shared authors (interlocking authorship), as well as two forms of intellectual proximity, derived from bibliographic coupling and textual similarity. These four dimensions are integrated using Similarity Network Fusion to produce a unified similarity network from which journal communities are identified. Comparing the field in 2006, 2012, and 2019 reveals a high degree of structural continuity. Our findings suggest that, despite changes in research topics after the crisis, fundamental social and intellectual relationships among journals have remained remarkably stable. Editorial networks, in particular, continue to shape hierarchies and legitimize knowledge production.</description>

      <title>Situated Epistemic Infrastructures: A Diagnostic Framework for Post-Coherence Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance, knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.</description>
