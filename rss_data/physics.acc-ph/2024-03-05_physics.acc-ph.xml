      <title>Quench Performance of the First Pre-series AUP Cryo-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN will include eight cryo-assemblies that are expected to be fabricated and delivered to CERN by the US HL-LHC Accelerator Upgrade Project (AUP) as part of the U.S. contributions to the HL-LHC. These cryostat assemblies are the quadrupole magnetic components of the HL-LHC Q1 and Q3 inner triplet optical elements in front of the two interaction points. Each cryo-assembly consists of two 4.2 m long Nb3Sn quadrupole magnets with aperture 150 mm and operating gradient 132.6 T/m. The first pre-series cryo-assembly has been fabricated and successfully tested at the horizontal test facility at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. In this manuscript we report the quench test results of the LQXFA/B-01 cryo-assembly. The primary objective of the horizontal test is full cryo-assembly qualification and validation of the performance requirements.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal beam dynamics design fpr Super Tau-Charm Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The project of Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) proposed in China, as a new-generation high-luminosity $e^+e^-$ collider in the low-energy region with the center-of-mass energy of 2-7 GeV, is well underway. The luminosity is targeted at $1.0\times10^{35} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ at the optimized beam energy of 2 GeV. Longitudinal beam dynamics becomes of great importance for the STCF due to the constraints from the novel beam-beam effect called coherent X-Z instability and severe beam collective effects. In this paper, we will develop an iterative optimization model for the STCF longitudinal beam dynamics design, which takes into account the influence of transverse dynamics, coherent X-Z instability, and collective effects.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of dark current from an S-band rf gun with exchangeable photocathode system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field emission or dark current from RF electron guns is problematic for accelerators for several reasons, and can be more difficult to predict, measure and understand, compared to the main beam. The work presented here is a study of the dark current emitted from the CLARA 3GHz 2.5 cell electron gun with exchangeable photocathode, which is a type of gun used for single pass high quality low emittance beams for uses such as Free Electron Lasers. The main purpose of these studies was to identify sources of dark current emission within the gun, by examining the dark current distribution and patterns on scintillating screens. It is shown that the features of the patterns can be reproduced qualitatively, and to some extent quantitatively, by finite element simulations. Thus, certain surfaces within the gun and cathode apparatus which contribute most significantly to problematic dark current can be identified, and further development and preparation of the guns and their cathodes can be informed to minimise dark current.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of coherent VUV radiation generated by 5.7 MeV electrons in a multilayer X-ray mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral and angular properties of diffracted transition radiation (DTR) and parametric radiation (PXR) in the ultrasoft X-ray region generated by the periodic structure upon interaction with a relativistic electron beam with energy of 5.7 MeV are numerically studied using a sample of the periodic structure [Mo/Si]50, known as a multilayer X-ray mirror. Based on calculations, an experimental approach is proposed to separate and identify the contributions of PXR and DTR. The ultrasoft X-ray radiation can be used to eliminate coherent effects occurring in the optical range when diagnosing the submicron electron beam size.</description>
