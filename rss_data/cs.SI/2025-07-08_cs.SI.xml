      <title>Dominance or Fair Play in Social Networks? A Model of Influencer Popularity Dynamic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven mean-field approach to model the popularity dynamics of users seeking public attention, i.e., influencers. We propose a novel analytical model that integrates individual activity patterns, expertise in producing viral content, exogenous events, and the platform's role in visibility enhancement, ultimately determining each influencer's success. We analytically derive sufficient conditions for system ergodicity, enabling predictions of popularity distributions. A sensitivity analysis explores various system configurations, highlighting conditions favoring either dominance or fair play among influencers. Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential evolution of social networks towards more equitable or biased influence ecosystems.</description>

      <title>VaxPulse: Active Global Vaccine Infodemic Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccine infodemics, driven by misinformation, disinformation, and inauthentic online behaviours, pose significant threats to global public health. This paper presents our response to this challenge, demonstrating how we developed VaxPulse Vaccine Infodemic Risk Assessment Lifecycle (VIRAL), an AI-powered social listening platform designed to monitor and assess vaccine-related infodemic risks. Leveraging interdisciplinary expertise and international collaborations, VaxPulse VIRAL integrates machine learning methods, including deep learning, active learning, and data augmentation, to provide real-time insights into public sentiments, misinformation trends, and social bot activity. Iterative feedback from domain experts and stakeholders has guided the development of dynamic dashboards that offer tailored, actionable insights to support immunisation programs and address information disorder. Ongoing improvements to VaxPulse will continue through collaboration with our international network and community leaders.</description>

      <title>Simulating User Watch-Time to Investigate Bias in YouTube Shorts Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-form video platforms such as YouTube Shorts increasingly shape how information is consumed, yet the effects of engagement-driven algorithms on content exposure remain poorly understood. This study investigates how different viewing behaviors, including fast scrolling or skipping, influence the relevance and topical continuity of recommended videos. Using a dataset of over 404,000 videos, we simulate viewer interactions across both broader geopolitical themes and more narrowly focused conflicts, including topics related to Russia, China, the Russia-Ukraine War, and the South China Sea dispute. We assess how relevance shifts across recommendation chains under varying watch-time conditions, using GPT-4o to evaluate semantic alignment between videos. Our analysis reveals patterns of amplification, drift, and topic generalization, with significant implications for content diversity and platform accountability. By bridging perspectives from computer science, media studies, and political communication, this work contributes a multidisciplinary understanding of how engagement cues influence algorithmic pathways in short-form content ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Investigating Algorithmic Bias in YouTube Shorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of YouTube Shorts, now serving over 2 billion monthly users, reflects a global shift toward short-form video as a dominant mode of online content consumption. This study investigates algorithmic bias in YouTube Shorts' recommendation system by analyzing how watch-time duration, topic sensitivity, and engagement metrics influence content visibility and drift. We focus on three content domains: the South China Sea dispute, the 2024 Taiwan presidential election, and general YouTube Shorts content. Using generative AI models, we classified 685,842 videos across relevance, topic category, and emotional tone. Our results reveal a consistent drift away from politically sensitive content toward entertainment-focused videos. Emotion analysis shows a systematic preference for joyful or neutral content, while engagement patterns indicate that highly viewed and liked videos are disproportionately promoted, reinforcing popularity bias. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of algorithmic drift in YouTube Shorts based on textual content, emotional tone, topic categorization, and varying watch-time conditions. These findings offer new insights into how algorithmic design shapes content exposure, with implications for platform transparency and information diversity.</description>

      <title>VaxPulse: Monitoring of Online Public Concerns to Enhance Post-licensure Vaccine Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent vaccine-related infodemic has amplified public concerns, highlighting the need for proactive misinformation management. We describe how we enhanced the reporting surveillance system of Victoria's vaccine safety service, SAEFVIC, through the incorporation of new information sources for public sentiment analysis, topics of discussion, and hesitancies about vaccinations online. Using VaxPulse, a multi-step framework, we integrate adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) with sentiment analysis, demonstrating the importance of contextualising public concerns. Additionally, we emphasise the need to address non-English languages to stratify concerns across ethno-lingual communities, providing valuable insights for vaccine uptake strategies and combating mis/disinformation. The framework is applied to real-world examples and a case study on women's vaccine hesitancy, showcasing its benefits and adaptability by identifying public opinion from online media.</description>

      <title>Advancement of Circular Economy Through Interdisciplinary Collaboration: A Bibliometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the European Union introduced its Circular Economy (CE) Action Plan in 2015, CE research has expanded rapidly. However, the structure of this emerging field - both in terms of its constituent disciplines and researcher dynamics - remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we analyze over 25,000 CE-related publications from Scopus by combining conventional bibliometric approaches with advanced machine learning techniques, including text embeddings and clustering. This hybrid method enables both a macro-level mapping of research domains and a micro-level investigation of individual researchers' disciplinary backgrounds and collaborations.
  We classify CE research into 16 distinct clusters, identifying the original disciplines of researchers and visualizing patterns of interdisciplinary collaboration. Building on this foundation, we ask: Which CE-related research domains receive the most attention in academic and policy contexts? And how are different types of interdisciplinary collaboration associated with research impact?
  Our findings show that research in business and management attracts substantial academic and policy attention, while engineering research - though less visible - tends to achieve higher funding success. This suggests a positive dynamic in which the former draws attention to CE issues and the latter secures the economic resources necessary to realize them.
  We further demonstrate that CE papers co-authored by researchers from different disciplines tend to show higher research impact than intradisciplinary work. Qualitative case analyses also highlight this tendency. Centered particularly on collaborations between business-oriented and engineering-oriented disciplines, our findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary efforts in CE research and offer insights for guiding future cross-disciplinary engagement in the field.</description>

      <title>Interest Networks (iNETs) for Cities: Cross-Platform Insights and Urban Behavior Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) provide a rich foundation for modeling urban behavior through iNETs (Interest Networks), which capture how user interests are distributed throughout urban spaces. This study compares iNETs across platforms (Google Places and Foursquare) and spatial granularities, showing that coarser levels reveal more consistent cross-platform patterns, while finer granularities expose subtle, platform-specific behaviors. Our analysis finds that, in general, user interest is primarily shaped by geographic proximity and venue similarity, while socioeconomic and political contexts play a lesser role. Building on these insights, we develop a multi-level, explainable recommendation system that predicts high-interest urban regions for different user types. The model adapts to behavior profiles -- such as explorers, who are driven by proximity, and returners, who prefer familiar venues -- and provides natural-language explanations using explainable AI (XAI) techniques. To support our approach, we introduce h3-cities, a tool for multi-scale spatial analysis, and release a public demo for interactively exploring personalized urban recommendations. Our findings contribute to urban mobility research by providing scalable, context-aware, and interpretable recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>User Location Disclosure Fails to Deter Overseas Criticism but Amplifies Regional Divisions on Chinese Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavioral impact of a user location disclosure policy implemented on Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging platform, using a high-frequency, real-time dataset of uncensored user engagement with 165 leading government and media accounts. Leveraging a natural experiment result from the platform's sudden rollout of location tagging on April 28, 2022, we compare millions of time-stamped observations of user behavior in the comment sections of these accounts before and after the policy change. Although the policy appeared intended to deter overseas users from spreading information deemed harmful by the regime, we find no reduction in their engagement. Instead, the policy sharply reduced domestic users' willingness to comment on posts about local issues outside their own provinces. This effect was especially pronounced among out-of-province commenters and disproportionately curtailed criticisms. Using large language models, we further show that location disclosure triggered a rise in regionally discriminatory replies, which in turn heightened the perceived risk of cross-provincial engagement and reshaped the norms of online participation. Our findings suggest that authoritarian regimes can reinforce censorship not only through top-down control, but by mobilizing social cleavages, here, regional divisions, to suppress dissent and fragment public discourse.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models' Varying Accuracy in Recognizing Risk-Promoting and Health-Supporting Sentiments in Public Health Discourse: The Cases of HPV Vaccination and Heated Tobacco Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments. Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the prevalence of certain perspectives.</description>

      <title>Measuring Social Media Network Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use representative, incentive-compatible online choice experiments involving 19,923 Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X users in the US to provide the first large-scale, empirical measurement of local network effects in the digital economy. Our analysis reveals social media platform value ranges from $78 to $101 per consumer, per month, on average, and that 20-34% of that value is explained by local network effects. We also find 1) stronger ties are more valuable on Facebook and Instagram, while weaker ties are more valuable on LinkedIn and X; 2) connections known through work are most valuable on LinkedIn and least valuable on Facebook, and people looking for work value LinkedIn significantly more and Facebook significantly less than people not looking for work; 3) men value connections to women on social media significantly more than they value connections to other men, particularly on Instagram, Facebook and X, while women value connections to men and women equally; 4) white consumers value relationships with other white consumers significantly more than they value relationships with non-white consumers on Facebook while, on Instagram, connections to alters eighteen years old or younger are valued significantly more than any other age group-two patterns not seen on any other platforms. Social media platforms individually generate between $53B and $215B in consumer surplus per year in the US alone. These results suggest social media generates significant value, local network effects drive a substantial fraction of that value and that these effects vary across platforms, consumers, and connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Perception of Security (PoS) refers to people's opinions about security or insecurity in a place or situation. While surveys have traditionally been the primary means to capture such perceptions, they need to be improved in their ability to offer real-time monitoring or predictive insights into future security perceptions. Recent evidence suggests that social network content can provide complementary insights into quantifying these perceptions. However, the challenge of accurately predicting these perceptions, with the capacity to anticipate them, still needs to be explored. This article introduces an innovative approach to PoS within short time frames using social network data. Our model incorporates external factors that influence the publication and reposting of content related to security perceptions. Our results demonstrate that this proposed model achieves competitive predictive performance and maintains a high degree of interpretability regarding the factors influencing security perceptions. This research contributes to understanding how temporal patterns and external factors impact the anticipation of security perceptions, providing valuable insights for proactive security planning.</description>

      <title>The Social Sphere Model: Heuristic Influence Prediction in Evolving Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How would admissions look like in a university program for influencers? In the realm of social network analysis, influence maximization and link prediction stand out as pivotal challenges. Influence maximization focuses on identifying a set of key nodes to maximize information dissemination, while link prediction aims to foresee potential connections within the network. These strategies, primarily deep learning link prediction methods and greedy algorithms, have been previously used in tandem to identify future influencers. However, given the complexity of these tasks, especially in large-scale networks, we propose an algorithm, The Social Sphere Model, which uniquely utilizes expected value in its future graph prediction and combines specifically path-based link prediction metrics and heuristic influence maximization strategies to effectively identify future vital nodes in weighted networks. Our approach is tested on two distinct contagion models, offering a promising solution with lower computational demands. This advancement not only enhances our understanding of network dynamics but also opens new avenues for efficient network management and influence strategy development.</description>

      <title>SHyPar: A Spectral Coarsening Approach to Hypergraph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art hypergraph partitioners utilize a multilevel paradigm to construct progressively coarser hypergraphs across multiple layers, guiding cut refinements at each level of the hierarchy. Traditionally, these partitioners employ heuristic methods for coarsening and do not consider the structural features of hypergraphs. In this work, we introduce a multilevel spectral framework, SHyPar, for partitioning large-scale hypergraphs by leveraging hyperedge effective resistances and flow-based community detection techniques. Inspired by the latest theoretical spectral clustering frameworks, such as HyperEF and HyperSF, SHyPar aims to decompose large hypergraphs into multiple subgraphs with few inter-partition hyperedges (cut size). A key component of SHyPar is a flow-based local clustering scheme for hypergraph coarsening, which incorporates a max-flow-based algorithm to produce clusters with substantially improved conductance. Additionally, SHyPar utilizes an effective resistance-based rating function for merging nodes that are strongly connected (coupled). Compared with existing state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning methods, our extensive experimental results on real-world VLSI designs demonstrate that SHyPar can more effectively partition hypergraphs, achieving state-of-the-art solution quality.</description>

      <title>The Nexus of AR/VR, AI, UI/UX, and Robotics Technologies in Enhancing Learning and Social Interaction for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs), augmented reality (AR), and user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design in therapies for children, especially with disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is studied in detail in this review study. 150 publications were collected by a thorough literature search throughout PubMed, ACM, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, and Google Scholar; 60 of them were chosen based on their methodological rigor and relevance to the focus area. Three of the primary areas are studied and covered in this review: how AR can improve social and learning results, how LLMs can support communication, and how UI/UX design affects how effective these technologies can be. Results show that while LLMs can provide individualized learning and communication support, AR has shown promise in enhancing social skills, motivation, and attention. For children with ASD, accessible and engaging interventions rely heavily on effective UI/UX design, but there is still a significant lack of robotics-based education and therapeutic programs specifically tailored for autistic children. To optimize the benefits of these technologies in ASD therapies and immersive education, the study emphasizes the need for additional research to address difficulties related to customization, accessibility, and integration.</description>

      <title>A Census-Based Genetic Algorithm for Target Set Selection Problem in Social Networks</title>

Abstract: This paper considers the Target Set Selection (TSS) Problem in social networks, a fundamental problem in viral marketing. In the TSS problem, a graph and a threshold value for each vertex of the graph are given. We need to find a minimum size vertex subset to "activate" such that all graph vertices are activated at the end of the propagation process. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called "a census-based genetic algorithm" for the TSS problem. In our algorithm, we use the idea of a census to gather and store information about each individual in a population and collect census data from the individuals constructed during the algorithm's execution so that we can achieve greater diversity and avoid premature convergence at locally optimal solutions. We use two distinct census information: (a) for each individual, the algorithm stores how many times it has been identified during the execution (b) for each network node, the algorithm counts how many times it has been included in a solution. The proposed algorithm can also self-adjust by using a parameter specifying the aggressiveness employed in each reproduction method. Additionally, the algorithm is designed to run in a parallelized environment to minimize the computational cost and check each individual's feasibility. Moreover, our algorithm finds the optimal solution in all cases while experimenting on random graphs. Furthermore, we execute the proposed algorithm on 14 large graphs of real-life social network instances from the literature, improving around 9.57 solution size (on average) and 134 vertices (in total) compared to the best solutions obtained in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Clustering Coefficient Reflecting Pairwise Relationships within Hyperedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are generalizations of simple graphs that allow for the representation of complex group interactions beyond pairwise relationships. Clustering coefficients quantify local link density in networks and have been widely studied for both simple graphs and hypergraphs. However, existing clustering coefficients for hypergraphs treat each hyperedge as a distinct unit rather than a collection of potentially related node pairs, failing to capture intra-hyperedge pairwise relationships and incorrectly assigning zero values to nodes with meaningful clustering patterns. We propose a novel clustering coefficient that addresses this fundamental limitation by transforming hypergraphs into weighted graphs, where edge weights reflect relationship strength between nodes based on hyperedge connections. Our definition satisfies three key conditions: values in the range $[0,1]$, consistency with simple graph clustering coefficients, and effective capture of intra-hyperedge pairwise relationships -- a capability absent from existing approaches. Theoretical evaluation on higher-order motifs demonstrates that our definition correctly assigns values to motifs where existing definitions fail (motifs III, IV-a, IV-b of order 3), while empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets shows similar overall clustering tendencies with more detailed measurements, especially for hypergraphs with larger hyperedges. The proposed clustering coefficient enables accurate quantification of local density in complex networks, revealing structural characteristics missed by existing definitions in systems where group membership implies connections between members, such as social communities and co-authorship networks.</description>

      <title>Hypermodularity and community detection in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous networked systems feature a structure of nontrivial communities, which often correspond to their functional modules. Such communities have been detected in real-world biological, social and technological systems, as well as in synthetic models thereof. While much effort has been devoted to developing methods for community detection in traditional networks, the study of community structure in networks with higher-order interactions is still not as extensively explored. In this article, we introduce a formalism for the hypermodularity of higher-order networks that allows us to use spectral methods to detect community structures in hypergraphs. We apply this approach to synthetic random networks as well as to real-world data, showing that it produces results that reflect the nature and the dynamics of the interactions modelled, thereby constituting a valuable tool for the extraction of hidden information from complex higher-order data sets.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Local Search Approach for Polarized Community Discovery in Signed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signed networks, where edges are labeled as positive or negative to represent friendly or antagonistic interactions, offer a natural framework for analyzing polarization, trust, and conflict in social systems. Detecting meaningful group structures in such networks is crucial for understanding online discourse, political divisions, and trust dynamics. A key challenge is to identify communities that are internally cohesive and externally antagonistic, while allowing for neutral or unaligned vertices. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying $k$ polarized communities that addresses a major limitation of prior methods: their tendency to produce highly size-imbalanced solutions. We introduce a novel optimization objective that avoids such imbalance. In addition, it is well known that approximation algorithms based on local search are highly effective for clustering signed networks when neutral vertices are not allowed. We build on this idea and design the first local search algorithm that extends to the setting with neutral vertices while scaling to large networks. By connecting our approach to block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe optimization, we prove a linear convergence rate, enabled by the structure of our objective. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, while remaining competitive in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AI capabilities in detecting conspiracy theories on YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a leading online platform with a vast global audience, YouTube's extensive reach also makes it susceptible to hosting harmful content, including disinformation and conspiracy theories. This study explores the use of open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs), both text-only and multimodal, for identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled dataset of thousands of videos, we evaluate a variety of LLMs in a zero-shot setting and compare their performance to a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline. Results show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only counterparts, indicating limited benefits from visual data integration. To assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an unlabeled dataset, finding that RoBERTa achieves performance close to LLMs with a larger number of parameters. Our work highlights the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based approaches for online harmful content detection, emphasizing the need for more precise and robust systems.</description>
