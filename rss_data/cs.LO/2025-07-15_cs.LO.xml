      <title>Computability of Equivariant Gr\"obner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field, $\mathcal{X}$ be an infinite set (of indeterminates), and $\mathcal{G}$ be a group acting on $\mathcal{X}$. An ideal in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{K}[\mathcal{X}]$ is called equivariant if it is invariant under the action of $\mathcal{G}$. We show Gr\"obner bases for equivariant ideals are computable are hence the equivariant ideal membership is decidable when $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{X}$ satisfies the Hilbert's basis property, that is, when every equivariant ideal in $\mathbb{K}[\mathcal{X}]$ is finitely generated. Moreover, we give a sufficient condition for the undecidability of the equivariant ideal membership problem. This condition is satisfied by the most common examples not satisfying the Hilbert's basis property.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Effective ASP-Based Tool for Enumerating Minimal Hitting Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hitting set problem is a fundamental problem in computer science and mathematics. Given a family of sets over a universe of elements, a minimal hitting set is a subset-minimal collection of elements that intersects each set in the family. Enumerating all minimal hitting sets is crucial in various real-world applications.
  In this paper, we address the full enumeration of all minimal hitting sets for a given family of sets. We formulate the problem using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and leverage existing ASP solvers for efficient enumeration. We propose an ASP-based tool, MinHit-ASP, and our empirical evaluation shows that it effectively enumerates minimal hitting sets across benchmarks from diverse problem domains.</description>

      <title>Recovering Commutation of Logically Constrained Rewriting and Equivalence Transformations (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logically constrained term rewriting is a relatively new rewriting formalism that naturally supports built-in data structures, such as integers and bit vectors. In the analysis of logically constrained term rewrite systems (LCTRSs), rewriting constrained terms plays a crucial role. However, this combines rewrite rule applications and equivalence transformations in a closely intertwined way. This intertwining makes it difficult to establish useful theoretical properties for this kind of rewriting and causes problems in implementations -- namely, that impractically large search spaces are often required. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel notion of most general constrained rewriting, which operates on existentially constrained terms, a concept recently introduced by the authors. We define a class of left-linear, left-value-free LCTRSs that are general enough to simulate all left-linear LCTRSs and exhibit the desired key property: most general constrained rewriting commutes with equivalence. This property ensures that equivalence transformations can be deferred until after the application of rewrite rules, which helps mitigate the issue of large search spaces in implementations. In addition to that, we show that the original rewriting formalism on constrained terms can be embedded into our new rewriting formalism on existentially constrained terms. Thus, our results are expected to have significant implications for achieving correct and efficient implementations in tools operating on LCTRSs.</description>

      <title>Non-Termination of Logic Programs Using Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an approach introduced in term rewriting for the automatic detection of non-looping non-termination from patterns of rules. We adapt it to logic programming by defining a new unfolding technique that produces patterns describing possibly infinite sets of finite rewrite sequences. We present an experimental evaluation of our contributions that we implemented in our tool NTI.</description>

      <title>Justification Logic for Intuitionistic Modal Logic (Extended Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Justification logics are an explication of modal logic; boxes are replaced with proof terms formally through realisation theorems. This can be achieved syntactically using a cut-free proof system e.g. using sequent, hypersequent or nested sequent calculi. In constructive modal logic, boxes and diamonds are decoupled and not De Morgan dual. Kuznets, Marin and Stra{\ss}burger provide a justification counterpart to constructive modal logic CK and some extensions by making diamonds explicit by introducing new terms called satisfiers. We continue the line of work to provide a justification counterpart to Fischer Servi's intuitionistic modal logic IK and its extensions with the t and 4 axioms. We: extend the syntax of proof terms to accommodate the additional axioms of intuitionistic modal logic; provide an axiomatisation of these justification logics; provide a syntactic realisation procedure using a cut-free nested sequent system for intuitionistic modal logic introduced by Stra{\ss}burger.</description>

      <title>A Study Of Sudoku Solving Algorithms: Backtracking and Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of Sudoku-solving strategies, focusing on recursive backtracking and a heuristic-based constraint propagation method. Using a dataset of 500 puzzles across five difficulty levels (Beginner to Expert), we evaluated performance based on average solving time. The heuristic approach consistently outperformed backtracking, achieving speedup ratios ranging from 1.27x in Beginner puzzles to 2.91x in Expert puzzles. These findings underscore the effectiveness of heuristic strategies, particularly in tackling complex puzzles across varying difficulty levels.</description>

      <title>Extending Defeasibility for Propositional Standpoint Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new defeasible version of propositional standpoint logic by integrating Kraus et al.'s defeasible conditionals, Britz and Varzinczak's notions of defeasible necessity and distinct possibility, along with Leisegang et al.'s approach to defeasibility into the standpoint logics of G\'omez \'Alvarez and Rudolph. The resulting logical framework allows for the expression of defeasibility on the level of implications, standpoint modal operators, and standpoint-sharpening statements. We provide a preferential semantics for this extended language and propose a tableaux calculus, which is shown to be sound and complete with respect to preferential entailment. We also establish the computational complexity of the tableaux procedure to be in PSpace.</description>

      <title>A simple formalization of alpha-equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While teaching untyped $\lambda$-calculus to undergraduate students, we were wondering why $\alpha$-equivalence is not directly inductively defined. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is indeed feasible. Specifically, we provide a grounded, inductive definition for $\alpha$-equivalence and show that it conforms to the specification provided in the literature. The work presented in this paper is fully formalized in the Rocq Prover.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Programming Language for Coherent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a programming language that allows for the coherent control of arbitrary quantum operations. The problem of defining coherent control beyond the unitary case, using, for example, a quantum conditional in the presence of recursion or iteration has long been known to be a major difficulty. We resolve this problem by defining an operational semantics based on appropriate Kraus decompositions and a denotational semantics based on vacuum-extensions. We show that the language is universal for vacuum-extensions and that the two semantics are adequate. Moreover, we define a notion of observational equivalence: two programs are equivalent if their probability of termination is the same in any context. The denotational semantics is shown to be fully abstract for observational equivalence.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Closure of Matrix Sets Recognized by 1-VASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known how to compute the Zariski closure of a finitely generated monoid of matrices and, more generally, of a set of matrices specified by a regular language. This result was recently used to give a procedure to compute all polynomial invariants of a given affine program. Decidability of the more general problem of computing all polynomial invariants of affine programs with recursive procedure calls remains open. Mathematically speaking, the core challenge is to compute the Zariski closure of a set of matrices defined by a context-free language. In this paper, we approach the problem from two sides: Towards decidability, we give a procedure to compute the Zariski closure of sets of matrices given by one-counter languages (that is, languages accepted by one-dimensional vector addition systems with states and zero tests), a proper subclass of context-free languages. On the other side, we show that the problem becomes undecidable for indexed languages, a natural extension of context-free languages corresponding to nested pushdown automata. One of our main technical tools is a novel adaptation of Simon's factorization forests to infinite monoids of matrices.</description>

      <title>Sound and Complete Neuro-symbolic Reasoning with LLM-Grounded Interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs' broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.</description>

      <title>AssertCoder: LLM-Based Assertion Generation via Multimodal Specification Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) is critical for ensuring functional correctness in modern hardware systems. However, manually writing high-quality SVAs remains labor-intensive and error-prone. To bridge this gap, we propose AssertCoder, a novel unified framework that automatically generates high-quality SVAs directly from multimodal hardware design specifications. AssertCoder employs a modality-sensitive preprocessing to parse heterogeneous specification formats (text, tables, diagrams, and formulas), followed by a set of dedicated semantic analyzers that extract structured representations aligned with signal-level semantics. These representations are utilized to drive assertion synthesis via multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The framework incorporates a mutation-based evaluation approach to assess assertion quality via model checking and further refine the generated assertions. Experimental evaluation across three real-world Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs demonstrates AssertCoder's superior performance, achieving an average increase of 8.4% in functional correctness and 5.8% in mutation detection compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Consensus, Inconsistency, Emergence: what's paraconsistency got to do with it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consensus problem, briefly stated, consists of having processes in an asynchronous distributed system agree on a value. It is widely known that the consensus problem does not have a deterministic solution that ensures both termination and consistency, if there is at least one faulty process in the system. This result, known as the FLP impossibility theorem, led to several generalizations and developments in theoretical distributed computing. This paper argues that the FLP impossibility theorem holds even under a generalized definition of computation through oracles. Furthermore, using a theoretical machinery from complex systems, this paper also posits that inconsistency may be an emergent feature of consensus over distributed systems by examining how a system transitions phases. Under the same complex systems framework, this paper examines paraconsistent logics, arguing that while inconsistency is not an emergent feature for these logics, triviality may be. Lastly, some attention is given to the possibility of developing consensus algorithms capable of paraconsistent reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to use orthologic as the basis for designing type systems supporting intersection, union, and negation types in the presence of subtyping assumptions. We show how to extend orthologic to support monotonic and antimonotonic functions, supporting the use of type constructors in such type systems. We present a proof system for orthologic with function symbols, showing that it admits partial cut elimination. Using these insights, we present an $\mathcal O(n^2(1+m))$ algorithm for deciding the subtyping relation under $m$ assumptions. We also show $O(n^2)$ polynomial-time normalization algorithm, allowing simplification of types to their minimal canonical form.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Second-order HyperLTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15675v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the complexity of second-order HyperLTL satisfiability, finite-state satisfiability, and model-checking: All three are equivalent to truth in third-order arithmetic. We also consider two fragments of second-order HyperLTL that have been introduced with the aim to facilitate effective model-checking by restricting the sets one can quantify over. The first one restricts second-order quantification to smallest/largest sets that satisfy a guard while the second one restricts second-order quantification further to least fixed points of (first-order) HyperLTL definable functions. All three problems for the first fragment are still equivalent to truth in third-order arithmetic while satisfiability for the second fragment is $\Sigma_1^2$-complete, and finite-state satisfiability and model-checking are equivalent to truth in second-order arithmetic. Finally, we also introduce closed-world semantics for second-order HyperLTL, where set quantification ranges only over subsets of the model, while set quantification in standard semantics ranges over arbitrary sets of traces. Here, satisfiability for the least fixed point fragment becomes $\Sigma_1^1$-complete, but all other results are unaffected.</description>

      <title>Induction and Recursion Principles in a Higher-Order Quantitative Logic for Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative logic reasons about the degree to which formulas are satisfied. This paper studies the fundamental reasoning principles of higher-order quantitative logic and their application to reasoning about probabilistic programs and processes.
  We construct an affine calculus for $1$-bounded complete metric spaces and the monad for probability measures equipped with the Kantorovic distance. The calculus includes a form of guarded recursion interpreted via Banach's fixed point theorem, useful, e.g., for recursive programming with processes. We then define an affine higher-order quantitative logic for reasoning about terms of our calculus. The logic includes novel principles for guarded recursion, and induction over probability measures and natural numbers.
  We illustrate the expressivity of the logic by a sequence of case studies: Proving upper limits on bisimilarity distances of Markov processes, showing convergence of a temporal learning algorithm and of a random walk using a coupling argument. Finally we show how to encode a probabilistic Hoare logic in our logic.</description>

Abstract: We define base-extension semantics (Bes) using atomic systems based on sequent calculus rather than natural deduction. While traditional Bes aligns naturally with intuitionistic logic due to its constructive foundations, we show that sequent calculi with multiple conclusions yield a Bes framework more suited to classical semantics. The harmony in classical sequents leads to straightforward semantic clauses derived solely from right introduction rules. This framework enables a Sandqvist-style completeness proof that extracts a sequent calculus proof from any valid semantic consequence. Moreover, we show that the inclusion or omission of atomic cut rules meaningfully affects the semantics, yet completeness holds in both cases.</description>

      <title>A very sharp threshold for first order logic distinguishability of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we find an integer $h=h(n)$ such that the minimum number of variables of a first order sentence that distinguishes between two independent uniformly distributed random graphs of size $n$ with the asymptotically largest possible probability $\frac{1}{4}-o(1)$ belongs to $\{h,h+1,h+2,h+3\}$. We also prove that the minimum (random) $k$ such that two independent random graphs are distinguishable by a first order sentence with $k$ variables belongs to $\{h,h+1,h+2\}$ with probability $1-o(1)$.</description>

      <title>The Big-O Problem for Max-Plus Automata is Decidable (PSPACE-Complete)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the big-O problem for max-plus automata is decidable and PSPACE-complete. The big-O (or affine domination) problem asks whether, given two max-plus automata computing functions f and g, there exists a constant c such that f &lt; cg+ c. This is a relaxation of the containment problem asking whether f &lt; g, which is undecidable. Our decidability result uses Simon's forest factorisation theorem, and relies on detecting specific elements, that we call witnesses, in a finite semigroup closed under two special operations: stabilisation and flattening.</description>

      <title>Cryptis: Cryptographic Reasoning in Separation Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Cryptis, an extension of the Iris separation logic that can be used to verify cryptographic components using the symbolic model of cryptography. The combination of separation logic and cryptographic reasoning allows us to prove the correctness of a protocol and later reuse this result to verify larger systems that rely on the protocol. To make this integration possible, we propose novel specifications for authentication protocols that allow agents in a network to agree on the use of system resources. We evaluate our approach by verifying various authentication protocols and a key-value store server that uses these authentication protocols to connect to clients. Our results are formalized in Coq.</description>
