      <title>Boundary imprint of bulk causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the holographic correspondence, we study the boundary imprint of bulk lightcones in spacetimes with boundaries. These lightcones can be observed whenever a localized event takes place in the bulk. The associated boundary surfaces (hyperboloids) reveal the bulk conformal metric. We work out a Hamilton-Jacobi description of these surfaces and analyze them in explicit examples. Bulk causality translates into a boundary inclusion property from which the bulk geodesic equation can be derived under some assumptions.</description>

      <title>An unusual BPS equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</description>

      <title>Physics on manifolds with exotic differential structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A given topological manifold can sometimes be endowed with inequivalent differential structures. Physically this means that what is meant by a differentiable function (smooth) is simply different for observers using inequivalent differential structures. Specifically, that means that one observer will say that this is a smooth function while the other observer will say it is not smooth. On the other hand, the notion of a continuous function is the same for both, defined by the common topology. In this paper, we examine the import of inequivalent differential structures on the physics of fields obeying the Dirac equation on the 7-sphere. The 7-sphere was the first, celebrated example, found by Milnor, of a topological manifold that can be endowed with a finite number, 28, of inequivalent differential structures. We find that the spectra of these operators are dependent on the choice of differential structure and hence the identical topological manifolds have different physical laws.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Correction to the Casimir Energy in Lorentz-Violating $\phi^4$ Theory with Rough Membrane Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the radiative correction to the Casimir energy for both massive and massless Lorentz-violating scalar fields confined between two membranes with rough surfaces in a 3+1 dimensional spacetime. The computations are performed for four types of boundary conditions: Dirichlet, Neumann, Periodic, and Mixed. A crucial element of our approach involves the use of position-dependent counterterms to incorporate the influence of boundaries within the renormalization program. To manage the divergences that emerge in the Casimir energy calculations, we apply the Box Subtraction Scheme (BSS) along with the cutoff regularization technique. We present and discuss results for various degrees of membrane roughness, emphasizing the consistency of our findings with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Flow Equations in Daubechies Wavelet Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low energy dynamics of a system of two coupled real scalar fields in 1+1 dimensions using the flow equation approach of Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) in a wavelet basis. This paper presents an extension of the work by Michlin and Polyzou \cite{PhysRevD.95.094501} at one resolution higher. We also present the analysis of a model of two scalar fields coupled through a generally quadratic interaction in $1+1$ dimensions using wavelet-based flow equations. We demonstrate that the specifically chosen generator flows the Hamiltonian into a block diagonal form with each diagonal block being associated with a fixed resolution. The wavelet basis is known to transform the scalar field theory into a model of coupled localized oscillators, each of which is labelled by location and resolution indices. The chosen interaction represents the coupling between two types of oscillators at the same location and resolution index. There is no coupling between oscillators across locations and resolutions. We show that wavelet-based flow equations carry out scale separation while maintaining the interactions between the two scalar fields at each resolution. The effective Hamiltonian associated with the coarsest resolution is shown to correctly reproduce the normal mode frequencies of the model.</description>

      <title>Rademacher expansion of modular integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate integrals of non-holomorphic modular functions over the fundamental domain of the torus with modular parameter $\tau$ analytically. It proceeds in two steps: first the integral is transformed to a Lorentzian contour by the same strategy that leads to the Lorentzian inversion formula in CFT, and then we apply a two-dimensional version of the Rademacher expansion. This computes the integral in terms of an expansion sensitive to the singular behaviour of the integrand near all the Lorentzian cusps $\tau \to i \infty$, $\bar{\tau} \to x \in \mathbb{Q}$. We apply this technique to a variety of examples such as the evaluation of string one-loop partition functions, where it leads to the first analytic formula for the cosmological constants of the bosonic string and the $\mathrm{SO}(16) \times \mathrm{SO}(16)$ string.</description>

      <title>Localization and wall-crossing of giant graviton expansions in AdS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\frac12$-BPS indices of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory with unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic groups all admit $q$-expansions suggesting an interpretation in terms of D-branes in the dual bulk AdS$_5$ string theories. We present a derivation of these expansions in the corresponding bulk duals by quantizing the moduli space of $\frac12$-BPS giant gravitons using supersymmetric localization, extending and clarifying our study in arxiv:2312.14921. We perform a detailed analysis of the one-loop fluctuations around the maximal giants (the fixed points), and show how the Hamiltonian analysis is recovered from the functional integral for the equivariant index. We show that the analytic continuation for these giant graviton expansions observed in the literature maps precisely to a wall-crossing phenomenon for the index. In the case of orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quotient in the bulk leads to a corresponding projection in the $q$-expansion. Additional terms in the expansion related to the Pfaffian operator arise from topologically stable branes in the bulk dual on AdS$_5 \times \mathbb{RP}^5$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the cosmological evolution parameters, energy conditions, and linear matter perturbations of an exponential-type model in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological evolution in a flat FLRW spacetime in the context of modified STEGR gravity or $f(Q)$, using an exponential two-parameter model which represents a smooth perturbative expansion around the $\Lambda$CDM model. The cosmological analysis is carried out by calculating the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, for selected values of the parameters. The Hubble parameter is obtained analytically by means of several approximations good enough to deviate slightly from the $\Lambda$CDM case. Several late-time cosmological parameters are computed, such as: dark energy state parameter, deceleration parameter, statefinder parameters. Additionally, we analyzed the behavior of the classical energy conditions WEC, SEC, NEC, and DEC for both the combination of matter and geometrical contribution and the geometrical contribution alone. Beyond the background level, linear matter perturbations are studied by calculating parameters relevant to structure growth and formation. The overall results indicate that the model may exhibit quintessence-like and phantom-like behavior and it impacts the growth of structures in the universe by means late-time deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>The Open Relativistic Two-body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open relativistic two-body problem, when two interacting particles also are in external potentials, is considered in terms of the principle of the least action. Based on the consistent modification of the relativistic version Newton's third law in external fields, the exact covariant operator equations, which govern dynamics of either a scalar particle or each of the components of the 16 component spinor of spin-$1/2$ fermions, depending on the particle type, are derived in the center-mass and relative motion variables, beyond the consideration in the Breit frame only. The class of external fields and interaction potentials, when the two-body problem can be covariantly reformulated in (3+1) phase space of relative motion variables, uncoupled from the center-mass motion of such a system, is outlined. In the case of fermions the new $\gamma$-matrix basis generating the Dirac-like equation for the 16 component spinors in the (3+1) phase space is found. The chosen basis allows us to decouple the derived Dirac-like equation into four independent equations governing the dynamics of the four-component spinors. The developed approach is examined in studying the low-energy positronium states in magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Are there minimal exceptional aGUTs from stable 5D orbifolds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analysing five dimensional orbifolds with exceptional gauge groups, we seek to find stable vacua configurations which satisfy the minimal requirements for asymptotic grand unified models. In this respect we show that no minimal asymptotic grand unified theory can be built. Our results point towards non-minimal models based on $E_6$: one featuring supersymmetry, and the other needing a modification of the Coleman-Weinberg potential to stabilise the breaking of $E_6$ to the standard model gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review the contributions of Giorgio Parisi to perturbative QCD. Concentrated in a decade, they mark the transition of the theory of strong interactions from a set of loosely connected ideas based on models, to a quantum field theory that is now an integral part of the standard model of fundamental interactions. Parisi's contributions have established at a very early stage ideas, methods and tools that are now standard, and in several cases anticipated results that only became prominent in the XXIst century.</description>

      <title>Native Three-Body Interactions in a Superconducting Lattice Gauge Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While universal quantum computers remain under development, analog quantum simulators offer a powerful alternative for understanding complex systems in condensed matter, chemistry, and high-energy physics. One compelling application is the characterization of real-time lattice gauge theories (LGTs). LGTs are nonperturbative tools, utilizing discretized spacetime to describe gauge-invariant models. They hold immense potential for understanding fundamental physics but require enforcing local constraints analogous to electromagnetism's Gauss's Law. These constraints, which arise from gauge symmetries and dictate the form of the interaction between matter and gauge fields, are a significant challenge for simulators to enforce. Implementing these constraints at the hardware level in analog simulations is crucial. This requires realizing multibody interactions between matter and gauge-field elements, enabling them to evolve together while suppressing unwanted two-body interactions that violate the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel parametrically activated three-qubit interaction within a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. We experimentally demonstrate a minimal $U(1)$ spin-1/2 model with a time evolution that intrinsically satisfies Gauss's law in the system. This design serves as the foundational block for simulating LGTs on a superconducting photonic lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An isolated supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) produces an identical cross-correlation pattern of pulsar timings as an isotropic stochastic background gravitational waves (GWs) generated possibly by inflation. Can there remain the identical cross-correlation pattern in the presence of a secondary SMBHB? To address this issue, the present paper considers GWs with slightly different frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ coming from two different directions. Beats between the two GWs can modify angular correlation patterns. The beat-induced correlation patterns are not stationary but modulated with a beat frequency $f_{beat} \equiv |f_1 - f_2|$. We obtain an analytic formula to present a proof-of-principle that $f_{beat}$ can be measured from the modulated angular correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider higher-dimensional uniform inflation, in which the extra dimensions expand at the same rate as three-dimensional non-compact space during inflation. We compute the cosmological perturbation in $D+4$ dimensions and derive the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-scalar ratio $r$. We analyze five inflationary models: chaotic inflation, natural inflation, quartic hilltop inflation, inflation with spontaneously broken SUSY, and $R^2$ inflation. By combining the results from these models with the Planck 2018 constraints, we discuss that it is not desirable for the extra-dimensional space to expand at the same rate as the three-dimensional non-compact space, except for the case of one extra dimension.</description>

Abstract: These notes contain -- apart from some physics -- scattered reminiscences of everyday life at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in G\"oteborg in the early eighties. The text has been in the making for many years. Some of it was written inspired by the Lars Brink 70-fest at The Solvay Institute in Brussels in 2014, but was never finished or published. Parts of the old text has now been replaced by a review of the quite unexpected recent renaissance for light-front higher spin theory. Lars sadly did not live to experience more than the very beginnings of this quite remarkable development. The text was finalized in the spring of 2023.</description>

      <title>Exploring gravitational impulse via quantum Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE equation operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Similarly, we apply this approach to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the forward scattering term of the extended QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While this term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. Through this procedure, we obtain the leading order of the system's impulse. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</description>

      <title>On thermodynamics of charged and accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider various C-metric spacetimes describing charged and (slowly) accelerating AdS black holes in different theories of (non-linear) electrodynamics and revisit their thermodynamic properties. Focusing first on the Maxwell theory, we find a parametrization of the metric where we can eliminate the non-trivial `normalization' of the boost Killing vector which was crucial for obtaining consistent thermodynamics in previous studies. We also calculate the Euclidean action using i) the standard holographic renormalization and ii) using the topological renormalization, showing that in the presence of overall cosmic string tension the two do not agree. These results are also extended to accelerating black holes in ModMax and RegMax non-linear electrodynamics. Interestingly, for the latter the electrostatic potential picks up a modification, that remains to be explained, but is consistent with the topological renormalization and the (generalized) Hawking--Ross prescription. Our study indicates that thermodynamics of charged accelerating black holes is far from being completely understood.</description>

      <title>Effective string description of the reconfined phase in the trace deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2+1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of the flux tube in the reconfined phase of the trace deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. In this phase the Polyakov loop has a vanishing expectation value (and center symmetry is recovered) even at high temperatures. We study, by means of numerical simulations, the confining potential between two Polyakov loops. We show that its behaviour is very different from that of usual confining gauge models and shows a remarkable agreement with the predictions of the so called "rigid string" in the limit in which the rigidity term (i.e. a term proportional to the square of the extrinsic curvature of the string) is very large and is the dominant contribution in the action.</description>

      <title>Naked and truly naked rotating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, it was noticed that in some space-times with Killing horizons some curvature components, responsible for tidal forces, small or even zero in the static frame, become enhanced from the viewpoint of a falling observer. This leads to the notion of so-called naked black holes. If some components in the frame attached to a free-falling observer formally diverge, although scalar invariants remain finite, such space-times was named "truly naked black holes" (in mathematical language, one can speak about non-scalar singularity). Previous results included static spherically symmetric or distorted static metrics. In the present work, we generalized them to include rotation in consideration. We also scrutiny how the algebraic type can change in the vicinity of the horizon due to local Lorentz boost. Our approach essentially uses the Newman-Penrose formalism, so we analyze the behavior of Weyl scalar for different kinds of observers.</description>

      <title>Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.</description>

Abstract: What happens when fermions hop on a lattice with crystalline defects? The answer depends on topological quantum numbers which specify the action of lattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. One can understand the topological quantum numbers as a twist of continuum gauge fields in terms of crystalline gauge fields. We find that disclinations and dislocations -- defects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a certain ``emanant'' quantized magnetic flux. To demonstrate these facts, we study in detail tight-binding models whose low-energy descriptions are (2+1)D Dirac cones. Our map from lattice to continuum defects explains the crystalline topological response to disclinations and dislocations, and motivates the fermion crystalline equivalence principle used in the classification of crystalline topological phases. When the gap closes, the presence of emanant flux leads to pair creation from the vacuum with the particles and anti-particles swirling around the defect. We compute the associated currents and energy density using the tools of defect conformal field theory. There is a rich set of renormalization group fixed points, depending on how particles scatter from the defect. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold leading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive numerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and we test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail. We also point out a no-go result, which implies that a single (2+1)D Dirac cone in symmetry class AII is incompatible with a commuting $C_M$ rotational symmetry with $(C_M)^M = +1$.</description>

      <title>Scalar field source Teleparallel Robertson-Walker F(T)-gravity solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a scalar field source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case added by a scalar field to find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For $k=0$, we find an easy-to-compute $F(T)$ solution formula applicable for any scalar field source. Then, we obtain, for $k=-1$ and $+1$ situations, some new analytical $F(T)$ solutions, only for specific $n$-parameter values and well-determined scalar field cases. We can find by those computations a large number of analytical teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions independent of any scalar potential $V(\phi)$ expression. The $V(\phi)$ independence makes the FE solving and computations easier. The new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications in dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy and quintom models of physical processes.</description>

Abstract: In celestial holography, the massive and massless scalars in 4d space-time are represented by the Fourier transform of the bulk-to-boundary propagators and the Mellin transform of plane waves respectively. Recently, the 3pt celestial amplitude of one massive scalar and two massless scalars was discussed in arXiv:2312.08597. In this paper, we compute the 3pt celestial amplitude of two massive scalars and one massless scalar. Then we take the massless limit $m\to 0$ for one of the massive scalars, during which process the gamma function $\Gamma(1-\Delta)$ appears. By requiring the resulting amplitude to be well-defined, that is it goes to the 3pt amplitude of arXiv:2312.08597, the scaling dimension of this massive scalar has to be conformally soft $\Delta \to 1$. The pole $1/(1-\Delta)$ coming from $\Gamma(1-\Delta)$ is crucial for this massless limit. Without it the resulting amplitude would be zero. This can be compared with the conformal soft limit in celestial gluon amplitudes, where a singularity $1/(\Delta -1)$ arises and the leading contribution comes from the soft energy $\omega\to 0$. The phase factors in the massless limit of massive conformal primary wave functions, dicussed in arXiv:1705.01027, plays an import and consistent role in the celestial massive amplitudes. Furthermore, the subleading orders $m^{2n}$ can also contribute poles when the scaling dimension is analytically continued to $\Delta=1-n$ or $\Delta = 2$, and we find that this consistent massless limit only exists for dimensions belonging to the generalized conformal primary operators $\Delta \in 2-\mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 0}$ of massless bosons.</description>

      <title>Generation of effective massive Spin-2 fields through spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity and quantum field theory are the cornerstones of our understanding of physical processes, from subatomic to cosmic scales. While both theories work remarkably well in their tested domains, they show minimal overlap. However, our research challenges this separation by revealing that non-perturbative effects bridge these distinct domains. We introduce a novel mechanism wherein, at linear order, spin-2 fields around an arbitrary background acquire \emph{effective mass} due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of either global or local symmetry of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. The action of the spin-2 field is identical to the extended Fierz-Pauli (FP) action, corresponding to the mass deformation parameter $\alpha = 1/2$. We show that this occurs due to the effect of SSB on the variation of the energy-momentum tensor of the matter field, which has a dominant effect during SSB. The extended FP action has a salient feature, compared to the standard FP action: the action has 6 degrees of freedom with no ghosts. For local $U(1)$ SSB, we establish that the effective mass of spin-2 fields is related to the mass of the gauge boson and the electric charge of the complex scalar field. Interestingly, our results indicate that the millicharged dark matter scalar fields, generating dark photons, can produce a mass of spin-2 fields of the same order as the Hubble constant $(H_0)$. Hence, we argue that the dark sector offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of the current Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of steady flows in a holographic first-order phase transition model, extending from the thermodynamics at equilibrium to the real-time dynamics far from equilibrium. Through spinodal decomposition or condensation nuclei, the phase-separated state with non-zero momentum can be achieved. In this scenario, we observe a gap between coexisting phases, arising not only from the variations in energy density, but also from the distinctions in momentum density or longitudinal pressure. These disparities are characterized by flow velocity and latent heat. Furthermore, by introducing an inhomogeneous scalar external source to simulate a fixed obstacle, we reveal the dynamical response of momentum loss in the moving system. Notably, starting from an initial phase-separated state with uniform flow velocity, and subsequently interacting it with an obstacle, we find that the moving high-energy phase exhibits four characteristic dynamical behaviors -- rebounding, pinning, passing, and splitting. These behaviors depend on the velocity of the phase and the strength of the obstacle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for AdS$_3$ solutions of $d=11$ supergravity to preserve ${\cal N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetry in terms of G-structures. Such solutions necessarily support an SU(3)-structure on the internal 8-manifold M$_8$, in terms of which we phrase the conditions for supersymmetry preservation. We use this to derive the local form of all ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solutions in $d=11$, for which M$_8$ decomposes as a foliation of a 3-sphere over a 5 dimensional base. There are 3 independent classes, 2 of which preserve the small superconformal algebra and one preserving its large counterpart for which M$_5$ contains a second 3-sphere. We show that for each solution with large (4,4) supersymmetry there are two corresponding solutions with small $(4,4)$, one for which M$_5$ maintains its 3-sphere, one where this blows up to $\mathbb{R}^3$ which can be compactified to $\mathbb{T}^3$. We use our results to construct several new solutions that lie within our derived classes as well as recovering some existing solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a scalar field in the nonintegrable $\displaystyle \phi ^{4}$ model, restricted to the half-line. Here we consider singular solutions that interpolate the Dirichlet boundary condition $\phi(x=0,t)=H$ and their scattering with the regular kink solution. The simulations reveal a rich variety of phenomena in the field dynamics, such as the formation of a kink-antikink pair, the generation of oscillons by the boundary perturbations, and the interaction between these objects and the boundary, which causes the emergence of boundary-induced resonant scatterings (for example, oscillon-boundary bound states and kink generation by oscillon-boundary collision) founded into complex fractal structures. Linear perturbation analysis was applied to interpret some aspects of the scattering process. We detected the presence of two shape modes near the boundary. The power spectral density of the scalar field at a fixed point leads to several frequency peaks. Most of them can be explained with some interesting insights for the interaction between the scattering products and the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scenario of a de Sitter universe living on an End-of-the-World brane. Motivated by the Swampland programme and in particular the Cobordism Conjecture, we consider a compact region of AdS$_5$ nucleating from nothing, with a dS$_4$ living on its boundary. We show that it can equivalently be interpreted as an up-tunnelling from AdS$_5$ with cosmological constant $\Lambda\to -\infty$, following Brown and Dahlen's proposal for 'nothing'. Their picture naively leads to the conclusion that the brane has infinite negative tension. But we show that it becomes finite and positive once we employ holographic renormalization, recovering the Bubble of Something where the domain wall becomes a boundary of spacetime. The same holds true in any number of dimensions and, moreover, at the level of metric perturbations. This provides motivation for alternative routes of obtaining cosmology from quantum gravity or string theory using domain walls, departing from conventional vacuum approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The particle with first-order dynamics proposed by Dunne, Jackiw and Trugenberger (DJT) to justify the ``Peierls substitution" is obtained by reduction from both of the planar two-parameter centrally extended Galilean and Carroll systems. In the latter case the extension parameters $\kappa_{exo}$ and $\kappa_{mag}$ generate non-commutativity of the coordinates resp. behave as an internal magnetic field. The position and momentum follow uncoupled anomalous Hall motions. Consistently with partial immobility, one of the Carroll boost generators is broken but the other remains a symmetry. Switching off $\kappa_{exo}$, the immobility of unextended Carroll particles is recovered. The Carroll system is dual to an uncharged anyon on the horizon of a black hole which exhibits the spin-Hall effect. Physical applications are shortly reviewed.</description>

Abstract: In these lecture notes for the Les Houches School on Quantum Geometry I give an introductory overview of non-perturbative aspects of topological string theory. After a short summary of the perturbative aspects, I first consider the non-perturbative sectors of the theory as unveiled by the theory of resurgence. I give a self-contained derivation of recent results on non-perturbative amplitudes, and I explain the conjecture relating the resurgent structure of the topological string to BPS invariants. In the second part of the lectures I introduce the topological string/spectral theory (TS/ST) correspondence, which provides a non-perturbative definition of topological string theory on toric Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of the spectral theory of quantum mirror curves</description>

Abstract: We investigate a gravitational model based on local Lorentz invariance and general coordinate invariance. The model incorporates classical scale invariance, which forbids dimensionful parameters, and the irreversible vierbein postulate, which enables continuous degenerate limits of the vierbein, both at a specific scale. Through the dynamics of the system, we demonstrate the simultaneous emergence of the Planck mass and a curved spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Transcendentality of Type II superstring amplitude at one-loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the four-graviton scattering amplitude in Type II superstring theory at one-loop up to seventh order in the low-energy expansion through the recently developed iterated integral formalism of Modular Graph Functions (MGFs). We propose a new assignment of transcendental weight to the numbers that appear in the amplitude, which leads to a violation of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, the machinery of the novel method allows us to propose a general form of the amplitude, which suggests that the expansion is expressible in terms of single-valued multiple zeta values and logarithmic derivatives of the Riemann zeta function at positive and negative odd integers.</description>

      <title>Something Anomalies can tell about SM and Gravity</title>

Abstract: This ia a review/research paper on anomalies applied to a bottom-up approach to standard model and gravity. It is divided in two parts. The first consists in a review proper of anomalies in quantum field theories. Anomalies are analyzed according to three different methods: a perturbative one based on Feynman diagram, a non-perturbative one relying on the Schwinger-DeWitt approach and, third, the one hinging on the Atiyah-Singer family's index theorem. The three methods are applied both to chiral gauge anomalies and trace anomalies. The fundamental distinction that our presentation leads to is between obstructive (O) and non-obstructive (NO) anomalies. The former are tied to the non-existence of fermion propagators, which fatally maim the corresponding theory. In the second part we apply this analysis to the SM and various of its extensions immersed in a gravitational background, and find that they all are plagued by a residual chiral trace anomaly. To completely eliminate all kind of dangerous anomalies in SM-like theories we propose a somewhat unconventional scheme, and exemplify it by means of an explicit model. The latter is a left-right symmetric model. We embed it in a Weyl geometry to render it conformal invariant. We then deal with some of its quantum aspects, in particular its even (NO) trace anomalies and the means to preserve its confomal invariance at the quantum level. We briefly review renormalization and unitarity in the framework of similar models discussed in the existing literature. Finally we present a possible (conjectural) application of the model to describe the junction between cosmology and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Volume, Polyakov Anomaly and Orbifold Riemann Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2310.17536, two of the authors studied the function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}} = S_{\boldsymbol{m}} - \pi \sum_{i=1}^n (m_i - \tfrac{1}{m_i}) \log \mathsf{h}_{i}$ for orbifold Riemann surfaces of signature $(g;m_1,...,m_{n_e};n_p)$ on the generalized Schottky space $\mathfrak{S}_{g,n}(\boldsymbol{m})$. In this paper, we prove the holographic duality between $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ and the renormalized hyperbolic volume $V_{\text{ren}}$ of the corresponding Schottky 3-orbifolds with lines of conical singularity that reach the conformal boundary. In case of the classical Liouville action on $\mathfrak{S}_{g}$ and $\mathfrak{S}_{g,n}(\boldsymbol{\infty})$, the holography principle was proved in arXiv:hep-th/0005106v2 and arXiv:1508.02102, respectively. Our result implies that $V_{\text{ren}}$ acts as K\"ahler potential for a particular combination of the Weil-Petersson and Takhtajan-Zograf metrics that appears in the local index theorem for orbifold Riemann surfaces arXiv:1701.00771. Moreover, we demonstrate that under the conformal transformations, the change of function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ is equivalent to the Polyakov anomaly, which indicates that the function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ is a consistent height function with a unique hyperbolic solution. Consequently, the associated renormalized hyperbolic volume $V_{\text{ren}}$ also admits a Polyakov anomaly formula. The method we used to establish this equivalence may provide an alternative approach to derive the renormalized Polyakov anomaly for Riemann surfaces with punctures (cusps), as described in arXiv:0909.0807.</description>

      <title>IR Bounds on Theories with Spontaneously-Broken Lorentz Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nature, some UV features of the dynamics are reflected in IR quantities. In fully relativistic theories, this connection can be probed through the analyticity properties of scattering amplitudes, allowing to understand which IR theories respect the UV assumptions of quantum field theory. The ensuing analyticity bounds can be usually rephrased as the absence of faster-than-light propagation for low-energy excitations. While it is interesting to understand these relations and their IR characterization for theories that have less idealized properties, it is also more difficult to derive analyticity bounds in these cases. For theories that spontaneously break Lorentz symmetry, recent progress was made by considering correlators of conserved currents and their analyticity properties. In this work, we focus on such theories and close the gap from the IR side, deriving bounds from the speed of propagation that are equivalent to the known analyticity bounds. Our bounds require that gapped excitations have a slower speed than gapless ones, at least for momenta that are low with respect to the mass gap. These results suggest a way to study the UV/IR connection in more complex theories.</description>

      <title>Quite Discrete for a fermion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Discrete Series representations of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ with half-integer scaling dimension $\Delta$. At the classical level, we show that these UIRs are realised in the space of mode solutions of spinor fields with imaginary mass parameters on a fixed two-dimensional de Sitter, dS$_{2}$, background. Upon such tuning of the mass, the field develops a fermionic shift symmetry that we characterise. We show that in the Euclidean section this manifests itself in the presence of zero-modes which preclude the definition of a Hadamard two-point function for these UIRs. We propose a Euclidean procedure to deal with the zero-modes, define a two-point function with the right singularity structure, and analyse its late-time behaviour. We end this note by proposing two interacting theories containing the fermionic discrete series in their spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Bonnet formula for the renormalized area of minimal submanifolds of Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the extrinsic $Q$-curvature admits a decomposition into the Pfaffian, a scalar conformal submanifold invariant, and a tangential divergence, we prove that the renormalized area of an even-dimensional minimal submanifold of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold can be expressed as a linear combination of its Euler characteristic and the integral of a scalar conformal submanifold invariant. We derive such a decomposition of the extrinsic $Q$-curvature in dimensions two and four, thereby recovering and generalizing results of Alexakis-Mazzeo and Tyrrell, respectively. We also conjecture such a decomposition for general natural submanifold scalars whose integral over compact submanifolds is conformally invariant, and verify our conjecture in dimensions two and four. Our results also apply to the area of a compact even-dimensional minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <title>Constraining Millicharged dark matter with Gravitational positivity bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational positivity bounds provide consistency conditions for effective field theories with gravity. They turn out to be phenomenologically useful by providing lower bounds in parameters of new physics beyond the Standard Models (BSM). In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that when the dark matter mass is lighter than the solar core temperature, most of the parameter region is excluded by combining gravitational positivity bounds and the stellar bounds.</description>

      <title>Relational dynamics and Page-Wootters formalism in group field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group field theory posits that spacetime is emergent and is hence defined without any background notion of space or time; dynamical questions are formulated in relational terms, in particular using (scalar) matter degrees of freedom as time. Unlike in canonical quantisation of gravitational systems, there is no obvious notion of coordinate transformations or constraints, and established quantisation methods cannot be directly applied. As a result, different canonical formalisms for group field theory have been discussed in the literature. We address these issues using a parametrised version of group field theory, in which all (geometry and matter) degrees of freedom evolve in a fiducial parameter. There is a constraint associated to the freedom of reparametrisation and the Dirac quantisation programme can be implemented. Using the "trinity of relational dynamics", we show that the resulting "clock-neutral" theory is entirely equivalent to a deparametrised canonical group field theory, interpreted in terms of the Page-Wootters formalism. Our results not only show that the deparametrised quantisation is fully covariant and can be seen as encoding the dynamics of joint quantum matter and geometry degrees of freedom, they also appear to be the first application of the Page-Wootters formalism directly to non-perturbative quantum gravity. We show extensions to a setting in which many independent gauge symmetries are introduced, which connects to the "multi-fingered time" idea in quantum gravity and provides a somewhat novel extension of the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>

      <title>String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Cardoso and Nat\'ario [6] constructed an exact solution of Einstein-scalar field equations that describes a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe. In fact, this solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7]. In this work we show how to further generalize these solutions in presence of rotation and various charges. More specifically, we describe the general charged rotating black holes with NUT charge and present some of their properties.</description>

Abstract: In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles, that is sensitive to a finite QCD vacuum angle $\theta$. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors, and estimate the proton and neutron electric dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>
