      <title>Deep operator network models for predicting post-burn contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burn injuries present a significant global health challenge. Among the most severe long-term consequences are contractures, which can lead to functional impairments and disfigurement. Understanding and predicting the evolution of post-burn wounds is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Traditional mathematical models, while accurate, are often computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their practical application. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, offer promising alternatives for accelerating these predictions. This study explores the use of a deep operator network (DeepONet), a type of neural operator, as a surrogate model for finite element simulations, aimed at predicting post-burn contraction across multiple wound shapes. A DeepONet was trained on three distinct initial wound shapes, with enhancement made to the architecture by incorporating initial wound shape information and applying sine augmentation to enforce boundary conditions. The performance of the trained DeepONet was evaluated on a test set including finite element simulations based on convex combinations of the three basic wound shapes. The model achieved an $R^2$ score of $0.99$, indicating strong predictive accuracy and generalization. Moreover, the model provided reliable predictions over an extended period of up to one year, with speedups of up to 128-fold on CPU and 235-fold on GPU, compared to the numerical model. These findings suggest that DeepONets can effectively serve as a surrogate for traditional finite element methods in simulating post-burn wound evolution, with potential applications in medical treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Subspace and auxiliary space preconditioners for high-order interior penalty discretizations in $H(\mathrm{div})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and analyze preconditioners for the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin discretization posed in the space $H(\mathrm{div})$. These discretizations are used as one component in exactly divergence-free pressure-robust discretizations for the Stokes problem. Three preconditioners are presently considered: a subspace correction preconditioner using vertex patches and the lowest-order $H^1$-conforming space as a coarse space, a fictitious space preconditioner using the degree-$p$ discontinuous Galerkin space, and an auxiliary space preconditioner using the degree-$(p-1)$ discontinuous Galerkin space and a block Jacobi smoother. On certain classes of meshes, the subspace and fictitious space preconditioners result in provably well-conditioned systems, independent of the mesh size $h$, polynomial degree $p$, and penalty parameter $\eta$. All three preconditioners are shown to be robust with respect to $h$ on general meshes, and numerical results indicate that the iteration counts grow only mildly with respect to $p$ in the general case. Numerical examples illustrate the convergence properties of the preconditioners applied to structured and unstructured meshes. These solvers are used to construct block-diagonal preconditioners for the Stokes problem, which result in uniform convergence when used with MINRES.</description>

      <title>Block subspace expansions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A\in\mathbb C^{n\times n}$ and let $\mathcal X\subset \mathbb C^n$ be an $A$-invariant subspace with $\dim \mathcal X=d\geq 1$, corresponding to exterior eigenvalues of $A$. Given an initial subspace $\mathcal V\subset \mathbb C^n$ with $\dim \mathcal V=r\geq d$, we search for expansions of $\mathcal V$ of the form $\mathcal V+A(\mathcal W_0)$, where $\mathcal W_0\subset \mathcal V$ is such that $\dim \mathcal W_0\leq d$ and such that the expanded subspace is closer to $\mathcal X$ than the initial $\mathcal V$. We show that there exist (theoretical) optimal choices of such $\mathcal W_0$, in the sense that $\theta_i(\mathcal X,\mathcal V+A(\mathcal W_0))\leq \theta_i(\mathcal V+A(\mathcal W))$ for every $\mathcal W\subset \mathcal V$ with $\dim \mathcal W\leq d$, where $\theta_i(\mathcal X,\mathcal T)$ denotes the $i$-th principal angle between $\mathcal X$ and $\mathcal T$, for $1\leq i\leq d\leq \dim \mathcal T$. We relate these optimal expansions to block Krylov subspaces generated by $A$ and $\mathcal V$. We also show that the corresponding iterative sequence of subspaces constructed in this way approximate $\mathcal X$ arbitrarily well, when $A$ is Hermitian and $\mathcal X$ is simple. We further introduce computable versions of this construction and compute several numerical examples that show the performance of the computable algorithms and test our convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation in 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, using a stabilized explicit $O(\Delta t)^2$ leapfrog finite difference scheme run backward in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with given hypothetical non smooth data at time $T &gt; 0 $that may not correspond to an actual solution at time $T$, a previously developed stabilized backward marching explicit leapfrog finite difference scheme is applied to these data, to find initial values at time $t = 0$ that can evolve into useful approximations to the given data at time $T$. That may not always be possible. Similar data assimilation problems, involving other dissipative systems, are of considerable interest in the geophysical sciences, and are commonly solved using computationally intensive methods based on neural networks informed by machine learning. Successful solution of ill-posed time-reversed Navier-Stokes equations is limited by uncertainty estimates, based on logarithmic convexity, that place limits on the value of $T &gt; 0$. In computational experiments involving satellite images of hurricanes and other meteorological phenomena, the present method is shown to produce successful solutions at values of $T &gt; 0$, that are several orders of magnitude larger than would be expected, based on the best-known uncertainty estimates. However, unsuccessful examples are also given. The present self-contained paper outlines the stabilizing technique, based on applying a compensating smoothing operator at each time step, and stresses the important differences between data assimilation, and backward recovery, in ill-posed time reversed problems for dissipative equations. While theorems are stated without proof, the reader is referred to a previous paper, on Navier-Stokes backward recovery, where these proofs can be found.</description>

      <title>Inf-sup stable space-time Local Discontinuous Galerkin method for the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a space-time Local Discontinuous Galerkin method for the approximation of the solution to parabolic problems. The method allows for very general discrete spaces and prismatic space-time meshes. Existence and uniqueness of a discrete solution are shown by means of an inf-sup condition, whose proof does not rely on polynomial inverse estimates. Moreover, for piecewise polynomial spaces satisfying an additional mild condition, we show a second inf-sup condition that provides an additional control of the time derivative of the discrete solution. We derive hp-a priori error bounds based on these inf-sup conditions, which we use to prove convergence rates for standard, tensor-product, and quasi-Trefftz polynomial spaces. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Fast-Decaying Polynomial Reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial reproduction plays a relevant role in deriving error estimates for various approximation schemes. Local reproduction in a quasi-uniform setting is a significant factor in the estimation of error and the assessment of stability but for some computationally relevant schemes, such as Rescaled Localized Radial Basis Functions (RL-RBF), it becomes a limitation. To facilitate the study of a greater variety of approximation methods in a unified and efficient manner, this work proposes a framework based on fast decaying polynomial reproduction: we do not restrict to compactly supported basis functions, but we allow the basis function decay to infinity as a function of the separation distance. Implementing fast decaying polynomial reproduction provides stable and convergent methods, that can be smooth when approximating by moving least squares otherwise very efficient in the case of linear programming problems. All the results presented in this paper concerning the rate of convergence, the Lebesgue constant, the smoothness of the approximant, and the compactness of the support have been verified numerically, even in the multivariate setting.</description>

      <title>A p-Multigrid Accelerated Nodal Spectral Element Method for Free-Surface Incompressible Navier-Stokes Model of Nonlinear Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral element model for general-purpose simulation of non-overturning nonlinear water waves using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) with a free surface. The numerical implementation of the spectral element method is inspired by the related work by Engsig-Karup et al. (2016) and is based on nodal Lagrange basis functions, mass matrix-based integration and gradient recovery using global $L^2$ projections. The resulting model leverages the high-order accurate -- possibly exponential -- error convergence and has support for geometric flexibility allowing for computationally efficient simulations of nonlinear wave propagation. An explicit fourth-order accurate Runge-Kutta scheme is employed for the temporal integration, and a mixed-stage numerical discretization is the basis for a pressure-velocity coupling that makes it possible to maintain high-order accuracy in both the temporal and spatial discretizations while preserving mass conservation. Furthermore, the numerical scheme is accelerated by solving the discrete Poisson problem using an iterative solver strategy based on a geometric $p$-multigrid method. This problem constitutes the main computational bottleneck in INSE models. It is shown through numerical experiments, that the model achieves spectral convergence in the velocity fields for highly nonlinear waves, and there is excellent agreement with experimental data for the simulation of the classical benchmark of harmonic wave generation over a submerged bar. The geometric $p$-multigrid solver demonstrates $O(n)$ computational scalability simulations, making it a suitable efficient solver strategy as a candidate for extensions to more complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A positive- and bound-preserving vectorial lattice Boltzmann method in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel positive kinetic scheme built on the efficient collide-and-stream algorithm of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to address hyperbolic conservation laws. We focus on the compressible Euler equations with strong discontinuities. Starting from the work of Jin and Xin [20] and then [4,8], we show how the LBM discretization procedure can yield both first- and second-order schemes, referred to as vectorial LBM. Noticing that the first-order scheme is convex preserving under a specific CFL constraint, we develop a blending strategy that preserves both the conservation and simplicity of the algorithm. This approach employs convex limiters, carefully designed to ensure either positivity (of the density and the internal energy) preservation (PP) or well-defined local maximum principles (LMP), while minimizing numerical dissipation. On challenging test cases involving strong discontinuities and near-vacuum regions, we demonstrate the scheme accuracy, robustness, and ability to capture sharp discontinuities with minimal numerical oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a full space-time numerical solution of the advection-diffusion equation using a continuous Galerkin finite element method on conforming meshes. The Galerkin/least-square method is employed to ensure stability of the discrete variational problem. In the full space-time formulation, time is considered another dimension, and the time derivative is interpreted as an additional advection term of the field variable. We derive a priori error estimates and illustrate spatio-temporal convergence with several numerical examples. We also derive a posteriori error estimates, which coupled with adaptive space-time mesh refinement provide efficient and accurate solutions. The accuracy of the space-time solutions is illustrated against analytical solutions as well as against numerical solutions using a conventional time-marching algorithm.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a space-time continuous-Galerkin finite element method for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. To ensure stability of the discrete variational problem, we apply ideas from the variational multi-scale method. The finite element problem is posed on the ``full" space-time domain, considering time as another dimension. We provide a rigorous analysis of the stability and convergence of the stabilized formulation. And finally, we apply this method on two benchmark problems in computational fluid dynamics, namely, lid-driven cavity flow and flow past a circular cylinder. We validate the current method with existing results from literature and show that very large space-time blocks can be solved using our approach.</description>

      <title>Approximating maps into manifolds with lower curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many interesting functions arising in applications map into Riemannian manifolds. We present an algorithm, using the manifold exponential and logarithm, for approximating such functions. Our approach extends approximation techniques for functions into linear spaces in such a way that we can upper bound the forward error in terms of a lower bound on the manifold's sectional curvature. Furthermore, when the sectional curvature is nonnegative, such as for compact Lie groups, the error is guaranteed to not be worse than in the linear case.
  We implement the algorithm in a Julia package ManiFactor.jl and apply it to two example problems.</description>

      <title>Irrational-window-filter projection method and application to quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger eigenproblems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, the irrational-window-filter projection method (IWFPM), for quasiperiodic systems with concentrated spectral point distribution. Based on the projection method (PM), IWFPM filters out dominant spectral points by defining an irrational window and uses a corresponding index-shift transform to make the FFT available. The error analysis on the function approximation level is also given. We apply IWFPM to 1D, 2D, and 3D quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger eigenproblems (QSEs) to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. IWFPM exhibits a significant computational advantage over PM for both extended and localized quantum states. More importantly, by using IWFPM, the existence of Anderson localization in 2D and 3D QSEs is numerically verified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trefftz schemes are high-order Galerkin methods whose discrete spaces are made of elementwise exact solutions of the underlying PDE. Trefftz basis functions can be easily computed for many PDEs that are linear, homogeneous, and have piecewise-constant coefficients. However, if the equation has variable coefficients, exact solutions are generally unavailable. Quasi-Trefftz methods overcome this limitation relying on elementwise "approximate solutions" of the PDE, in the sense of Taylor polynomials.
  We define polynomial quasi-Trefftz spaces for general linear PDEs with smooth coefficients and source term, describe their approximation properties and, under a non-degeneracy condition, provide a simple algorithm to compute a basis. We then focus on a quasi-Trefftz DG method for variable-coefficient elliptic diffusion-advection-reaction problems, showing stability and high-order convergence of the scheme. The main advantage over standard DG schemes is the higher accuracy for comparable numbers of degrees of freedom. For non-homogeneous problems with piecewise-smooth source term we propose to construct a local quasi-Trefftz particular solution and then solve for the difference. Numerical experiments in 2 and 3 space dimensions show the excellent properties of the method both in diffusion-dominated and advection-dominated problems.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann framework for multiphase flows by Eulerian-Eulerian Navier-Stokes equations</title>

Abstract: Although Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is relatively straightforward, it demands a well-crafted framework to handle the complex partial differential equations involved in multiphase flow simulations. For the first time to our knowledge, this work proposes a novel LBM framework for solving Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow equations without any finite-difference correction. The proposed methodology and all reported LBM formulas can be already applied to any dimension. This opens a promising venue for simulating multiphase flows on large High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and on novel parallel hardware. This LBM framework consists of six coupled LBM schemes - running on the same lattice - ensuring an efficient implementation in large codes with minimum effort. The preliminary numeral results agree in an excellent way with the a reference numerical solution obtained by a traditional finite difference solver.</description>

      <title>Huber-energy measure quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a measure quantization procedure i.e., an algorithm which finds the best approximation of a target probability law (and more generally signed finite variation measure) by a sum of $Q$ Dirac masses ($Q$ being the quantization parameter). The procedure is implemented by minimizing the statistical distance between the original measure and its quantized version; the distance is built from a negative definite kernel and, if necessary, can be computed on the fly and feed to a stochastic optimization algorithm (such as SGD, Adam, ...). We investigate theoretically the fundamental questions of existence of the optimal measure quantizer and identify what are the required kernel properties that guarantee suitable behavior. We propose two best linear unbiased (BLUE) estimators for the squared statistical distance and use them in an unbiased procedure, called HEMQ, to find the optimal quantization. We test HEMQ on several databases: multi-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, Wiener space cubature, Italian wine cultivars and the MNIST image database. The results indicate that the HEMQ algorithm is robust and versatile and, for the class of Huber-energy kernels, matches the expected intuitive behavior.</description>

      <title>Deep Quadratic Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel computational procedure for quadratic hedging in high-dimensional incomplete markets, covering mean-variance hedging and local risk minimization. Starting from the observation that both quadratic approaches can be treated from the point of view of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), we (recursively) apply a deep learning-based BSDE solver to compute the entire optimal hedging strategies paths. This allows us to overcome the curse of dimensionality, extending the scope of applicability of quadratic hedging in high dimension. We test our approach with a classic Heston model and with a multiasset and multifactor generalization thereof, showing that this leads to high levels of accuracy.</description>
