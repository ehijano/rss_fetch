      <title>Design and Evaluation of Whole-Page Experience Optimization for E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce Search Results Pages (SRPs) are evolving from linear lists to complex, non-linear layouts, rendering traditional position-biased ranking models insufficient. Moreover, existing optimization frameworks typically maximize short-term signals (e.g., clicks, same-day revenue) because long-term satisfaction metrics (e.g., expected two-week revenue) involve delayed feedback and challenging long-horizon credit attribution. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Whole-Page Experience Optimization Framework. Unlike traditional list-wise rankers, our approach explicitly models the interplay between item relevance, 2D positional layout, and visual elements. We use a causal framework to develop metrics for measuring long-term user satisfaction based on quasi-experimental data. We validate our approach through industry-scale A/B testing, where the model demonstrated a 1.86% improvement in brand relevance (our primary customer experience metric) while simultaneously achieving a statistically significant revenue uplift of +0.05%</description>

      <title>Col-Bandit: Zero-Shot Query-Time Pruning for Late-Interaction Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-vector late-interaction retrievers such as ColBERT achieve state-of-the-art retrieval quality, but their query-time cost is dominated by exhaustively computing token-level MaxSim interactions for every candidate document. While approximating late interaction with single-vector representations reduces cost, it often incurs substantial accuracy loss. We introduce Col-Bandit, a query-time pruning algorithm that reduces this computational burden by casting reranking as a finite-population Top-$K$ identification problem. Col-Bandit maintains uncertainty-aware bounds over partially observed document scores and adaptively reveals only the (document, query token) MaxSim entries needed to determine the top results under statistical decision bounds with a tunable relaxation. Unlike coarse-grained approaches that prune entire documents or tokens offline, Col-Bandit sparsifies the interaction matrix on the fly. It operates as a zero-shot, drop-in layer over standard multi-vector systems, requiring no index modifications, offline preprocessing, or model retraining. Experiments on textual (BEIR) and multimodal (REAL-MM-RAG) benchmarks show that Col-Bandit preserves ranking fidelity while reducing MaxSim FLOPs by up to 5$\times$, indicating that dense late-interaction scoring contains substantial redundancy that can be identified and pruned efficiently at query time.</description>

      <title>Efficiency Optimizations for Superblock-based Sparse Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned sparse retrieval (LSR) is a popular method for first-stage retrieval because it combines the semantic matching of language models with efficient CPU-friendly algorithms. Previous work aggregates blocks into "superblocks" to quickly skip the visitation of blocks during query processing by using an advanced pruning heuristic. This paper proposes a simple and effective superblock pruning scheme that reduces the overhead of superblock score computation while preserving competitive relevance. It combines this scheme with a compact index structure and a robust zero-shot configuration that is effective across LSR models and multiple datasets. This paper provides an analytical justification and evaluation on the MS MARCO and BEIR datasets, demonstrating that the proposed scheme can be a strong alternative for efficient sparse retrieval.</description>

      <title>ALPBench: A Benchmark for Attribution-level Long-term Personal Behavior Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have highlighted their potential for personalized recommendation, where accurately capturing user preferences remains a key challenge. Leveraging their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs offer new opportunities for modeling long-term user behavior. To systematically evaluate this, we introduce ALPBench, a Benchmark for Attribution-level Long-term Personal Behavior Understanding. Unlike item-focused benchmarks, ALPBench predicts user-interested attribute combinations, enabling ground-truth evaluation even for newly introduced items. It models preferences from long-term historical behaviors rather than users' explicitly expressed requests, better reflecting enduring interests. User histories are represented as natural language sequences, allowing interpretable, reasoning-based personalization. ALPBench enables fine-grained evaluation of personalization by focusing on the prediction of attribute combinations task that remains highly challenging for current LLMs due to the need to capture complex interactions among multiple attributes and reason over long-term user behavior sequences.</description>

      <title>PAMAS: Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent System with Perspective Aggregation for Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation on social media poses a critical threat to information credibility, as its diverse and context-dependent nature complicates detection. Large language model-empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) present a promising paradigm that enables cooperative reasoning and collective intelligence to combat this threat. However, conventional MAS suffer from an information-drowning problem, where abundant truthful content overwhelms sparse and weak deceptive cues. With full input access, agents tend to focus on dominant patterns, and inter-agent communication further amplifies this bias. To tackle this issue, we propose PAMAS, a multi-agent framework with perspective aggregation, which employs hierarchical, perspective-aware aggregation to highlight anomaly cues and alleviate information drowning. PAMAS organizes agents into three roles: Auditors, Coordinators, and a Decision-Maker. Auditors capture anomaly cues from specialized feature subsets; Coordinators aggregate their perspectives to enhance coverage while maintaining diversity; and the Decision-Maker, equipped with evolving memory and full contextual access, synthesizes all subordinate insights to produce the final judgment. Furthermore, to improve efficiency in multi-agent collaboration, PAMAS incorporates self-adaptive mechanisms for dynamic topology optimization and routing-based inference, enhancing both efficiency and scalability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PAMAS achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and trustworthy way for misinformation detection.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Aware End-to-End Embedding for Streaming Numerical Features in Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores effective numerical feature embedding for Click-Through Rate prediction in streaming environments. Conventional static binning methods rely on offline statistics of numerical distributions; however, this inherently two-stage process often triggers semantic drift during bin boundary updates. While neural embedding methods enable end-to-end learning, they often discard explicit distributional information. Integrating such information end-to-end is challenging because streaming features often violate the i.i.d. assumption, precluding unbiased estimation of the population distribution via the expectation of order statistics. Furthermore, the critical context dependency of numerical distributions is often neglected. To this end, we propose DAES, an end-to-end framework designed to tackle numerical feature embedding in streaming training scenarios by integrating distributional information with an adaptive modulation mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an efficient reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation method and two field-aware distribution modulation strategies to capture streaming distributions and field-dependent semantics. DAES significantly outperforms existing approaches as demonstrated by extensive offline and online experiments and has been fully deployed on a leading short-video platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users.</description>

      <title>To Search or Not to Search: Aligning the Decision Boundary of Deep Search Agents via Causal Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep search agents, which autonomously iterate through multi-turn web-based reasoning, represent a promising paradigm for complex information-seeking tasks. However, current agents suffer from critical inefficiency: they conduct excessive searches as they cannot accurately judge when to stop searching and start answering. This stems from outcome-centric training that prioritize final results over the search process itself. We identify the root cause as misaligned decision boundaries, the threshold determining when accumulated information suffices to answer. This causes over-search (redundant searching despite sufficient knowledge) and under-search (premature termination yielding incorrect answers). To address these errors, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising two key components. First, we introduce causal intervention-based diagnosis that identifies boundary errors by comparing factual and counterfactual trajectories at each decision point. Second, we develop Decision Boundary Alignment for Deep Search agents (DAS), which constructs preference datasets from causal feedback and aligns policies via preference optimization. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that decision boundary errors are pervasive across state-of-the-art agents. Our DAS method effectively calibrates these boundaries, mitigating both over-search and under-search to achieve substantial gains in accuracy and efficiency. Our code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/WWW2026_DAS.</description>

      <title>Learning to Select: Query-Aware Adaptive Dimension Selection for Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrieval represents queries and docu-002 ments as high-dimensional embeddings, but003 these representations can be redundant at the004 query level: for a given information need, only005 a subset of dimensions is consistently help-006 ful for ranking. Prior work addresses this via007 pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) based dimen-008 sion importance estimation, which can produce009 query-aware masks without labeled data but010 often relies on noisy pseudo signals and heuris-011 tic test-time procedures. In contrast, super-012 vised adapter methods leverage relevance labels013 to improve embedding quality, yet they learn014 global transformations shared across queries015 and do not explicitly model query-aware di-016 mension importance. We propose a Query-017 Aware Adaptive Dimension Selection frame-018 work that learns to predict per-dimension im-019 portance directly from query embedding. We020 first construct oracle dimension importance dis-021 tributions over embedding dimensions using022 supervised relevance labels, and then train a023 predictor to map a query embedding to these024 label-distilled importance scores. At inference,025 the predictor selects a query-aware subset of026 dimensions for similarity computation based027 solely on the query embedding, without pseudo-028 relevance feedback. Experiments across multi-029 ple dense retrievers and benchmarks show that030 our learned dimension selector improves re-031 trieval effectiveness over the full-dimensional032 baseline as well as PRF-based masking and033 supervised adapter baselines.</description>

      <title>SCASRec: A Self-Correcting and Auto-Stopping Model for Generative Route List Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Route recommendation systems commonly adopt a multi-stage pipeline involving fine-ranking and re-ranking to produce high-quality ordered recommendations. However, this paradigm faces three critical limitations. First, there is a misalignment between offline training objectives and online metrics. Offline gains do not necessarily translate to online improvements. Actual performance must be validated through A/B testing, which may potentially compromise the user experience. Second, redundancy elimination relies on rigid, handcrafted rules that lack adaptability to the high variance in user intent and the unstructured complexity of real-world scenarios. Third, the strict separation between fine-ranking and re-ranking stages leads to sub-optimal performance. Since each module is optimized in isolation, the fine-ranking stage remains oblivious to the list-level objectives (e.g., diversity) targeted by the re-ranker, thereby preventing the system from achieving a jointly optimized global optimum. To overcome these intertwined challenges, we propose \textbf{SCASRec} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}orrecting and \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{S}topping \textbf{Rec}ommendation), a unified generative framework that integrates ranking and redundancy elimination into a single end-to-end process. SCASRec introduces a stepwise corrective reward (SCR) to guide list-wise refinement by focusing on hard samples, and employs a learnable End-of-Recommendation (EOR) token to terminate generation adaptively when no further improvement is expected. Experiments on two large-scale, open-sourced route recommendation datasets demonstrate that SCASRec establishes an SOTA in offline and online settings. SCASRec has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Beyond Exposure: Optimizing Ranking Fairness with Non-linear Time-Income Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking is central to information distribution in web search and recommendation. Nowadays, in ranking optimization, the fairness to item providers is viewed as a crucial factor alongside ranking relevance for users. There are currently numerous concepts of fairness and one widely recognized fairness concept is Exposure Fairness. However, it relies primarily on exposure determined solely by position, overlooking other factors that significantly influence income, such as time. To address this limitation, we propose to study ranking fairness when the provider utility is influenced by other contextual factors and is neither equal to nor proportional to item exposure. We give a formal definition of Income Fairness and develop a corresponding measurement metric. Simulated experiments show that existing-exposure-fairness-based ranking algorithms fail to optimize the proposed income fairness. Therefore, we propose the Dynamic-Income-Derivative-aware Ranking Fairness algorithm, which, based on the marginal income gain at the present timestep, uses Taylor-expansion-based gradients to simultaneously optimize effectiveness and income fairness. In both offline and online settings with diverse time-income functions, DIDRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>AesRec: A Dataset for Aesthetics-Aligned Clothing Outfit Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clothing recommendation extends beyond merely generating personalized outfits; it serves as a crucial medium for aesthetic guidance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on user-item-outfit interaction behaviors while overlooking explicit representations of clothing aesthetics. To bridge this gap, we present the AesRec benchmark dataset featuring systematic quantitative aesthetic annotations, thereby enabling the development of aesthetics-aligned recommendation systems. Grounded in professional apparel quality standards and fashion aesthetic principles, we define a multidimensional set of indicators. At the item level, six dimensions are independently assessed: silhouette, chromaticity, materiality, craftsmanship, wearability, and item-level impression. Transitioning to the outfit level, the evaluation retains the first five core attributes while introducing stylistic synergy, visual harmony, and outfit-level impression as distinct metrics to capture the collective aesthetic impact. Given the increasing human-like proficiency of Vision-Language Models in multimodal understanding and interaction, we leverage them for large-scale aesthetic scoring. We conduct rigorous human-machine consistency validation on a fashion dataset, confirming the reliability of the generated ratings. Experimental results based on AesRec further demonstrate that integrating quantified aesthetic information into clothing recommendation models can provide aesthetic guidance for users while fulfilling their personalized requirements.</description>

      <title>RankSteer: Activation Steering for Pointwise LLM Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance as zero-shot rankers, yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt formulation, particularly role-play instructions. Prior analyses suggest that role-related signals are encoded along activation channels that are largely separate from query-document representations, raising the possibility of steering ranking behavior directly at the activation level rather than through brittle prompt engineering. In this work, we propose RankSteer, a post-hoc activation steering framework for zero-shot pointwise LLM ranking. We characterize ranking behavior through three disentangled and steerable directions in representation space: a \textbf{decision direction} that maps hidden states to relevance scores, an \textbf{evidence direction} that captures relevance signals not directly exploited by the decision head, and a \textbf{role direction} that modulates model behavior without injecting relevance information. Using projection-based interventions at inference time, RankSteer jointly controls these directions to calibrate ranking behavior without modifying model weights or introducing explicit cross-document comparisons. Experiments on TREC DL 20 and multiple BEIR benchmarks show that RankSteer consistently improves ranking quality using only a small number of anchor queries, demonstrating that substantial ranking capacity remains under-utilized in pointwise LLM rankers. We further provide a geometric analysis revealing that steering improves ranking by stabilizing ranking geometry and reducing dispersion, offering new insight into how LLMs internally represent and calibrate relevance judgments.</description>

      <title>Failure is Feedback: History-Aware Backtracking for Agentic Traversal in Multimodal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-domain multimodal document retrieval aims to retrieve specific components (paragraphs, tables, or images) from large and interconnected document corpora. Existing graph-based retrieval approaches typically rely on a uniform similarity metric that overlooks hop-specific semantics, and their rigid pre-defined plans hinder dynamic error correction. These limitations suggest that a retriever should adapt its reasoning to the evolving context and recover intelligently from dead ends. To address these needs, we propose Failure is Feedback (FiF), which casts subgraph retrieval as a sequential decision process and introduces two key innovations. (i) We introduce a history-aware backtracking mechanism; unlike standard backtracking that simply reverts the state, our approach piggybacks on the context of failed traversals, leveraging insights from previous failures. (ii) We implement an economically-rational agentic workflow. Unlike conventional agents with static strategies, our orchestrator employs a cost-aware traversal method to dynamically manage the trade-off between retrieval accuracy and inference costs, escalating to intensive LLM-based reasoning only when the prior failure justifies the additional computational investment. Extensive experiments show that FiF achieves state-of-the-art retrieval on the benchmarks of MultimodalQA, MMCoQA and WebQA.</description>

      <title>Tutorial on Reasoning for IR &amp; IR for Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval has long focused on ranking documents by semantic relatedness. Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies.</description>

      <title>Bringing Reasoning to Generative Recommendation Through the Lens of Cascaded Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has become a promising end-to-end approach with high FLOPS utilization for resource-efficient recommendation. Despite the effectiveness, we show that current GR models suffer from a critical \textbf{bias amplification} issue, where token-level bias escalates as token generation progresses, ultimately limiting the recommendation diversity and hurting the user experience. By comparing against the key factor behind the success of traditional multi-stage pipelines, we reveal two limitations in GR that can amplify the bias: homogeneous reliance on the encoded history, and fixed computational budgets that prevent deeper user preference understanding.
  To combat the bias amplification issue, it is crucial for GR to 1) incorporate more heterogeneous information, and 2) allocate greater computational resources at each token generation step. To this end, we propose CARE, a simple yet effective cascaded reasoning framework for debiased GR. To incorporate heterogeneous information, we introduce a progressive history encoding mechanism, which progressively incorporates increasingly fine-grained history information as the generation process advances. To allocate more computations, we propose a query-anchored reasoning mechanism, which seeks to perform a deeper understanding of historical information through parallel reasoning steps. We instantiate CARE on three GR backbones. Empirical results on four datasets show the superiority of CARE in recommendation accuracy, diversity, efficiency, and promising scalability. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Linxyhaha/CARE.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Generative Recommendation for Fusing Semantic and Collaborative Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems rank relevant items by modeling a user's interaction history and computing the inner product between the resulting user representation and stored item embeddings. To avoid the significant memory overhead of storing large item sets, the generative recommendation paradigm instead models each item as a series of discrete semantic codes. Here, the next item is predicted by an autoregressive model that generates the code sequence corresponding to the predicted item. However, despite promising ranking capabilities on small datasets, these methods have yet to surpass traditional sequential recommenders on large item sets, limiting their adoption in the very scenarios they were designed to address. To resolve this, we propose MSCGRec, a Multimodal Semantic and Collaborative Generative Recommender. MSCGRec incorporates multiple semantic modalities and introduces a novel self-supervised quantization learning approach for images based on the DINO framework. Additionally, MSCGRec fuses collaborative and semantic signals by extracting collaborative features from sequential recommenders and treating them as a separate modality. Finally, we propose constrained sequence learning that restricts the large output space during training to the set of permissible tokens. We empirically demonstrate on three large real-world datasets that MSCGRec outperforms both sequential and generative recommendation baselines and provide an extensive ablation study to validate the impact of each component.</description>

      <title>Measuring Individual User Fairness with User Similarity and Effectiveness Disparity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual user fairness is commonly understood as treating similar users similarly. In Recommender Systems (RSs), several evaluation measures exist for quantifying individual user fairness. These measures evaluate fairness via either: (i) the disparity in RS effectiveness scores regardless of user similarity, or (ii) the disparity in items recommended to similar users regardless of item relevance. Both disparity in recommendation effectiveness and user similarity are very important in fairness, yet no existing individual user fairness measure simultaneously accounts for both. In brief, current user fairness evaluation measures implement a largely incomplete definition of fairness. To fill this gap, we present Pairwise User unFairness (PUF), a novel evaluation measure of individual user fairness that considers both effectiveness disparity and user similarity. PUF is the only measure that can express this important distinction. We empirically validate that PUF does this consistently across 4 datasets and 7 rankers, and robustly when varying user similarity or effectiveness. In contrast, all other measures are either almost insensitive to effectiveness disparity or completely insensitive to user similarity. We contribute the first RS evaluation measure to reliably capture both user similarity and effectiveness in individual user fairness.

      <title>Uncertainty and Fairness Awareness in LLM-Based Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable powerful zero-shot recommendations by leveraging broad contextual knowledge, yet predictive uncertainty and embedded biases threaten reliability and fairness. This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.</description>

      <title>WideSeek: Advancing Wide Research via Multi-Agent Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search intelligence is evolving from Deep Research to Wide Research, a paradigm essential for retrieving and synthesizing comprehensive information under complex constraints in parallel. However, progress in this field is impeded by the lack of dedicated benchmarks and optimization methodologies for search breadth. To address these challenges, we take a deep dive into Wide Research from two perspectives: Data Pipeline and Agent Optimization. First, we produce WideSeekBench, a General Broad Information Seeking (GBIS) benchmark constructed via a rigorous multi-phase data pipeline to ensure diversity across the target information volume, logical constraints, and domains. Second, we introduce WideSeek, a dynamic hierarchical multi-agent architecture that can autonomously fork parallel sub-agents based on task requirements. Furthermore, we design a unified training framework that linearizes multi-agent trajectories and optimizes the system using end-to-end RL. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WideSeek and multi-agent RL, highlighting that scaling the number of agents is a promising direction for advancing the Wide Research paradigm.</description>

      <title>From Speech-to-Spatial: Grounding Utterances on A Live Shared View with Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Speech-to-Spatial, a referent disambiguation framework that converts verbal remote-assistance instructions into spatially grounded AR guidance. Unlike prior systems that rely on additional cues (e.g., gesture, gaze) or manual expert annotations, Speech-to-Spatial infers the intended target solely from spoken references (speech input). Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance ("a bit more to the right", "now, stop.") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Speechto-Spatial improves task efficiency, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability compared to a conventional voice-only baseline, transforming disembodied verbal instruction into visually explainable, actionable guidance on a live shared view.</description>

      <title>Ontology-to-tools compilation for executable semantic constraint enforcement in LLM agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling Output Rankings in Generative Engines for LLM-based Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way customers search for and choose products is changing with the rise of large language models (LLMs). LLM-based search, or generative engines, provides direct product recommendations to users, rather than traditional online search results that require users to explore options themselves. However, these recommendations are strongly influenced by the initial retrieval order of LLMs, which disadvantages small businesses and independent creators by limiting their visibility.
  In this work, we propose CORE, an optimization method that \textbf{C}ontrols \textbf{O}utput \textbf{R}ankings in g\textbf{E}nerative Engines for LLM-based search. Since the LLM's interactions with the search engine are black-box, CORE targets the content returned by search engines as the primary means of influencing output rankings. Specifically, CORE optimizes retrieved content by appending strategically designed optimization content to steer the ranking of outputs. We introduce three types of optimization content: string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based, demonstrating their effectiveness in shaping output rankings. To evaluate CORE in realistic settings, we introduce ProductBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 product categories and 200 products per category, where each product is associated with its top-10 recommendations collected from Amazon's search interface.
  Extensive experiments on four LLMs with search capabilities (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, Claude-4, and Grok-3) demonstrate that CORE achieves an average Promotion Success Rate of \textbf{91.4\% @Top-5}, \textbf{86.6\% @Top-3}, and \textbf{80.3\% @Top-1}, across 15 product categories, outperforming existing ranking manipulation methods while preserving the fluency of optimized content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM factuality, yet design guidance remains English-centric, limiting insights for morphologically rich languages like Turkish. We address this by constructing a comprehensive Turkish RAG dataset derived from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, comprising question-answer pairs and relevant passage chunks. We benchmark seven stages of the RAG pipeline, from query transformation and reranking to answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning. Our results show that complex methods like HyDE maximize accuracy (85%) that is considerably higher than the baseline (78.70%). Also a Pareto-optimal configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking and Context Augmentation achieves comparable performance (84.60%) with much lower cost. We further demonstrate that over-stacking generative modules can degrade performance by distorting morphological cues, whereas simple query clarification with robust reranking offers an effective solution.</description>

      <title>Towards Full Candidate Interaction: A Comprehensive Comparison Network for Better Route Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Route Recommendation (RR) is a core task in route planning within online navigation applications, aiming to recommend the optimal route among candidate routes to users. Industrially, RR adopts the two-stage recall-and-rank framework instead of traditional route planning algorithms primarily for computational efficiency. However, RR fundamentally differs from traditional recommendation systems that follow this paradigm. First, a primary challenge is that route items cannot be assigned unique identifiers. Additionally, RR fundamentally differs from traditional recommendation systems in its approach to feature interaction. These differences render conventional recommendation approaches inadequate for route recommendation scenarios, necessitating specialized methods that can effectively handle route-specific challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Comprehensive Comparison Network (CCN) for route recommendation. CCN constructs comparative features by comparing non-overlapping segments between route pairs, enabling difference learning without the infinite scalability issues of ID embeddings. Furthermore, CCN employs a specially designed Comprehensive Comparison Block (CCB) that differs from previous item attention methods to achieve effective cross-interaction between routes using comparison-level features. Moreover, we develop an interpretable Pair Scoring Network (PSN) for route recommendation and introduce a more comprehensive route recommendation dataset to advance research in this field. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and CCN has been successfully deployed in AMAP for over a year, demonstrating its value in route recommendation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating High-Resolution Piano Sustain Pedal Depth Estimation with Musically Informed Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluation for continuous piano pedal depth estimation tasks remains incomplete when relying only on conventional frame-level metrics, which overlook musically important features such as direction-change boundaries and pedal curve contours. To provide more interpretable and musically meaningful insights, we propose an evaluation framework that augments standard frame-level metrics with an action-level assessment measuring direction and timing using segments of press/hold/release states and a gesture-level analysis that evaluates contour similarity of each press-release cycle. We apply this framework to compare an audio-only baseline with two variants: one incorporating symbolic information from MIDI, and another trained in a binary-valued setting, all within a unified architecture. Results show that the MIDI-informed model significantly outperforms the others at action and gesture levels, despite modest frame-level gains. These findings demonstrate that our framework captures musically relevant improvements indiscernible by traditional metrics, offering a more practical and effective approach to evaluating pedal depth estimation models.</description>

      <title>BlossomRec: Block-level Fused Sparse Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer structures have been widely used in sequential recommender systems (SRS). However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/WWW2026_BlossomRec.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Ranking: Bridging the Gap Between Dual and Cross Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a shift toward generative approaches to retrieval and ranking, aiming to supersede classical Dual Encoders (DEs) and Cross Encoders (CEs). A prominent paradigm is pointwise Autoregressive Ranking (ARR), where an LLM generates document identifiers (docIDs) token-by-token to enable ranking via beam search. ARR offers the promise of superior expressivity compared to DEs while avoiding the prohibitive computational cost of CEs. However, a formal theoretical foundation for this expressive power has been missing. Moreover, the standard next-token prediction loss is rank-agnostic and inappropriate for finetuning an LLM for ranking tasks.
  In this paper, we first prove that the expressive capacity of ARR is strictly superior to DEs. While a DE requires an embedding dimension that grows linearly with corpus size to achieve arbitrary rankings, ARR can solve it with a constant hidden dimension. We then propose SToICaL (Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss), a generalized rank-aware training loss for LLM finetuning. By using item-level reweighting and prefix-tree marginalization, we distribute probability mass over valid docID tokens based on their ground-truth relevance. Experiments on WordNet and ESCI datasets verify that our loss suppresses invalid docID generations and significantly improves ranking metrics beyond top-1 retrieval.</description>

      <title>Agentic Search in the Wild: Intents and Trajectory Dynamics from 14M+ Real Search Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-powered search agents are increasingly being used for multi-step information seeking tasks, yet the IR community lacks empirical understanding of how agentic search sessions unfold and how retrieved evidence is used. This paper presents a large-scale log analysis of agentic search based on 14.44M search requests (3.97M sessions) collected from DeepResearchGym, i.e. an open-source search API accessed by external agentic clients. We sessionize the logs, assign session-level intents and step-wise query-reformulation labels using LLM-based annotation, and propose Context-driven Term Adoption Rate (CTAR) to quantify whether newly introduced query terms are traceable to previously retrieved evidence. Our analyses reveal distinctive behavioral patterns. First, over 90% of multi-turn sessions contain at most ten steps, and 89% of inter-step intervals fall under one minute. Second, behavior varies by intent. Fact-seeking sessions exhibit high repetition that increases over time, while sessions requiring reasoning sustain broader exploration. Third, agents reuse evidence across steps. On average, 54% of newly introduced query terms appear in the accumulated evidence context, with contributions from earlier steps beyond the most recent retrieval. The findings suggest that agentic search may benefit from repetition-aware early stopping, intent-adaptive retrieval budgets, and explicit cross-step context tracking. We plan to release the anonymized logs to support future research.</description>

      <title>RobustExplain: Evaluating Robustness of LLM-Based Explanation Agents for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Orchestrators: Constraint-Compliant Multi-Agent Optimization for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Heterogeneous Experts: A Scalable MoE Framework with Anisotropy-Preserving Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cross-border e-commerce, search relevance modeling faces the dual challenge of extreme linguistic diversity and fine-grained semantic nuances. Existing approaches typically rely on scaling up a single monolithic Large Language Model (LLM). However, our empirical analysis reveals that single models suffer from uneven capability distributions across regions. For example, excelling in English while underperforming in specific Southeast Asian languages. In this work, we shift the paradigm from scaling a single model to orchestrating heterogeneous experts. We propose a scalable Coarse-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that leverages the inherent complementarity of distinct open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen, Gemma) without expensive pre-training. Unlike standard token-level MoE, our framework dynamically routes entire queries to specialized experts and, crucially, employs an Information-Preserving Concatenation Fusion strategy. We theoretically posit that preserving the distinct embedding manifolds of heterogeneous experts-rather than compressing them via weighted averaging-is essential for capturing complex relevance signals in a multi-model latent space. On datasets spanning six Southeast Asian markets, our MoE improves AUC by 0.72 percentage points over a dense baseline with the same active parameters. Meanwhile, the optimized pipeline achieves 13.72 queries per second (QPS), a 9% throughput improvement.</description>

      <title>Unifying Ranking and Generation in Query Auto-Completion via Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Multi-Objective Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query Auto-Completion (QAC) suggests query completions as users type, helping them articulate intent and reach results more efficiently. Existing approaches face fundamental challenges: traditional retrieve-and-rank pipelines have limited long-tail coverage and require extensive feature engineering, while recent generative methods suffer from hallucination and safety risks. We present a unified framework that reformulates QAC as end-to-end list generation through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-objective Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) reformulating QAC as end-to-end list generation with multi-objective optimization; (2) defining and deploying a suite of rule-based, model-based, and LLM-as-judge verifiers for QAC, and using them in a comprehensive methodology that combines RAG, multi-objective DPO, and iterative critique-revision for high-quality synthetic data; (3) a hybrid serving architecture enabling efficient production deployment under strict latency constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale commercial search platform demonstrates substantial improvements: offline metrics show gains across all dimensions, human evaluation yields +0.40 to +0.69 preference scores, and a controlled online experiment achieves 5.44\% reduction in keystrokes and 3.46\% increase in suggestion adoption, validating that unified generation with RAG and multi-objective alignment provides an effective solution for production QAC. This work represents a paradigm shift to end-to-end generation powered by large language models, RAG, and multi-objective alignment, establishing a production-validated framework that can benefit the broader search and recommendation industry.</description>

      <title>GRAB: An LLM-Inspired Sequence-First Click-Through Rate Prediction Modeling Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) face increasing bottlenecks in performance and efficiency, often struggling with generalization and long-sequence modeling. Inspired by the scaling success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose Generative Ranking for Ads at Baidu (GRAB), an end-to-end generative framework for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. GRAB integrates a novel Causal Action-aware Multi-channel Attention (CamA) mechanism to effectively capture temporal dynamics and specific action signals within user behavior sequences. Full-scale online deployment demonstrates that GRAB significantly outperforms established DLRMs, delivering a 3.05% increase in revenue and a 3.49% rise in CTR. Furthermore, the model demonstrates desirable scaling behavior: its expressive power shows a monotonic and approximately linear improvement as longer interaction sequences are utilized.</description>

      <title>RANKVIDEO: Reasoning Reranking for Text-to-Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reranking is a critical component of modern retrieval systems, which typically pair an efficient first-stage retriever with a more expressive model to refine results. While large reasoning models have driven rapid progress in text-centric reranking, reasoning-based reranking for video retrieval remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RANKVIDEO, a reasoning-based reranker for video retrieval that explicitly reasons over query-video pairs using video content to assess relevance. RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. Experiments on the large-scale MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark demonstrate that RANKVIDEO consistently improves retrieval performance within a two-stage framework, yielding an average improvement of 31% on nDCG@10 and outperforming text-only and vision-language reranking alternatives, while more efficient.</description>

      <title>Merged ChemProt-DrugProt for Relation Extraction from Biomedical Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extraction of chemical-gene relations plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate interactions between chemical compounds and genes, with significant implications for drug discovery, disease understanding, and biomedical research. This paper presents a data set created by merging the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets to augment sample counts and improve model accuracy. We evaluate the merged dataset using two state of the art relationship extraction algorithms: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) specifically BioBERT, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with BioBERT. While BioBERT excels at capturing local contexts, it may benefit from incorporating global information essential for understanding chemical-gene interactions. This can be achieved by integrating GCNs with BioBERT to harness both global and local context. Our results show that by integrating the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets, we demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, particularly in CPR groups shared between the datasets. Incorporating the global context using GCN can help increase the overall precision and recall in some of the CPR groups over using just BioBERT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04638v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) promise to accelerate biomedical discovery, yet their reliability remains unclear. We introduce ARIEL (AI Research Assistant for Expert-in-the-Loop Learning), an open-source evaluation and optimization framework that pairs a curated multimodal biomedical corpus with expert-vetted tasks to probe two capabilities: full-length article summarization and fine-grained figure interpretation. Using uniform protocols and blinded PhD-level evaluation, we find that state-of-the-art models generate fluent but incomplete summaries, whereas LMMs struggle with detailed visual reasoning. We later observe that prompt engineering and lightweight fine-tuning substantially improve textual coverage, and a compute-scaled inference strategy enhances visual question answering. We build an ARIEL agent that integrates textual and visual cues, and we show it can propose testable mechanistic hypotheses. ARIEL delineates current strengths and limitations of foundation models, and provides a reproducible platform for advancing trustworthy AI in biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Self-Portrait: Deconstructing Memory in ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enable personalized and context-aware interactions, conversational AI systems have introduced a new mechanism: Memory. Memory creates what we refer to as the Algorithmic Self-portrait - a new form of personalization derived from users' self-disclosed information divulged within private conversations. While memory enables more coherent exchanges, the underlying processes of memory creation remain opaque, raising critical questions about data sensitivity, user agency, and the fidelity of the resulting portrait.
  To bridge this research gap, we analyze 2,050 memory entries from 80 real-world ChatGPT users. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (1) A striking 96% of memories in our dataset are created unilaterally by the conversational system, potentially shifting agency away from the user; (2) Memories, in our dataset, contain a rich mix of GDPR-defined personal data (in 28% memories) along with psychological insights about participants (in 52% memories); and (3)~A significant majority of the memories (84%) are directly grounded in user context, indicating faithful representation of the conversations. Finally, we introduce a framework-Attribution Shield-that anticipates these inferences, alerts about potentially sensitive memory inferences, and suggests query reformulations to protect personal information without sacrificing utility.</description>
