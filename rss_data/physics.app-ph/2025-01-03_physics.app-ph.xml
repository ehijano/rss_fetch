      <title>Equivalent Circuit Models for Waveguide-Fed, Resonant, Metamaterial Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to extracting equivalent circuit models for waveguide-fed, resonant metamaterial elements, such as the complementary, electric inductive-capacitive element (cELC). From the scattering parameters of a single waveguide-fed cELC, effective electric and magnetic polarizabilities can be determined that can be expressed in terms of equivalent lumped element circuit components. The circuit model provides considerable insight into the electromagnetic scattering properties of cELCs as a function of their geometric parameters and imparts intuition useful for element optimization. We find that planar, inherently resonant, waveguide-fed elements exhibit a set of common properties that place constraints on their coupling, maximum radiation, and other key scattering parameters. In addition, unlike simple slots and other non-resonant irises, resonant elements introduce an effective transformer to the equivalent circuit that accounts for the field enhancement occurring in such elements at resonance. We introduce a general and robust method to determine the effective circuit parameters by fitting to the extracted polarizability, extending the approach to resonant metamaterial elements integrated with physical lumped circuit components, such as packaged capacitors or varactors. We find excellent agreement between the analytical predictions and full-wave simulations, such that with one or two full-wave simulations the properties of the cELC can be determined for any externally added lumped elements. This approach can be leveraged to dramatically increase the efficiency of metasurface aperture design, especially when libraries of element responses are required.</description>

      <title>A Circular Crested Lamb Wave Resonator with Spurious Mode Suppression and Quality Factor Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, nearly all the reported Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) are straight crested LWRs, which suffer from inherent spurious modes and low quality factors (Q). For the first time, this work demonstrates a circular crested LWR. Its advantages over the straight crested LWR are presented comprehensively by studying their fundamental symmetric (S0) mode, which is the simplest and most representative Lamb wave mode. Utilizing circular crested Lamb waves, the proposed resonator avoids only utilizing waves propagating in the lateral direction in the straight crested LWRs, thus eliminating the transverse spurious modes as no transverse direction exists. Besides, different from straight crested Lamb waves maintaining the same displacement amplitude along the propagation direction, circular crested Lamb waves exhibit displacement attenuation toward device edges, which effectively concentrates energy in the device center, assists in reducing energy loss through anchors, and improves Q. Based on 20 at.% scandium-doped aluminum nitride (Al0.8Sc0.2N) thin films, the microfabricated circular crested LWR effectively suppresses transverse spurious modes and achieves a 40.7% Q improvement in experiments with no degradation in effective electromechanical coupling coefficients (keff2) compared with the conventional straight crested LWR when working in S0 mode in experiments, in contrast with the conventional straight crested LWR which shows inherent experimental transverse spurious modes. Moreover, the free edges covered by top electrodes enhance device robustness against misalignment and over-etching in the fabrication process. With the advantages of spurious mode suppression, Q enhancement, and fabrication robustness, the circular crested LWR is a promising candidate for next-generation filters and oscillators.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics in spin wave active ring oscillator (SWARO) driven near a dipole gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of spin wave active ring oscillators (SWAROs) injected with GHz drive signal. The injected signal frequency was swept over a 5 MHz wide frequency range across a magnetostatic surface spin wave (MSSW) dipole gap, with the drive power varying from -10 to 10 dBm. We measured the output power spectra from the SWARO at different gains for each drive power and frequency combination. Near the drive frequency, we observe the formation of sidebands, which are the products of the nonlinear scattering processes. Furthermore, at higher drive amplitudes, the spin wave nonlinearity in the ring oscillator is suppressed, and the SWARO spectrum is pulled toward the drive frequency.</description>

      <title>Electron Microscopy Study of Core-Shell Nanowire Bending and Twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous bending of core-shell nanowires through asymmetric shell deposition has implications for sensors, enabling both parallel fabrication and creating advantageous out-of-plane nanowire sensor geometries. This study investigates the impact of shell deposition geometry on the shell distribution and bending of GaAs-InP core-shell nanowires. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy methods are employed to quantify nanowire twisting and bending. A practical analytical electron tomography reconstruction technique is developed for characterizing the nanowire shell distribution, which utilizes the hexagonal nanowire shape to reconstruct two-dimensional cross-sections along the nanowire length. The study reveals that the orientation of the phosphorus beam with respect to the nanowire side facets induces significant variations in nanowire bending and twisting. The findings demonstrate the important role of crystallographic orientation during core-shell nanowire synthesis for engineering the shape of bent nanowire sensors.</description>

      <title>Integrative Learning of Intensity Fluctuations of Quantum Dots under Excitation via a Tailored Mixture Hidden Markov Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant interest in various scientific fields due to their unique fluorescence properties. One captivating characteristic of QDs is their ability to emit photons under continuous excitation. The intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different dots even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. As such, conventional approaches in the chemistry literature, typified by single-dot analysis of raw intensity data with Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM), cannot meet the many analytical challenges and may fail to capture any novel yet rare fluctuation patterns among QDs. Collaborating with scientists in the chemistry field, we have developed an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series of multiple QDs. Our approach still inherits the HMM as the skeleton to model the intensity fluctuations of each dot, and based on the data structure and the hypothesized collective behaviors of the QDs, our approach asserts that (i) under each hidden state, the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, (ii) the state distributions are shared across all the QDs, and (iii) the patterns of transitions can vary across QDs. These unique features allow for a precise characterization of the intensity fluctuation patterns and facilitate the clustering of the QDs. With experimental data collected on 128 QDs, our methods reveal several QD clusters characterized by unique transition patterns across three intensity states. The results provide deeper insight into QD behaviors and their design/application potentials.</description>

      <title>Architecture for coherent dual-comb spectroscopy and low-noise photonic microwave generation using mechanically actuated soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr soliton microcombs have inspired various intriguing applications such as spectroscopy, ranging, telecommunication, and high purity microwave generation. Mechanically actuated soliton microcombs provide enhanced controllability and flexibility for Kerr solitons, thus enabling technological progress to be made on such practical applications. Here, we present architectures for coherent dual-comb techniques and ultralow-noise microwave generation by exploiting the mechanical actuation of ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonators. By unifying a pump laser, we demonstrate highly coherent dual-soliton combs using distinct resonators with slightly different repetition rates. We also report significant phase noise reduction achieved by directly generating Kerr solitons from a sub-Hz linewidth ultrastable laser. This study paves the way for further advancements in a wide variety of applications based on Kerr soliton microcombs.</description>

      <title>Enhanced optical performance of GaN Micro-light-emitting diodes with a single porous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-efficiency micro-light-emitting diodes (Micro-LEDs) are key devices for next-generation display technology. However, when the mesa size is reduced to around tens of micrometers or less, the luminous efficiency is constrained by the "efficiency-on-size effect". This work details the fabrication of gallium nitride (GaN) based Micro-LEDs with various mesa shapes and a single porous layer under the active region. A modified green LED epitaxial structure with different doped n-GaN layers combined with electrochemical etching created the porous layer. The strong light confinement achieved by the porous layer and the polygonal mesa greatly enhances spontaneous emission. The luminous intensity of the Micro-LEDs with the porous layer is approximately 22 times greater than those Micro-LEDs without the porous layer. A significant reduction in minimum full width at half maximum (FWHM) was observed in polygonal devices, suggesting a change in the luminescence mechanism. The influence of varying device geometry on emission performance was investigated. Experimental results reveal that, unlike circular porous Micro-LEDs, square and hexagonal porous Micro-LEDs exhibit more pronounced resonant emission, which provides a new technological approach for the further development of high-performance Micro-LEDs and lasers.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic photonic link using an extended-InGaAs photodiode and short pulse illumination towards high-fidelity drive of superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate short pulse illumination of a high-speed extended-InGaAs photodiode at cryogenic temperatures towards its use in control and readout of superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate high detector responsivity at 1550 nm illumination at 20 mK, a wavelength band unavailable to cryogenic standard InGaAs detectors due to the temperature-dependent bandgap shift. Second, we demonstrate an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the shot noise limit for cryogenic short optical pulse detection when compared to conventional modulated continuous-wave laser detection. At 40 uA of photocurrent and a detector temperature of 4 K, short pulse detection yields an SNR improvement of 20 dB and 3 dB for phase and amplitude quadratures, respectively. Lastly, we discuss how short pulse detection offers a path for signal multiplexing, with a demonstration of simultaneous production of microwave pulses at two different carrier frequencies. Together, these advancements establish a path towards low noise and power efficient multiplexed photonic links for quantum computing with a large number of superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Constriction and contact impedance of ceramic solid electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of solid-state batteries is hindered by the degradation of the solid-solid interface during cycling which can cause void formation and contact loss. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of unrecoverable and real interfacial contact area at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface on the impedance spectrum. By varying applied stack pressures and controlling contact geometries, we identify their distinct signatures in the impedance spectrum and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and effective ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte. Experimental results demonstrate that higher pressures and improved contact areas significantly reduce interfacial resistance. The interfacial resistance scales with pressure according to power law with exponent of -0.5, providing insights into the variation of real contact area. Further, distributed contacts lead to lower impedance compared to concentrated contacts due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Our simulations predict interfacial resistances of the contact geometries in agreement with experiments. Our work emphasizes the distinct roles of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses in controlling the impedance of solid-state batteries.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous tantala photonic integrated circuits for sub-micron wavelength applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic and trapped-ion systems are the backbone of a new generation of quantum-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) technologies. The miniaturization of such quantum systems offers tremendous technological advantages, especially the reduction of system size, weight, and power consumption. Yet, this has been limited by the absence of compact, standalone photonic integrated circuits (PICs) at the wavelengths suitable for these instruments. Mobilizing such photonic systems requires development of fully integrated, on-chip, active components at sub-micrometer wavelengths. We demonstrate heterogeneous photonic integrated circuits operating at 980 nm based on wafer-scale bonding of InGaAs quantum well active regions to tantalum pentoxide passive components. This high-yield process provides &gt; 95 % surface area yield and enables integration of &gt; 1300 active components on a 76.2 mm (3 inch) silicon wafer. We present a diverse set of functions, including semiconductor optical amplifiers, Fabry-Perot lasers, and distributed feedback lasers with 43 dB side-mode suppression ratio and &gt; 250 GHz single-mode tuning range. We test the precise wavelength control and system level functionality of the on-chip lasers by pumping optical parametric oscillation processes in microring resonators fabricated on the same platform, generating short-wavelength signals at 778 nm and 752 nm. These results provide a pathway to realize fully functional integrated photonic engines for operation of compact quantum sensors based on atomic and trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lenses are typically based on refractive index profiles derived from the geometric approximation of high-frequency waves, yet the critical issue of impedance mismatch is often neglected. Mismatched devices suffer from unwanted reflections and dispersion, which can significantly degrade performance in practical applications. In this work, we propose impedance profiles for lenses to achieve efficient wave transmission while maintaining the desired refractive index and minimizing dispersion effects. A family of impedance profiles is derived from the acoustic wave equation such that the phase velocity is preserved. First, the 1D setting is considered to explain how dispersion occurs inside a lens and at its interfaces. Then, the method is applied to 2D axisymmetric configurations where the impedance mismatch is radially redistributed. These profiles are demonstrated in the acoustic setting of a Luneburg lens, but can be easily extended to more general scenarios such as imaging or cloaking in air and water, where matching the impedance of the background poses significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Understanding Memristive Behavior: An Atomistic Study of the Influence of Grain Boundaries on Surface and Out-of-Plane Diffusion of Metallic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic migration from metallic contacts, and subsequent filament formation, is recognised as a prevailing mechanism leading to resistive switching in memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs). This study presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration of different metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs, employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-Equilibrium Green's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms, Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration both in the out-of-plane direction through a MoS\textsubscript{2} layer and along the surface of the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical and lateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually present in MoS\textsubscript{2} are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion of metal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristine MoS\textsubscript{2} and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the key elements that affect the switching performance of memristors. Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate the effects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance, providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.</description>

      <title>Gradient polaritonic surface with space-variant switchable light-matter interactions in 2D moire superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaritons in two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique opportunities for controlling light at nanoscales. Tailoring these polaritons via gradient polaritonic surfaces with space-variant response can enable versatile light-matter interaction platforms with advanced functionalities. However, experimental progress has been hampered by the optical losses and poor light confinement of conventionally used artificial nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate natural gradient polaritonic surfaces based on superlattices of solitons-localized structural deformations-in a prototypical moire system, twisted bilayer graphene on boron nitride. We demonstrate on-off switching and continuous modulation of local polariton-soliton interactions, which results from marked modifications of topological and conventional soliton states through variation of local strain direction. Furthermore, we reveal the capability of these structures to spatially modify the near-field profile, phase, and propagation direction of polaritons in record-small footprints, enabling generation and electrical switching of directional polaritons. Our findings open up new avenues toward nanoscale manipulation of light-matter interactions and spatial polariton engineering through gradient moire superlattices.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of a Hybrid Solid Liquid Vibration Energy Harvester: Numerical Simulation &amp; Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have introduced and studied the feasibility of a hybrid solid liquid vibration energy harvester. The energy harvester consists of a ferrofluid partially filled in a tank and a piezoelectric beam fixed at one of the tank walls. The tank is assumed to be placed in a nonuniform magnetic field created by placing two powerful magnets symmetrically external to the tank walls. This magnetic field was then implemented by a Magnetic field function modeling the magnetic field produced by the two magnets. We used piezoelectric beam configurations and oscillation loads to study and characterize this 2D multiscale, multiphysics, and multiphase fluid structure interaction. The tank is subjected to an external oscillatory motion, which sloshes the ferrofluid and oscillates the beam utilizing two modes, one due to the beams inertia and the second due to the impact of the ferrofluid on the beam. The parameters varied in piezo materials, ferrofluid fill height, piezoelectric beam length, and oscillation frequency. The natural frequency modes for the piezoelectric beam are very important since the beam harvests the highest power in those modes. We have observed that when the fluid motion vibrates the beam, in some instances, the voltage output from piezoelectric material peaks to a high value, which is indicative of material nearing resonance frequencies at the fluid loading realized in those instances. However, in other cases, the voltage output varies with the loading, and hence, the response of the piezoelectric beam is broadband, very similar to the sloshing, which is inherently broadband.</description>

      <title>Angular-Controlled GST Phase-Change Double Micro-Ring Resonator for High-Speed Activation Functions in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the drive toward efficient neuromorphic computing, photonic technologies offer promising solutions for implementing neural functionalities. Here we demonstrate the first all-optical double micro-ring resonator incorporating Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) as a phase-change material to realize precise nonlinear activation functions (NLAF). Our device architecture achieves switching speeds of 0.5 ns through a novel approach to GST integration, where angular positioning of GST segments within the rings enables unprecedented control over optical transmission characteristics. Through systematic investigation of sixteen distinct phase configurations, we identify optimal GST positioning (180 degrees in the first ring, 90 degrees in the second) that achieves ultra-narrow band transmission with 0.47 nm full width at half maximum. Operating at significantly lower temperatures (100 degrees centigrade) than conventional GST implementations, our device maintains high contrast ratios with transmission coefficient modulation from near-zero to 0.85 across a 4 nm spectral window. The dual-ring architecture enables independent optimization of spectral selectivity and switching contrast a capability previously unattainable in single ring designs. These results demonstrate a viable pathway toward efficient neuromorphic photonic systems that can operate at speeds relevant for practical computing applications while maintaining the precision required for neural processing.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</description>

      <title>Effect of trap states, ion migration and interfaces on carrier transport in single crystal, polycrystalline and thick film devices of halide perovskites CH$_3$NH$_3$PbX$_3$ (X= I, Br, Cl)</title>

Abstract: The understanding of the mixed ionic-electronic nature of charge transport in Metal Halide Perovskites (MHPs) and the role of morphological and interface defects is crucial for improving the performance of MHP based photovoltaic devices. We present results of a parallel study on MAPbX$_3$ (X = I, Br and Cl), synthesized as solution processed polycrystalline powders, and as single crystals grown by a facile low temperature assisted technique. We have studied ionic-electronic charge transport in single-crystal and polycrystalline (pressed pellet and thick film) samples in order to compare the effect of defects and trap states associated with halide ion migration, device morphology and interfaces at grain boundaries as well as at electrodes. The mobility of halide ions and associated Coulomb capture of electrons or holes was determined by dielectric and space charge limited current (SCLC) dark I-V measurements, and also simulated using an ionic-electronic model. The defect capture cross section of electronic charge was found to be proportional to the simulated halide ion density Nion, which varied in the range $10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ - $10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ depending on the halide ion. The trap state density from I-V measurements, Ntrap ~ $10^9$ - $10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, was found to be lower than previous reports. Single crystal MAPbI3 devices exhibited a low capture cross section ($\sigma$ ~ $10^{-16}$ cm$^{-2}$), high mobility ($\mu$ ~ 196 cm$^2$/V-s) and large diffusion length (LD ~ 6 $\mu$m). The study shows that non-radiative energy loss and carrier trapping are suppressed and transport properties enhanced by reducing grain boundary effects, along with interface engineering to prevent halide ion accumulation at the electrodes.</description>

Abstract: Infrared diodes generate electricity from thermal radiation emitted from themselves. The negative process of photovoltaic effect has been expected for application to energy harvesting systems converting from terrestrial radiation. However, its energy conversion efficiency has been known to be very low. In this paper, we investigate energy conversion efficiency and external quantum efficiency for the negative-illumination photovoltaic effect with a systematic measurement for infrared diodes faced to a sufficiently cold surface. We find that the external quantum efficiency reaches 60\ \% for a diode at a temperature, while the energy conversion efficiency stays below 10^-4 %. We indicate dominant parameters for the efficiencies and propose how to improve energy conversion efficiency.</description>

      <title>Entanglement engineering of optomechanical systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</description>
