      <title>Reduced superschemes and the combinatorics of toric supervarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new definitions of integral, reduced, and normal superrings and superschemes to properly establish the notion of a supervariety. We generalize several results about classical reduced rings and varieties to the supergeometric setting, including an equivalence of categories between certain toric supervarieties and decorated polyhedral fans. These decorated fans are shown to encode important geometric information about the corresponding toric supervarieties. We then investigate some naturally-occurring toric supervarieties inside the isomeric supergrassmannian, which we show admits a nice description as a decorated polytope.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Dynamics on Character Varieties over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the lack of asymptotic transitivity of the outer automorphism group action of $\mathbb{Z}^r$ on $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$-character varieties of $\mathbb{Z}^r$ for $n=2,3$ and $r\geq 2$. Along the way, we stratify the character varieties and compute the $E$-polynomial, also known as the Hodge-Deligne polynomial or Serre polynomial, of these character varieties.</description>

      <title>On some boundary divisors in the moduli spaces of stable Horikawa surfaces with $K^2=2p_g-3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the normal stable surfaces with K^2=2p_g-3 and p_g&gt;14 whose only non canonical singularity is a cyclic quotient singularity of type 1/4k(1,2k-1) and the corresponding locus D inside the KSBA moduli space of stable surfaces. More precisely, we show that: (1) a general point of any irreducible component of D corresponds to a surface with a singularity of type 1/4(1,1), (2) the closure of D is a divisor contained in the closure of the Gieseker moduli space of canonical models of surfaces with K^2=2p_g-3 and intersects all the components of such closure, and (3) the KSBA moduli space is smooth at a general point of D. In addition, we show that D has 1 or 2 irreducible components, depending on the residue class of p_g modulo 4.</description>

Abstract: We study some functorial properties of certain sheaves of meromorphic forms on reduced complex space; particulary, the meromorphic forms which extend holomorphicaly on any desingularisation. The purpose concern their behavior under pull back and higher direct image (and in some case by integration on fibres of equidimensional or open morphism).</description>

      <title>Thom polynomials for singularities of maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16727v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a gentle introduction to a general theory of universal polynomials associated to classification of map-germs, called Thom polynomials. The theory was originated by Ren\'e Thom in the 1950s and has since been evolved in various aspects by many authors. In a nutshell, this is about intersection theory on certain moduli spaces, say `classifying spaces of mono/multi-singularities of maps', which provides consistent and deep insights into both classical and modern enumerative geometry with many potential applications.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be an odd dimensional complex vector space and $\mbox{IF}:=\mbox{IF}(1,2;E)$ be the family of odd symplectic partial flag manifold. In this paper we give a full description of the irreducible components of the degree $d$ curve neighborhood of any Schubert variety of $\mbox{IF}$, study their lattice structure, and prove a combinatorial version of Conjecture $\mathcal{O}.$</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Tate conjectures over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an analogue of Tate conjecture on algebraic cycles, for the log geometry over a finite field. We show that the weight-monodromy conjecture follows from this conjecture and from the semi-simplicity of the Frobenius action. This conjecture suggests the existence of the monodromy cycle which gives the monodromy operator and an action of ${\frak{sl}}(2)$ on the cohomology, and which lives in the world of log motives.</description>

Abstract: Using a very elementary technique, we construct a first example of Ziegler pairs of hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$. Then, using this construction, we show how to obtain possible counterexamples to Terao's freeness conjecture in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ with $n&gt;2$ using arrangements of lines in $\mathbb{P}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Lotuses as computational architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lotuses are certain types of finite contractible simplicial complexes, obtained by identifying vertices of polygons subdivided by diagonals. As we explained in a previous paper, each time one resolves a complex reduced plane curve singularity by a sequence of toroidal modifications with respect to suitable local coordinates, one gets a naturally associated lotus, which allows to unify the classical trees used to encode the combinatorial type of the singularity. In this paper we explain how to associate a lotus to each constellation of crosses, which is a finite constellation of infinitely near points endowed with compatible germs of normal crossings divisors with two components, and how this lotus may be seen as a computational architecture. Namely, if the constellation of crosses is associated to an embedded resolution of a complex reduced plane curve singularity $A$, one may compute progressively as vertex and edge weights on the lotus the log-discrepancies of the exceptional divisors, the orders of vanishing on them of the starting coordinates, the multiplicities of the strict transforms of the branches of $A$, the orders of vanishing of a defining function of $A$, the associated Eggers-Wall tree, the delta invariant and the Milnor number of $A$, etc. We illustrate these computations using three recurrent examples. Finally, we describe the changes to be done when one works in positive characteristic.</description>

Abstract: We prove the logarithmic extension theorem for one-forms on strongly $F$-regular singularities. Additionally, we establish the logarithmic extension theorem for one-forms on three-dimensional klt singularities in characteristic $p&gt;41$. To this end, we reduce the problem to the logarithmic extension theorem for two-dimensional klt singularities with imperfect residue fields using a technique based on Cartier operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a formula for structure constants of the quantum mirror to a log Calabi Yau surface $(Y,D)$ in terms of descendent logarithmic Gromov--Witten invariants of $(Y,D)$. Our result generalises the weak Frobenius structure conjecture for surfaces to the $q$-refined setting, and is proved by relating these invariants to counts of quantum broken lines in the associated quantum scattering diagram.</description>

      <title>On Andr\'e periods of mixed Tate motives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that the $p$-adic periods of motives introduced recently by Ancona and Fr\u{a}\c{t}il\u{a} (``Andr\'e periods'') reduce to the classically studied notion in the case of Mixed Tate motives. We also connect Andr\'e periods with Coleman integration by observing that the Frobenius-fixed de Rham paths of Besser and Vologodsky come from motivic paths in characteristic $p$ (unconditionally in the mixed Tate setting, conditionally in general). We use this to realize special values of $p$-adic multiple polylogarithms as Andr\'e periods in a concrete way.</description>

      <title>Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz invariants and tropical varieties of integral homology jump loci</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Papadima and Suciu studied the relationship between the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz (short as BNSR) invariants of spaces and the homology jump loci of rank one local systems. Recently, Suciu improved these results using the tropical variety associated to the homology jump loci of complex rank one local systems. In particular, the translated positive-dimensional component of homology jump loci can be detected by its tropical variety. In this paper, we generalize Suciu's results to integral coefficients and give a better upper bound for the BNSR invariants. Then we provide applications mainly to K\"ahler groups. Specifically, we classify the K\"ahler group contained in a large class of groups, which we call the weighted right-angled Artin groups. This class of groups comes from the edge-weighted finite simple graphs and is a natural generalization of the right-angled Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components of affine Lusztig varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\breve{G}$ be a loop group and $\tilde W$ be its Iwahori-Weyl group. The affine Lusztig variety $Y_w(\gamma)$ describes the intersection of the Bruhat cell $\mathcal{I} \dot{w} \mathcal{I}$ for $w \in \tilde W$ with the conjugacy class of $\gamma \in \breve{G}$, while the affine Deligne-Lusztig variety $X_w(b)$ describes the intersection of the Bruhat cell $\mathcal{I} \dot{w} \mathcal{I}$ with the Frobenius-twisted conjugacy class of $b \in \breve{G}$. Although the geometric connections between these varieties are unknown, numerical relations exist in their geometric properties.
  This paper explores the irreducible components of affine Lusztig varieties. The centralizer of $\g$ acts on $Y_w(\g)$ and the Frobenius-twisted centralizer of $b$ acts on $X_w(b)$. We relate the number of orbits on the top-dimensional components of $Y_w(\gamma)$ to the numbers of orbits on top-dimensional components of $X_w(b)$ and the affine Springer fibers. For split groups and elements $\gamma$ with integral Newton points, we show that, for most $w$, the numbers of orbits for the affine Lusztig variety and the associated affine Deligne-Lusztig variety match. Moreover, for these $\g$, we verify Chi's conjecture that the number of top-dimensional components in $Y_\mu(\gamma)$ within the affine Grassmannian equals to the dimension of a specific weight space in a representation of the Langlands dual group.</description>

      <title>Hall Polynomials for Weighted projective lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the triangle singularity defined by the \linebreak equation $f=X_1^{p_1}+X_2^{p_2}+X_3^{p_3}$ for weight triple $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$, as well as the category of coherent sheaves over the weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ defined by $f$. We calculate Hall polynomials associated to extensions bundles, line bundles and torsion sheaves over $\mathbb{X}$. By using derived equivalence, this provides a unified conceptual method for calculating Hall polynomials for representations of tame quivers obtained by Sz\'ant\'o and Sz\"oll\H{o}si [J. Pure Appl. Alg. {\bf 228} (2024)].</description>

      <title>Rigidity and Realizability for Tropical Curves in Dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an unobstructedness criterion for Lagrangian threefolds $L\subset X^A$ using the $H_1(L)$-class associated with the boundary of a pseudoholomorphic disk.
  As an application, let $X^A\to Q$ be a Lagrangian torus fibration whose base $Q$ is a tropical abelian threefold. Given $V\subset Q$ a rigid tropical curve with a pair-of-pants decomposition, we prove that the Lagrangian lift $L_V\subset X^A$ is unobstructed.
  Provided that an appropriate homological mirror symmetry statement holds, this implies the existence of a realization $Y_V$ in the mirror abelian threefold $X^B\to Q$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic independence of the solutions of the classical Lotka-Volterra system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$ be distinct non-constant and non-degenerate solutions of the classical Lotka-Volterra system \begin{equation}\notag \begin{split} x'&amp;= axy + bx\\ y'&amp;= cxy + dy, \end{split} \end{equation} where $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$. We show that if $\frac{d}{b}\not\in\mathbb{Q}$, then the solutions are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{C}$, that is $tr.deg_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}(x_1,y_1,\ldots,x_n,y_n)=2n$. As a main part of the proof, we show that the set defined by the system in universal differential fields, with $\frac{d}{b}\not\in\mathbb{Q}$, is strongly minimal and geometrically trivial. Our techniques also allows us to obtain partial results for some of the more general $2d$-Lotka-Volterra system.</description>

      <title>The surface parametrizing cuboids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0388</link>
      <description>arXiv:1009.0388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the surface $\bar{S}$ parametrizing cuboids: it is defined by the equations relating the sides, face diagonals and long diagonal of a rectangular box. It is an open problem whether a `rational box' exists, i.e., a rectangular box all of whose sides, face diagonals and long diagonal have (positive) rational length. The question is equivalent to the existence of nontrivial rational points on $\bar{S}$.
  Let $S$ be the minimal desingularization of $\bar{S}$ (which has 48 isolated singular points). The main result of this paper is the explicit determination of the Picard group of $S$, including its structure as a Galois module over $\mathbb Q$. The main ingredient for showing that the known subgroup is actually the full Picard group is the use of the combined action of the Galois group and the geometric automorphism group of $S$ (which we also determine) on the Picard group. This reduces the proof to checking that the hyperplane section is not divisible by 2 in the Picard group.
  We use our explicit knowledge of the Picard group, together with that of a K3 surface obtained as a quotient of $S$, to study curves of low degree on $\bar{S}$. In this way, we completely classify all integral curves of degree at most 6 on $\bar{S}$.</description>

      <title>Construction of Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper after proving (in Section 2) the Berkovich analytic space analog of the familiar fact that there exist many non-isomorphic Riemann surfaces of the fixed topological type, I introduce the precise notion of Arithmetic Holomorphic Structures. This leads, for a fixed geometrically connected, smooth quasi-projective variety $X/E$ over a $p$-adic field, to the construction of a category which can be called Arithmetic Teichmuller Space of $X/E$. After establishing the properties of this local i.e. $p$-adic Arithmetic Teichmuller Space, I proceed to the global (adelic) construction, for a geometrically connected, smooth quasi-projective variety $X/L$ over a number field $L$, of the Adelic Arithmetic Teichmuller Space of $X/L$. A fixed number field itself has an Arithmetic Teichmuller Space--this is detailed in Constructions II(1/2) paper in this series of papers. All of these constructions extend the analogy between Number fields and Riemann surfaces and are inspired by (and directly related to) Shinichi Mochizuki's ideas on Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory and his work on the abc-conjecture. But my approach is based on a completely different set of ideas.</description>

      <title>Strict homotopy invariance via compactified homotopies and correspondences, and fibres of essentially smooth schemes over one-dimensional base schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01006v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the technique of compactified correspondences and homotopies over one-dimensional base schemes, and illuminate the perfectness and the inverting of characteristic assumptions from the celebrating Voevodsky's strict homotopy invariance theorem and its framed correspondences generalisation over an arbitrary base field. The assumption in this crucial theorem for Voevodsky's motives theory %over a field was kept from the origins of the study, and came later into more modern theory of framed motives by Garkusha-Panin. Applying the technique, we obtain also analogs of Gersten and Nisnevich conjectures for Cousin complexes of generalised motivic cohomotopies over a field, and acyclicity of Cousin complexes on generic fibres of essentially smooth local schemes over one-dimensional base schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of irregular fibrations of a variety under derived equivalence of its bounded derived category. In particular we prove the derived invariance of the existence of an irregular fibration over a variety of general type, extending the case of irrational pencils onto curves of genus $g\geq 2$. We also prove that a derived equivalence of such fibrations induces a derived equivalence between their general fibers.</description>

      <title>Construction of Arithmetic Teichmuller spaces II: Proof of a local prototype of Mochizuki's Corollary 3.12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with consequences of the existence of Arithmetic Teichmuller spaces established in arXiv:2106.11452 and arXiv:2210.11635. Theorem~9.2.1 provides a proof of a local version of Mochizuki's Corollary~3.12. Local means for a fixed $p$-adic field. There are several new innovations in this paper. Some of the main results are as follows. Theorem~3.5.1 shows that one can view the Tate parameter of Tate elliptic curve as a function on the arithmetic Teichmuller space of [Joshi, 2021a], [Joshi, 2022b]. The next important point is the construction of Mochizuki's $\Theta_{gau}$-links and the set of such links, called Mochizuki's Ansatz in {\S}6. Theorem~6.9.1 establishes valuation scaling property satisfied by points of Mochizuki's Ansatz (i.e. by my version of $\Theta_{gau}$-links). These results lead to the construction of a theta-values set ({\S}8) which is similar to Mochizuki's Theta-values set (differences between the two are in {\S}8.7.1). Finally Theorem~9.2.1 is established. For completeness, I provide an intrinsic proof of the existence of Mochizuki's $\log$-links (Theorem 10.9.1), $\mathfrak{log}$-links (Theorem~10.15.1) and Mochizuki's log-Kummer Indeterminacy (Theorem~10.20.1) in my theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that if a $3$-dimensional quasi-projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;3$ has only log canonical singularities, then so does a general hyperplane section $H$ of $X$. We also show that the same is true for klt singularities, which is a slight extension of \cite{ST20}. In the course of the proof, we provide a sufficient condition for log canonical (resp.~klt) surface singularities to be geometrically log canonical (resp.~geometrically klt) over a field.</description>

      <title>Gluing of Fourier-Mukai partners in a triangular spectrum and birational geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balmer defined the tensor triangulated spectrum $\operatorname{Spec}_\otimes \mathcal{T}$ of a tensor triangulated category $(\mathcal{T},\otimes)$ and showed that for a variety $X$, we have the reconstruction $X \cong \operatorname{Spec}_{\otimes_{\mathscr{O}_X}^{\mathbb{L}}}\operatorname{Perf} X$. In the absence of the tensor structure, Matsui recently introduced the triangular spectrum $\operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \mathcal{T}$ of a triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ and showed that there exists an immersion $X \cong \operatorname{Spec}_{\otimes_{\mathscr{O}_X}^{\mathbb{L}}}\operatorname{Perf} X \subset \operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \operatorname{Perf} X$. In this paper, we construct a scheme $\operatorname{Spec}^{\mathsf{FM}} \mathcal{T} \subset \operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \mathcal{T}$, called the Fourier-Mukai (FM) locus, by gathering all varieties $X$ satisfying $\operatorname{Perf} X \simeq \mathcal{T}$. Those varieties are called FM partners of $\mathcal{T}$ and immersed into $\operatorname{Spec}_\vartriangle \mathcal{T}$ as tensor triangulated spectra. We present a variety of examples illustrating how geometric and birational properties of FM partners are reflected in the way their tensor triangulated spectra are glued in the FM locus. Finally, we compare the FM locus with other loci within the triangular spectrum admitting categorical characterizations, and in particular, make a precise conjecture about the relation of the FM locus with the Serre invariant locus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety. Define a stable map $f:C\to X$ to be "eventually smoothable" if there is an embedding $X\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}^N$ such that $(C,f)$ occurs as the limit of a $1$-parameter family of stable maps to $\mathbb{P}^N$ with smooth domain curves. Via an explicit deformation-theoretic construction, we produce a large class of stable maps (called "stable maps with model ghosts"), and show that they are eventually smoothable.</description>

      <title>Counting Curves with Tangencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10759v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting tangency as a limit of two transverse intersections, we obtain a concrete formula to enumerate smooth degree $d$ plane curves tangent to a given line at multiple points with arbitrary order of tangency. Extending that idea, we then enumerate curves with one node with multiple tangencies to a given line of any order. Subsequently, we enumerate curves with one cusp, that are tangent to first order to a given line at multiple points. We also present a new way to enumerate curves with one node; it is interpreted as a degeneration of a curve tangent to a given line. That method is extended to enumerate curves with two nodes, and also curves with one tacnode are enumerated. In the final part of the paper, it is shown how this idea can be applied in the setting of stable maps and perform a concrete computation to enumerate rational curves with first-order tangency. A large number of low degree cases have been worked out explicitly.</description>

      <title>The affine Grassmannian as a presheaf quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$ over a ring $A$, its affine Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_G$ plays important roles in a wide range of subjects and is typically defined as the \'etale sheafification of the presheaf quotient $LG/L^+G$ of the loop group $LG$ by its positive loop subgroup $L^+G$. We show that the Zariski sheafification gives the same result. Moreover, for totally isotropic $G$ (for instance, for quasi-split $G$), we show that no sheafification is needed at all: $\mathrm{Gr}_G$ is already the presheaf quotient $LG/L^+G$, which seems new already in the classical case of $G$ over $\mathbb{C}$. For totally isotropic $G$, we also show that the affine Grassmannian may be formed using polynomial loops. We deduce all of these results from the study of $G$-torsors on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ that is ultimately built on the geometry of $\mathrm{Bun}_G$.</description>

      <title>Morse theory of Euclidean distance functions from algebraic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a closed definable subset and $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a smooth manifold. We construct a version of Morse Theory for the restriction to $X$ of the Euclidean distance function from $Y$. This is done using the notion of critical points of Lipschitz functions and applying the theory of continuous selections. In this theory, nondegenerate critical points have two indices: a quadratic index (as in classical Morse Theory), and a piecewise linear index (that relates to the notion of bottlenecks). This framework is flexible enough to simultaneously treat and unify the study of two cases of interest for computational algebraic geometry: bottlenecks and nearest point problems. We provide a technical toolset guaranteeing the applicability of the theory to the case where $X, Y$ are generic algebraic hypersurfaces and use it to bound the number of critical points of the distance from $Y$ restricted to $X$, among other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beilinson gave a resolution of the diagonal for complex projective spaces, which Bayer-Popescu-Sturmfels generalized to what they refer to as unimodular projective toric varieties. The unimodular condition in Bayer-Popescu-Sturmfels' convention is more restrictive than being smooth. In the smooth, non-unimodular setting, extra vertices appear in the finite cellular complex which Bayer-Popescu-Sturmfels previously used to resolve the diagonal for unimodular projective toric varieties. We use the floor function to assign monomial labelings in a convex manner, and show that this assignment is compatible with the graded algebra involving the irrelevant ideal to give a resolution of the diagonal for a smooth projective toric variety.</description>

As an application, we prove that every Feigin-Odesskii Poisson bracket on a projective space can be included into a 5-dimensional linear space of compatible Poisson brackets. We also construct new examples of linear spaces of compatible Feigin-Odesskii Poisson brackets of dimension $&gt;5$, coming from del Pezzo surfaces of degree $&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>On retract rationality for finite connected group schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we prove the retract rationality of the classifying spaces $BG$ for several types of finite connected group schemes $G$ over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic $p&gt;0$. In particular, we prove the retract rationality for the finite simple group schemes $G$ associated with the generalized Witt algebras in specific cases. To this end, we study the automorphism group schemes of the generalized Witt algebras and establish triangulations for them. Moreover, we extend the notion of Witt--Ree algebra to general base rings and discuss their properties.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of blowups via Weyl chamber decompositions and actions on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of $X^n_s$, the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^n_\mathbb{C}$ at $s$ points in general position. We identify a set of subvarieties, which we call Weyl $r$-planes, that belong to an orbit for the action of the Weyl group on $r$-cycles. They satisfy the following properties: they appear as stable base locus of divisors; each Weyl $r$-plane is swept out by an $(n-r)$-moving curve class; moreover, if $s\ge n+3$, for any fixed $r$ all these curve classes belong to the same orbit for the Weyl action.
  For Mori dream spaces of type $X^n_s$, all such orbits are finite and they allow to reinterpret Mukai's description of the Mori chamber decomposition of the effective cone in terms of $(n-r)$-moving curve classes, unifying previous different approaches.
  If $X^n_s$ is not a Mori dream space, there are infinitely many Weyl $r$-planes. These yields the definition of the Weyl chamber decomposition of the pseudoeffective cone of divisors, that is a coarsening of the Mori chamber decomposition, wherever the latter is defined. We conjecture that, for $s=n+4$, the Mori and the Weyl chamber decompositions coincide within the negative part of the effective cone. Moreover, we describe the pseudoeffective cone of $X^5_9$ via its infinitely many extremal rays.</description>

      <title>A new transversality condition on orbifolds and integer-valued Gromov-Witten type invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a proposal of Fukaya-Ono and the exploration by B. Parker, we introduce a new transversality condition, the FOP transversality condition, for sections of orbifold vector bundles $\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}$ when both $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ have "normal complex structures." This notion allows one to define various integral virtual cycles on moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves. Two immediate applications in symplectic topology are the definition of integer-valued Gromov-Witten type invariants in all genera for general compact symplectic manifolds using the global Kuranishi chart constructed by Abouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirschi-Swaminathan, and an alternative proof of the cohomological splitting theorem for Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$ with integer coefficients by Abouzaid-McLean-Smith.</description>

      <title>Canonical representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,n}$ be an orientable surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures. We study actions of the mapping class group of $\Sigma_{g,n}$ via Hodge-theoretic and arithmetic techniques. We show that if $$\rho: \pi_1(\Sigma_{g,n})\to GL_r(\mathbb{C})$$ is a representation whose conjugacy class has finite orbit under the mapping class group, and $r&lt;\sqrt{g+1}$, then $\rho$ has finite image. This answers questions of Junho Peter Whang and Mark Kisin. We give applications of our methods to the Putman-Wieland conjecture, the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, and a question of Esnault-Kerz.
  The proofs rely on non-abelian Hodge theory, our earlier work on semistability of isomonodromic deformations, and recent work of Esnault-Groechenig and Klevdal-Patrikis on Simpson's integrality conjecture for cohomologically rigid local systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the question whether a given homogeneous ideal is a limit of saturated ones. We provide cohomological necessary criteria for this to hold and apply them to a range of examples. Our motivation comes from the theory of border apolarity and varieties of sums of powers, where the question above is tightly connected to proving new lower bounds for border ranks of tensors.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and zeroes of $L$-functions via probability in $\lambda$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings designed to efficiently describe random variables valued in multisets of complex numbers, varieties over a field, or other similar enriched settings. A key role is played by the $\sigma$-moment generating function based on the plethystic exponential, which allows us to describe distributions and argue with independence in a way that is as simple as classical probability theory. As a first application, we use this theory to obtain a concise description of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions describing distributions of eigenvalues of Haar random matrices in compact classical groups. Beyond the theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings, the proof uses only classical invariant theory. Using our description we reprove the results of Diaconis and Shahshahani on the joint distributions of traces of powers of matrices, and we also treat symmetric groups. Next, we use Poonen's sieve to establish equidistribution results for the zeroes of $L$-functions in some natural families: simple Dirichlet characters for $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$ and the vanishing cohomology of smooth hypersurface sections. We give concise descriptions of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions in these families, then compare them to the associated random matrix distributions. These equidistribution results are sideways in that we fix $q$ and take the degree $d$ to infinity, as opposed to Deligne equidistribution for fixed $d$ as $q \rightarrow \infty$, and the large $d$-limits are related to explicit descriptions of stable homology with twisted coefficients.</description>

      <title>Rational points and rational moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety over $\mathbb Q$. We introduce a geometric non-degenerate criterion for $X$ using moduli spaces $M$ over $\mathbb Q$ of abelian varieties. If $X$ is non-degenerate, then we construct via $M$ an open dense moduli space $U\subseteq X$ whose forgetful map defines a Parsin construction for $U(\mathbb Q)$. For example if $M$ is a Hilbert modular variety then $U$ is a coarse Hilbert moduli scheme and $X$ is non-degenerate iff a projective model $Y\subset \bar{M}$ of $X$ over $\mathbb Q$ contains no singular points of the minimal compactification $\bar{M}$. We motivate our constructions when $M$ is a rational variety over $\mathbb Q$ with $\dim(M)&gt;\dim(X)$. We study various geometric aspects of the non-degenerate criterion and we deduce arithmetic applications: If $X$ is non-degenerate, then $U(\mathbb Q)$ is finite by Faltings. Moreover, our constructions are made for the effective strategy which combines the method of Faltings (Arakelov, Parsin, Szpiro) with modularity and Masser-Wustholz isogeny estimates. When $M$ is a coarse Hilbert moduli scheme, we use this strategy to explicitly bound the height and the number of $x\in U(\mathbb Q)$ if $X$ is non-degenerate. We illustrate our approach when $M$ is the Hilbert modular surface given by the classical icosahedron surface studied by Clebsch, Klein and Hirzebruch. For any curve $X$ over $\mathbb Q$, we construct and study explicit projective models $Y\subset\bar{M}$ called ico models. If $X$ is non-degenerate, then we give via $Y$ an effective Parsin construction and an explicit Weil height bound for $x\in U(\mathbb Q)$. As most ico models are non-degenerate and $X\setminus U$ is controlled, this establishes the effective Mordell conjecture for large classes of (explicit) curves over $\mathbb Q$. We also solve the ico analogue of the generalized Fermat problem by combining our height bounds with Diophantine approximations.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Relative Canonical Bundles and Algebraicity Criteria for Foliations in K\"ahler context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, motivated by the recent preprint of W. Ou, we pursue three main objectives. The first is to make progress towards the positivity of the relative canonical bundle in the K\"ahler setting. In the second part, we provide a proof of Ou's algebraicity criterion. Finally, based on the two previous parts, we slightly extend his uniruledness criterion.</description>
