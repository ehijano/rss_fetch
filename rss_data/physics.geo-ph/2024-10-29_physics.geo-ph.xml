      <title>Turbulence in Earth's core generates large topographic torques on the mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic and geodynamic studies indicate that the boundary between the Earth's liquid outer core and solid mantle is not spherical, but is likely characterized by topography in the form of inverted mountains and valleys that have typical amplitudes of several kilometers. One of the dynamical consequences of these deformations is that turbulent flow in the core can exert pressure torques on the mantle, thereby resulting in a transfer of angular momentum between the outer core and the mantle. Understanding this transfer of angular momentum is important for explaining variations in the Earth's rotation rate, or length of day. Whether kilometer-sized topography can explain observed variations in length of day is a longstanding question in geophysics. Here we use physical scaling arguments and a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations of convection in a rotating spherical shell and show that topographic torques exhibit a linear dependence on topographic amplitude and a nearly quadratic dependence on flow speeds. These results imply that topographic torques are of sufficient magnitude to explain length of day variations on annual to decadal time scales.</description>

      <title>Crack opening calculation in phase-field modeling of fluid-filled fracture: A robust and efficient strain-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-field method has become popular for the numerical modeling of fluid-filled fractures, thanks to its ability to represent complex fracture geometry without algorithms. However, the algorithm-free representation of fracture geometry poses a significant challenge in calculating the crack opening (aperture) of phase-field fracture, which governs the fracture permeability and hence the overall hydromechanical behavior. Although several approaches have been devised to compute the crack opening of phase-field fracture, they require a sophisticated algorithm for post-processing the phase-field values or an additional parameter sensitive to the element size and alignment. Here, we develop a novel method for calculating the crack opening of fluid-filled phase-field fracture, which enables one to obtain the crack opening without additional algorithms or parameters. We transform the displacement-jump-based kinematics of a fracture into a continuous strain-based version, insert it into a force balance equation on the fracture, and apply the phase-field approximation. Through this procedure, we obtain a simple equation for the crack opening, which can be calculated with quantities at individual material points. We verify the proposed method with analytical and numerical solutions obtained based on discrete representations of fractures, demonstrating its capability to calculate the crack opening regardless of the element size or alignment.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of hydraulic fracture propagation in media with heterogeneous toughness: the energy balance, elastic battery and fluid backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates hydraulic fracture in a media with periodic heterogeneous toughness. Results for the plane-strain (KGD) model are analysed. The energy distribution as the fracture propagates is examined, along with the evolution of the crack geometry. It is shown that the solid layer acts as an elastic battery, discharging to promote rapid propagation through weaker material layers. The limiting behaviour as length $L\to\infty$ is discussed. The velocity of the fluid throughout the crack length is also considered. For fractures in high-toughness material it is shown that fluid backflow can occur, with its profile dependent on the toughness distribution. The implications of these findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Digital rock physics: calculation of effective elastic properties of heterogeneous materials using graphical processing units (GPUs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An application based on graphical processing units (GPUs) applied to 3-D digital images is described for computing the linear anisotropic elastic properties of heterogeneous materials. The application can also retrieve the property contribution tensors of individual inclusions of any shape. The code can be executed on professional GPUs as well as on a basic laptop or personal computer Nvidia GPUs. The application is extremely fast: a calculation of the effective elastic properties of volumes consisting of about 7 million voxel elements ($191^3$) takes less than 4 seconds of computational time using a single A100 GPU; 3 minutes for 100 million voxel elements ($479^3$) using a single A100 GPU; 14 minutes for 350 million voxel elements ($703^3$) using a single A100 GPU. Several comparisons against analytical solutions are provided. In addition, an evaluation of the anisotropic effective elastic properties of a 3-D digital image of a cracked Carrara marble sample is presented. The software can be downloaded from a permanent repository Zenodo, the link with a doi is given in the manuscript.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deep Learning based RMT Data Inversion using Gaussian Random Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as a powerful tool for the inversion of geophysical data. When applied to field data, these models often struggle without additional fine-tuning of the network. This is because they are built on the assumption that the statistical patterns in the training and test datasets are the same. To address this, we propose a DL-based inversion scheme for Radio Magnetotelluric data where the subsurface resistivity models are generated using Gaussian Random Fields (GRF). The network's generalization ability was tested with an out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset comprising a homogeneous background and various rectangular-shaped anomalous bodies. After end-to-end training with the GRF dataset, the pre-trained network successfully identified anomalies in the OOD dataset. Synthetic experiments confirmed that the GRF dataset enhances generalization compared to a homogeneous background OOD dataset. The network accurately recovered structures in a checkerboard resistivity model, and demonstrated robustness to noise, outperforming traditional gradient-based methods. Finally, the developed scheme is tested using exemplary field data from a waste site near Roorkee, India. The proposed scheme enhances generalization in a data-driven supervised learning framework, suggesting a promising direction for OOD generalization in DL methods.</description>

      <title>A steady-state frictional crack in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analogy between frictional cracks, propagating along interfaces in frictional contact, and ordinary cracks in bulk materials is important in various fields. We consider a stress-controlled frictional crack propagating at a velocity $c_{\rm r}$ along an interface separating two strips, each of height $H$, the frictional counterpart of the classical problem of a displacement-controlled crack in a strip, which played central roles in understanding material failure. We show that steady-state frictional cracks in a strip geometry require a nonmonotonic dependence of the frictional strength on the slip velocity and, in sharp contrast to their classical counterparts, feature a vanishing stress drop. Here, rupture is driven by energy flowing to its edge from behind, generated by an excess power of the external stress, and to be accompanied by an increase in the stored elastic energy, in qualitative contrast to the classical counterpart that is driven by the release of elastic energy stored ahead of the propagating edge. Finally, we derive a complete set of mesoscopic and macroscopic scaling relations for frictional cracks in a strip geometry and demonstrate that the stress singularity near their edges is proportional to $(\Delta{v}/c_{\rm r})\sqrt{H}$, where $\Delta{v}$ is the slip velocity rise accompanying their propagation.</description>

      <title>Application of Marchenko-based isolation to a land S-wave seismic dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The overburden structures often can distort the responses of the target region in seismic data, especially in land datasets. Ideally, all effects of the overburden and underburden structures should be removed, leaving only the responses of the target region. This can be achieved using the Marchenko method. The Marchenko method is capable of estimating Green's functions between the surface of the Earth and arbitrary locations in the subsurface. These Green's functions can then be used to redatum wavefields to a level in the subsurface. As a result, the Marchenko method enables the isolation of the response of a specific layer or package of layers, free from the influence of the overburden and underburden. In this study, we apply the Marchenko-based isolation technique to land S-wave seismic data acquired in the Groningen province, the Netherlands. We apply the technique for combined removal of the overburden and underburden, which leaves the isolated response of the target region which is selected between 30 m and 270 m depth. Our results indicate that this approach enhances the resolution of reflection data. These enhanced reflections can be utilised for imaging and monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>A reciprocity-aware, low-rank regularization for multidimensional deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel factorization-based, low-rank regularization method for solving multidimensional deconvolution problems in the frequency domain. In this approach, each frequency component of the unknown wavefield is represented as a complex-valued square matrix and approximated using the product of one rectangular matrix and its transpose. The benefit of such a parametrization is two-fold: first, the size of the unknown matrix is greatly reduced compared to that of the original wavefield of interest (and halved compared to conventional factorization-based, low-rank approximations); second, the retrieved wavefield is implicitly guaranteed to comply with the reciprocity principle, as expected from theory. We further show that the proposed objective function can be successfully optimized using the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm and discuss a robust strategy to define the initial guess of the solution. Numerical examples on synthetic and field data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in compressing the retrieved Green's function while preserving its accuracy.</description>

      <title>When data driven reduced order modeling meets full waveform inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveform inversion is concerned with estimating a heterogeneous medium, modeled by variable coefficients of wave equations, using sources that emit probing signals and receivers that record the generated waves. It is an old and intensively studied inverse problem with a wide range of applications, but the existing inversion methodologies are still far from satisfactory. The typical mathematical formulation is a nonlinear least squares data fit optimization and the difficulty stems from the non-convexity of the objective function that displays numerous local minima at which local optimization approaches stagnate. This pathological behavior has at least three unavoidable causes: (1) The mapping from the unknown coefficients to the wave field is nonlinear and complicated. (2) The sources and receivers typically lie on a single side of the medium, so only backscattered waves are measured. (3) The probing signals are band limited and with high frequency content. There is a lot of activity in the computational science and engineering communities that seeks to mitigate the difficulty of estimating the medium by data fitting. In this paper we present a different point of view, based on reduced order models (ROMs) of two operators that control the wave propagation. The ROMs are called data driven because they are computed directly from the measurements, without any knowledge of the wave field inside the inaccessible medium. This computation is non-iterative and uses standard numerical linear algebra methods. The resulting ROMs capture features of the physics of wave propagation in a complementary way and have surprisingly good approximation properties that facilitate waveform inversion.
  In this arxiv version two important typos are corrected when compared to the published version. The typo was in the second equation in Theorem 3 and carried over into Corollary 1. The proofs are correct.</description>
