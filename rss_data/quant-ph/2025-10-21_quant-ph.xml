      <title>Quantum Classical Correspondence Using Coherent State Measurements and Husimi Q Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and simulate a protocol to evolve a quantum particle forward in time such that its trajectory closely matches that of the particle's Newtonian counterpart. Using short bursts of Schr\"odinger time-evolution interleaved with positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) in the coherent basis, we demonstrate quantum-classical convergence for durations far beyond Schr\"odinger time-evolution alone. We examine the impact of the time between measurements $\Delta t$ and the reduced Planck's constant $\hbar$ on divergence time. Results indicate that for appropriate values of $\Delta t$, smaller values of $\hbar$ lead to longer divergence times. This method suggests a elegant, intuitive bridge to recover classical motion from quantum postulates.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in a U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory via Local Information Flows: Scattering and String Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce local information flows as a diagnostic tool for characterizing out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics in lattice gauge theories. We employ the information lattice framework, a local decomposition of total information into spatial- and scale-resolved contributions, to characterize the propagation and buildup of quantum correlations in real-time processes. Focusing on the Schwinger model, a canonical $(1+1)$-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory, we apply this framework to two scenarios. First, in the near-threshold scattering of two vector mesons, we demonstrate that the emergence of correlations at a longer length scale in the information lattice marks the production of heavier scalar mesons. Second, in the dynamics of electric field strings, we clearly distinguish between the confining regime, which evolves towards a steady state with a static correlation profile, and the string-breaking sector. The latter is characterized by dynamic correlation patterns that reflect the sequential formation and annihilation of strings. This information-centric approach provides a direct, quantitative, and interpretable visualization of complex many-body phenomena, offering a promising tool for analyzing dynamics in higher-dimensional gauge theories and experiments on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Efficient state estimation on quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two scalable and entanglement-free methods for estimating the collective state of an n-qubit quantum computer. The first method consists of a fixed set of five quantum circuits-regardless of the number of qubits-that avoid the use of entanglement as a measurement resource, relying instead on classical communication between selected pairs of qubits. The second method requires only 2n+1 circuits, each of which applies a single local gate to one of the n qubits during the measurement stage. Unlike traditional estimation methods, our approaches do not require any costly post-processing procedure to estimate a quantum state, enabling scalability to relatively large system sizes. We experimentally compare both methods on freely available IBM quantum processors, and observe how the state estimation varies with increasing number of qubits and shots. We further validated our results by estimating the 4-qubit entangled state of two remote ion-trap quantum processors, demonstrating that the optimized 2n+1 tomographic scheme achieves estimates consistent with standard methods while using exponentially fewer measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum State Preparation with Bucket Brigade QRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of data in quantum states is a critical component in the design of quantum algorithms. The cost of this step can significantly limit the realization of quantum advantage in domains such as machine learning, finance, and chemistry. One of the main approaches to achieve efficient state preparation is through the use of Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), a theoretical device for coherent data access with several proposed physical implementations. In this work, we present a framework that integrates the physical model of the Bucket Brigade QRAM (BBQRAM) with the classical data structure of the Segment Tree to achieve efficient state preparation. We introduce a memory layout that embeds a segment tree within BBQRAM memory cells by preserving the segment tree's hierarchy and supporting data retrieval in logarithmic time via specialized access primitives. We demonstrate that, under the proposed memory layout, our method encodes a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$ in a quantum register of $\Theta(\log_2(MN))$ qubits in $O(\log_2^2(MN))$ time using constant ancillary qubits under a fixed-precision assumption. We further illustrate the method through a numerical example. This framework provides theoretical support for quantum algorithms that assume negligible data loading overhead and establishes a foundation for designing classical-to-quantum encoding algorithms that are aware of the underlying physical QRAM architecture.</description>

      <title>Environment-imposed selection rules for nuclear-spin conversion of H$_2$ in molecular crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear-spin conversion in molecular hydrogen is governed by strict symmetry rules that typically require magnetic fields or catalytic surfaces to break. Here we demonstrate that the intrinsic tensor composition of a non-magnetic molecular crystal field can impose and relax these rules without external fields. High-resolution infrared spectra of H$_2$ in crystalline CO$_2$ reveal large rank-2 (quadrupolar) crystal-field splittings of the $m$ sublevels, while nuclear-spin conversion occurs only through $\Delta m = 0$ channels. Replacing CO$_2$ with polar N$_2$O introduces rank-1 (dipole) components that partially open $\Delta m \neq 0$ pathways, while incorporation of paramagnetic NO$_2$ fully lifts the restriction. These results establish a direct correspondence between crystal-field tensor rank and nuclear-spin dynamics, introducing a general symmetry-based framework for designing and controlling spin-isomer populations and quantum-state connectivity in molecular solids.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-free subspaces in the noisy dynamics of discrete-step quantum walks in a photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of periodically driven, discrete-step quantum walks in a one-dimensional photonic lattice. We find that in the bulk, temporal noise that is constant within a Floquet period leads to decoherence-free momentum subspaces, whereas fully random noise destroys coherence in a few time-steps. When considering topological edge states, we observe decoherence no matter the type of temporal noise. To explain these results, we derive a non-perturbative master equation to describe the system's dynamics and experimentally confirm our findings in a discrete mesh photonic lattice implemented in a double-fibre ring setup. Surprisingly, our results show that a class of bulk states can be more robust to a certain type of noise than topological edge states.</description>

      <title>Commuting Embeddings for Parallel Strategies in Non-local Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-local games (NLGs) provide a versatile framework for probing quantum correlations and for benchmarking the power of entanglement. In finite dimensions, the standard method for playing several games in parallel requires a tensor product of the local Hilbert spaces, which scales additively in the number of qubits. In this work, we show that this additive cost can be reduced by exploiting algebraic embeddings. We introduce two forms of compressions. First, when a referee selects one game from a finite collection of games at random, the game quantum strategy can be implemented using a maximally entangled state of dimension equal to the largest individual game, thereby eliminating the need for repeated state preparations. Second, we establish conditions under which several games can be played simultaneously in parallel on fewer qubits than the tensor product baseline. These conditions are expressed in terms of commuting embeddings of the game algebras. Moreover, we provide a constructive framework for building such embeddings. Using tools from Lie theory, we show that aligning the various game algebras into a common Cartan decomposition enables such a qubit reduction. Beyond the theoretical contribution, our framework casts NLGs as algebraic primitives for distributed and resource constrained quantum computations and suggested NLGs as a comparable device independent dimension witness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising area of research for enhancing the performance of classical machine learning systems by leveraging quantum computational principles. However, practical deployment of QML remains limited due to current hardware constraints such as limited number of qubits and quantum noise. This chapter introduces a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that combines the advantages of quantum computing with transfer learning techniques to address high-resolution image classification. Specifically, we propose a Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL) model that integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with quantum variational circuits. Through extensive simulations on diverse datasets including Ants \&amp; Bees, CIFAR-10, and Road Sign Detection, we demonstrate that QTL achieves superior classification performance compared to both conventional and quantum models trained without transfer learning. Additionally, we also investigate the model's vulnerability to adversarial attacks and demonstrate that incorporating adversarial training significantly boosts the robustness of QTL, enhancing its potential for deployment in security sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control of quantum photon-photon interaction with phase change material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interference can produce a pivotal effective photon-photon interaction, enabling the exploration of various quantum information technologies that beyond the possibilities of classical physics. While such an effective interaction is fundamentally limited to the bosonic nature of photons and the restricted phase responses from commonly used unitary optical elements, loss-induced nonunitary operation provides an alternative degree of freedom to control the quantum interference. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a concise yet powerful tool to unravel fundamental features of quantum interference based on the phase change material vanadium dioxide. Since the insulator-metal transition in an elaborate vanadium dioxide thin film can create any desired particle exchange phase response, we show its tunability over the effective photon-photon interaction between paired photons that are entangled in the symmetric and anti-symmetric forms, which may introduce sophisticated nonunitary operations and functionalities into programmable optical platforms. These results provide an alternative approach to investigate the quantum light-matter interaction, and facilitate the use of quantum interference for various quantum information processing tasks such as quantum simulation and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Coherence-Mediated Quantum Thermometry in a Hybrid Circuit-QED Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry plays a critical role in the development of low-temperature sensors and quantum information platforms. In this work, we propose and theoretically analyze a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture in which a superconducting qubit is dispersively coupled to two distinct bosonic modes: one initialized in a weak coherent state and the other coupled to a thermal environment. We show that the qubit serves as a sensitive readout of the probe mode, mapping the interference between thermal and coherent photon-number fluctuations onto measurable dephasing. This mechanism enables enhanced sensitivity to sub-millikelvin thermal energy fluctuations through Ramsey interferometry. We derive analytic expressions for the qubit coherence envelope, compute the quantum Fisher information for temperature estimation, and demonstrate numerically that the presence of a coherent reference amplifies the qubit's sensitivity to small changes in thermal photon occupancy. Our results establish a new paradigm for quantum-enhanced thermometry and provide a scalable platform for future calorimetric sensing in high-energy physics and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Origin of Diffraction from Bright and Dark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction, a cornerstone of wave optics, is reinterpreted through bright and dark collective states. In the continuous-mode framework, the diffraction pattern arises from projection onto a single bright mode, while dark-region photons populate orthogonal dark modes. Unlike the classical view of destructive interference as field cancellation, the quantum description shows photons persisting in detector-uncoupled states. Our approach thus resolves a key limitation of Glauber's theory by identifying the detectable and undetectable modes, offering a complete particle-based explanation for diffraction.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of frequency-entangled biphoton states facilitated by cavity polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regime. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how polariton/bipolariton interaction with the entangled photon pair modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We argue that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity steady state.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Brownian SYK-Hubbard Model: from Spectral Function to Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of complex correlations in strongly interacting systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. One fruitful approach is to develop solvable toy models that encapsulate universal properties shared by realistic systems. In this work, we introduce the Brownian SYK-Hubbard model, which combines the all-to-all random interactions of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with on-site Hubbard-type interactions. This hybrid construction enables the study of the interplay between nonlocal random dynamics and local correlation effects: (1) As the interaction strength increases, the single-particle spectrum exhibits a transition from a single peak to a two-peak structure, signaling the onset of Mottness. (2) The spectral form factor undergoes a sequence of dynamical transitions as the evolution time increases before reaching the plateau in the long-time limit under strong Hubbard interactions. (3) The out-of-time-order correlator is computed by summing a series of modified ladder diagrams, which determines the quantum Lyapunov exponent and reveals a violation of the bound on branching time. Our results establish a new analytically tractable platform for exploring the effects of Hubbard interactions in chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Circuit Optimization is co-NQP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing resources remain scarce and error rates high, minimizing the resource consumption of quantum circuits is essential for achieving practical quantum advantage. Here we consider the natural problem of, given a circuit $C$, computing an equivalent circuit $C'$ that minimizes a quantum resource type, expressed as the count or depth of (i) arbitrary gates, or (ii) non-Clifford gates, or (iii) superposition gates, or (iv) entanglement gates. We show that, when $C$ is expressed over any gate set that can implement the H and TOF gates exactly, each of the above optimization problems is hard for $\text{co-NQP}$, and hence outside the Polynomial Hierarchy, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. This strengthens recent results in the literature which established an $\text{NP}$-hardness lower bound, and tightens the gap to the corresponding $\text{NP}^\text{NQP}$ upper bound known for cases (i)-(iii) over Clifford+T and (i)-(iv) over H+TOF circuits.</description>

Abstract: The quantization of particle trajectories gives rise to remarkable features such as the coherent superposition of quantum channels and the quantum switch, which offer significant advantages in the communication of both classical and quantum information. In this study, we investigate the classical and quantum capacities of various supermaps, including individual quantum switches, coherent superpositions of channels, their combinations, and hybrid superpositions. A comparative analysis of these configurations reveals the scenarios in which specific combinations yield enhanced communication advantages.</description>

      <title>Triphoton generation near atomic resonance via SSWM: Harmonic expansion for accurate optical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations of time-frequency-entangled photon pairs generated via parametric processes are critically influenced by both the linear and nonlinear optical responses of the medium. This sensitivity is especially significant in schemes utilizing atomic ensembles with well-defined energy level structures near resonance. However, conventional theoretical approaches often fall short in accurately calculating the optical responses--particularly when a single atomic transition is simultaneously driven by multiple light fields with (significantly) different intensities. To address this limitation, we generalize the harmonic expansion method originally introduced by Wen for biphoton generation near atomic resonance. As a case study, we apply this generalized approach to the reliable direct generation of time-energy-entangled W-state triphotons via spontaneous six-wave mixing in a five-level asymmetric-M atomic system. Our results demonstrate the method's superior accuracy and self-consistency, offering clear advantages over traditional calculation techniques.</description>

      <title>Temporal-order-driven asymmetric quantum interference and temporal coherence enhancement in spontaneous six-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow-band multiphoton entanglement sources serve as a core enabling resource for advanced quantum information technologies. Recently, researchers have directly generated energy-time entangled triphoton W states in a hot atomic medium via spontaneous six-wave mixing for the first time. However, a rigorous theoretical framework for this process remains lacking to date, confining our understanding to a mere extension of the biphoton model. Here, we analytically investigate the generation mechanism of energy-time entangled triphotons and their classically controllable optical properties in an electromagnetically induced transparency-assisted five-level cold atomic system. Notably, triphoton generation follows strict temporal ordering, resulting in asymmetric quantum interference in triple coincidence counts--unreplicable and unexplainable by the inherently symmetric biphoton model. These results establish a rigorous physical framework for spontaneous six-wave mixing-generated triphotons, clarify their distinctions from states produced via cascaded nonlinear models, and substantially advance their utility in quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>A necessary and sufficient condition for genuinely entangled n-qubit states with six non-zero coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Science 340, 1205, 7 June (2013)], via polytopes Michael Walter et al. proposed a sufficient condition detecting the genuinely entangled pure states. In this paper, assume that a state with six non-zero coefficients is not a trivially separable state. Then the state is separable if and only if its six basis states consist of the three partially complementary pairs and the corresponding coefficient matrix has proportional rows. The contrapositive of this result reads that the state is genuinely entangled if and only if its six basis states do not consist of the three partially complementary pairs or though the six basis states consist of the three partially complementary pairs, the corresponding coefficient matrix does not have proportional rows. We propose four corresponding coefficient 2 by 3 matrices and show that if the four coefficient matrices don't have proportional rows, then the state is genuinely entangled. It is trivial to know if two rows of a 2 by 3 coefficient matrix are proportional. The difference from the previous articles is that the structure of the basis states is used to detect entanglement in this paper. One can see that Osterloh and Siewert's states of five and six qubits are genuinely entangled because two rows for any one of the four corresponding coefficient 2 by 3 matrices are not proportional. These states were distinguished as the maximal entangled states by the complicated filters before.

      <title>Quantum Complexity in Constrained Many-Body Models: Scars, Fragmentation, and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic constraints in quantum many-body systems give rise to quantum states, whose behavior strongly depends on the choice of initial conditions. In recent years, these systems have drawn increasing interest because they provide insight into the mechanisms of thermalization and the situations where it can fail. In this work, we study a family of kinetically constrained models, including the celebrated Quantum Game of Life, from the perspective of quantum complexity, with a focus on entanglement, nonstabilizerness, and signatures of quantum chaos. By applying spectral diagnostics such as level statistics and spectral form factors, we demonstrate that these models show robust chaotic behavior while also supporting Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scar states. Remarkably, we find that even certain symmetry-resolved fragmented sectors can themselves host scarred eigenstates, highlighting the unexpected coexistence of chaos, scars, and fragmentation within the same family of Hamiltonians. To better understand these fragmented subspaces, we further characterize them using their quantum resource generation ability. In particular, we demonstrate that characterization of entanglement and the ability to generate nonstabilizerness can be instrumental in distinguishing different dynamically disconnected sectors.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon equation within the real Hilbert space formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within this article one finds the statement of the Klein-Gordon problem within the real Hilbert space formalism ($\mathbbm R$HS) in terms of complex wave functions, and in terms of quaternionic wave functions as well. The complex formulation comprises hermitian and non-hermitian cases, while the quaternionic solutions additionally set in motion self-interacting particles. The non-hermitian cases comprise non-conservative processes, while the self-interaction physically implies the increase of the effective mass of the particle, an effect that cannot be reproduced using a complex wave function. The obtained autonomous particle solutions, as well as the Klein problem agree to the previously discovered self-interacting non-relativistic particle, and thus reinforce $\mathbbm R$HS as viable and consistent way to explore open problems in quantum mechanics. Also important, the negative energy problem that plagues the usual formalism is eliminated within this approach.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a 3-Wave Mixing Element with Quantum Paraelectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At cryogenic temperatures and microwave frequencies, the perovskite crystals strontium titanate (STO) and potassium tantalate (KTO) have large, tunable permittivity arising from a quantum paraelectric phase. As such, these materials hold promise as a platform to realize compact, variable capacitance elements for use in quantum devices. From modulating this capacitance, we propose the development of a parametric mixing element: a quantum paraelectric nonlinear dielectric amplifier (PANDA). We calculate that a PANDA made from a nanofabricated parallel plate capacitor and realistic design constraints can demonstrate a three-wave mixing strength of order MHz, in comparison to an effective Kerr strength of sub-Hz. This suggests excellent performance as a three-wave mixing element, with high compression power in analogy to superconducting parametric amplifiers based on kinetic inductance. Beyond parametric amplifiers, we predict that compact, tunable capacitors based on STO, KTO, and related materials can enable a wide class of cryogenic quantum circuits including novel filters, switches, circulators, and qubits.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fusion of Qudit Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize a generalized type-II fusion operation for qudit cluster states within linear optics. Two designated qudits, one from each input cluster, interfere with optional ancilla qudits via a passive linear-optical network, followed by number-resolving detection; conditioned on %a two-click outcome, measurement outcome, the remaining qudits form the post-selected fused state. We prove a general rank bound: for any such interferometer and outcome, the reduced density matrix across the two parent clusters has Schmidt rank at most $M$, the total number of measured qudits including ancillae. Consequently, a correct qudit fusion which requires rank $d$ is impossible without ancillae and requires at least $d-2$ ancilla qudits. Our analysis extends previous no-go results for Bell-type qubit fusion to the qudit setting and to generalized, non-Bell projections. We analyze the probabilities and entanglement of the relevant measurement outcomes, and discuss how our lower bound aligns with existing constructive schemes. These results set a clear resource threshold for high-dimensional, fusion-based photonic MBQC.</description>

      <title>QRTlib: A Library for Fast Quantum Real Transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-valued transforms such as the discrete cosine, sine, and Hartley transforms play a central role in classical computing, complementing the Fourier transform in applications from signal and image processing to data compression. However, their quantum counterparts have not evolved in parallel, and no unified framework exists for implementing them efficiently on quantum hardware. This article addresses this gap by introducing QRTlib, a library for fast and practical implementations of quantum real transforms, including the quantum Hartley, cosine, and sine transforms of various types. We develop new algorithms and circuit optimizations that make these transforms efficient and suitable for near-term devices. In particular, we present a quantum Hartley transform based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) technique, achieving a fourfold reduction in circuit size compared to prior methods, and an improved quantum sine transform of Type I that removes large multi-controlled operations. We also introduce circuit-level optimizations, including two's-complement and or-tree constructions. QRTlib provides the first complete implementations of these quantum real transforms in Qiskit.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermometric sensing: Local vs. Remote approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry leveraging quantum sensors is investigated with an emphasis on fundamental precision bounds derived from quantum estimation theory. The proposed sensing platform consists of two dissimilar qubits coupled via capacitor, which induce quantum oscillations in the presence of a thermal environment. Thermal equilibrium states are modeled using the Gibbs distribution. The precision limits are assessed through the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the Hilbert-Schmidt Speed (HSS), serving as stringent criteria for sensor sensitivity. Systematic analysis of the dependence of QFI and HSS on tunable parameters -such as qubit energies and coupling strengths- provides optimization pathways for maximizing temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, we explore two distinct quantum thermometry paradigms: (I) local temperature estimation directly performed by Alice, who possesses the quantum sensor interfacing with the thermal bath, and (II) remote temperature estimation conducted by Bob, facilitated via quantum teleportation. In the latter scenario, temperature information encoded in the qubit state is transmitted through a single-qubit quantum thermal teleportation protocol. Our findings indicate that direct measurement yields superior sensitivity compared to remote estimation, primarily due to the inherent advantage of direct sensor-environment interaction. The analysis reveals that increasing Josephson energies diminishes sensor sensitivity, whereas augmenting the mutual coupling strength between the qubits enhances it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As atom-cavity systems are becoming more sophisticated, the limitations of the Jaynes-Cummings model are becoming more apparent. In this paper, we therefore take a more dynamical approach to the modelling of atom-cavity systems and do not reduce the electromagnetic field inside the resonator to a single mode. Our approach shows that the decay rate Gamma_cav of an emitter inside a subwavelength cavity with metallic mirrors can be much larger than its free space decay rate Gamma_free due to constructive interference effects of the emitted light. In general, however, we find that Gamma_cav = Gamma_free to a very good approximation which might explain why many atom-cavity experiments have not been able to operate in the so-called strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>High-performance quantum frequency conversion using programmable unpoled nanophotonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is essential for interfacing quantum systems operating at different wavelengths and for realizing scalable quantum networks. Despite extensive progress, achieving QFC with simultaneous high efficiency, low pump power, minimal added noise, broad bandwidth, and pump-wavelength flexibility remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient, low-noise, and bidirectional QFC between the telecom (1550-nm) and visible (780-nm) bands using unpoled indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) $\chi^{(2)}$ nanophotonic waveguides, eliminating the need for a long-wavelength pump. Leveraging the large nonlinear susceptibility of InGaP together with programmable modal-phase-matching control, we obtain record-low pump power (20 mW) -- an order of magnitude lower than that in previous demonstrations using integrated thin-film waveguides -- with record-high loss-inclusive normalized conversion efficiency among non-resonant QFC implementations. With added noise well below the single-photon level, our platform preserves the quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons. These results mark a significant advance in integrated nonlinear photonics for high-performance QFC, facilitating the development of versatile and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Detuning-Induced Systematic Errors in Entanglement-Enhanced Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing leverages non-classical resources to enhance precision. In particular, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can, in principle, attain the Heisenberg limit that surpasses the standard quantum limit. While many studies have examined how open-system noise-typically modeled with Lindblad master equations-degrades GHZ-based metrology, coherent control imperfections during state preparation and readout have received less attention. Here, we analyze the effect of detuning between actual and nominal spin frequencies in a GHZ-state preparation scheme employing a frequency selective pulse. We show that detuning induces coherent, systematic error that prevents GHZ sensing from reaching the Heisenberg limit. To mitigate this effect, we design a composite-pulse protocol that compensates for detuning-induced errors and improves the sensitivity under the effect of coherent error.</description>

Abstract: Weak quantum measurements enable real-time tracking and control of dynamical quantum systems, producing quantum trajectories -- evolutions of the quantum state of the system conditioned on measurement outcomes. For classical systems, the accuracy of trajectories can be improved by incorporating future information, a procedure known as smoothing. Here we apply this concept to quantum systems, generalising a formalism of quantum state smoothing for an observer monitoring a quantum system exposed to environmental decoherence, a scenario important for many quantum information protocols. This allows future data to be incorporated when reconstructing the trajectories of quantum states. We experimentally demonstrate that smoothing improves accuracy using a continuously measured nanomechanical resonator, showing that the method compensates for both gaps in the measurement record and inaccessible environments. We further observe a key predicted departure from classical smoothing: quantum noise renders the trajectories nondifferentiable. These results establish that future information can enhance quantum trajectory reconstruction, with potential applications across quantum sensing, control, and error correction.</description>

      <title>Successive generation of nontrivial Riemann zeros from a Wu-Sprung type potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of numerical experiments are performed, where a symmetric potential is generated for the 1D time-independent Schr\"odinger equation, with an eigenspectrum that matches the imaginary part of the first nontrivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function. The potential is generated as a series of correction functions, where the starting point is a potential that matches the smooth Riemann -- von Mangoldt approximation. It is found that the correction functions display a clear pattern that can be explained in simple terms, almost entirely dependent on the approximation error in the Riemann -- von Mangoldt formula. This also provides an explanation for the fractal pattern in the potential that was observed by Wu and Sprung.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithms for Computing (Coarse) Correlated Equilibria of General-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing Nash equilibria of zero-sum games in classical and quantum settings is extensively studied. For general-sum games, computing Nash equilibria is PPAD-hard and the computing of a more general concept called correlated equilibria has been widely explored in game theory. In this paper, we initiate the study of quantum algorithms for computing $\varepsilon$-approximate correlated equilibria (CE) and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) in multi-player normal-form games. Our approach utilizes quantum improvements to the multi-scale Multiplicative Weight Update (MWU) method for CE calculations, achieving a query complexity of $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ for fixed $\varepsilon$. For CCE, we extend techniques from quantum algorithms for zero-sum games to multi-player settings, achieving query complexity $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^{2.5})$. Both algorithms demonstrate a near-optimal scaling in the number of players $m$ and actions $n$, as confirmed by our quantum query lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Reduction Techniques for Quantum Graph Colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient quantum computing method for reducing special graphs in the context of the graph coloring problem. The special graphs considered include both symmetric and non-symmetric graphs where the axis passes through nodes only, edges only, and both together. The presented method reduces the number of coloring matrices, which is important for realization of the number of quantum states required, from $K^{N}$ to $K^{\frac{N+m}{2}}$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes, where $K$ is the number of colours required and \emph{N} being total number of nodes. Similarly for other types also, the number of quantum states is reduced. The complexity in the number of qubits has been reduced by $\delta C_q= \frac{9N^2}{8}-\frac{3m^2}{8}-\frac{3Nm}{4}-\frac{N}{4}+\frac{m}{4}$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs, symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes and other types as presented in the paper. Additionally, the number of gates and number of iterations are reduced massively compared to state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Like for a graph with 20 nodes and symmetric line passing through 2 nodes, the number of iterations decreased from 5157 to 67. Therefore, the procedure presented for solving the graph coloring problem now requires a significantly reduced number of qubits compared to before. The run time of the proposed algorithm for these special type of graphs are reduced from $O(1.9575^{N})$ to $O(1.9575^{(\frac{N+m}{2})})$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes and similarly for others cases.</description>

      <title>Phase gadget compilation of quantum circuits using multiqubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis and compilation are critical components in the quantum computing stack, both for contemporary quantum systems, where efficient use of limited resources is essential, as well as for large-scale fault-tolerant platforms, where computation time can be minimized. The specific characteristics of the quantum hardware determine which circuit designs and optimizations are feasible. We present a phase-gadget based method for compilation of quantum circuits using programmable multiqubit entangling gates, that are native, among others, to trapped-ions quantum computers. We use phase-gadgets in order to generically reduce circuit depths and efficiently implement them with few, high-fidelity, multiqubit gates. We test our methods on a large set of benchmark circuits and demonstrate generic circuit depth reduction and implementation error reduction.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cram\'er-Rao bound for Quantum Bayes-Point Estimation with Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid framework for quantum parameter estimation in the presence of nuisance parameters. In this Bayes-point scheme, the parameters of interest are treated as fixed non-random parameters while nuisance parameters are integrated out with respect to a prior (random parameters). Within this setting, we introduce the hybrid partial quantum Fisher information matrix (hpQFIM), defined by prior-averaging the nuisance block of the QFIM and taking a Schur complement, and derive a corresponding Cram\'er-Rao-type lower bound on the hybrid risk. We establish structural properties of the hpQFIM, including inequalities that bracket it between computationally tractable surrogates, as well as limiting behaviors under extreme priors. Operationally, the hybrid approach improves over pure point estimation since the optimal measurement for the parameters of interest depends only on the prior distribution of the nuisance, rather than on its unknown value. We illustrate the framework with analytically solvable qubit models and numerical examples, clarifying how partial prior information on nuisance variables can be systematically exploited in quantum metrology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state phases of the one-dimensional quantum contact process model with local dissipation. Exploiting the single-site and cluster mean-field approximations, we show the bistability of the absorbing and active phases in the system with strong interaction between neighboring sites, accompanied by the closing of the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover we find that, near the transition point, the system may evolve first to the long-lived metastable state before reaching the eventual steady state, suggesting us to prolong the time-evolution in the numerical simulation to find the true steady state. We also present the extrapolated transition point by systematically including the correlations in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a leading technology for enabling information-theoretic secure communication, with protocols such as BB84 and its variants already deployed in practical field implementations. As QKD evolves from point-to-point links to multi-node networks, scalability and cost-effectiveness become central challenges. Among the approaches to address these issues, efficient-BB84 has shown durable and reliable performances, while optical switching techniques enable flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient integration of QKD into existing infrastructures. In this work, we present an active QKD network in a production environment, employing efficient-BB84 and optical switching, orchestrated in a coordinated manner, emphasizing their potential to support robust, future-proof quantum-secure communication systems.</description>

      <title>Countermeasures for Trojan-Horse Attacks on self-compensating all-fiber polarization modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to exchange a secret key between two parties. Unlike classical cryptographic systems, the security of QKD is not reliant on computational assumptions but is instead rooted in the fundamental laws of physics. In a QKD protocol, any attempt by an eavesdropper to intercept the key is detectable: this provides an unprecedented level of security, making QKD an attractive solution for secure communication in an era increasingly threatened by the advent of quantum computers and their potential to break classical cryptographic systems. However, QKD also faces several practical challenges such as transmission loss and noise in quantum channels, finite key size effects, and implementation flaws in QKD devices. Addressing these issues is crucial for the large-scale deployment of QKD and the realization of a global quantum internet. A whole body of research is dedicated to the hacking of the quantum states source, for example using Trojan-Horse attacks (THAs), where the eavesdropper injects light into the system and analyzes the back-reflected signal. In this paper, we study the vulnerabilities against THAs of the iPOGNAC encoder, first introduced in Avesani, Agnesi et al., to propose adapted countermeasures that can mitigate such attacks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate methods to broadcast timing information from a central clock to all other clocks by the use of multipartite entanglement. This task is a necessary step in establishing a coordinated universal time, currently performed using classical synchronization methods. Using an entanglement-based method has the advantage that the timing results are independent of the intervening medium. We generalize existing bipartite quantum clock synchronization methods and take special care to address issues of different phase conventions being adopted at each node (the ``Preskill phase problem''). Using supersinglet purification, we show that this allows for a scalable method with a time signal that is a constant with respect to the number of nodes.</description>

      <title>Parameter Analysis and Optimization of Layer Fidelity for Quantum Processor Benchmarking at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continued scaling of quantum processors, holistic benchmarks are essential for extensively evaluating device performance. Layer fidelity is a benchmark well-suited to assessing processor performance at scale. Key advantages of this benchmark include its natural alignment with randomized benchmarking (RB) procedures, crosstalk awareness, fast measurements over large numbers of qubits, high signal-to-noise ratio, and fine-grained information. In this work, we extend the analysis of the original layer fidelity manuscript to optimize parameters of the benchmark and extract deeper insights of its application. We present a robust protocol for identifying optimal qubit chains of length N, demonstrating that our method yields error per layered gate (EPLG) values 40%-70% lower than randomly selected chains. We further establish layer fidelity as an effective performance monitoring tool, capturing both edge-localized and device-wide degradation by tracking optimal chains of length 50 and 100, and fixed chains of length 100. Additionally, we refine error analysis by proposing parameter bounds on the number of randomizations and Clifford lengths used in direct RB fits, minimizing fit uncertainties. Finally, we analyze the impact of varying gate durations on layer fidelity measurements, showing that prolonged gate times leading to idling times significantly increase layered two-qubit (2Q) errors on Eagle R3 processors. Notably, we observe a 95% EPLG increase on a fixed chain in an Eagle R3 processor when some gate durations are extended by 65%. These findings extend the applicability of the layer fidelity benchmark and provide practical guidelines for optimizing quantum processor evaluations.</description>

      <title>Single-letter Chain Rule for Quantum Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative entropy is the standard measure of distinguishability in classical and quantum information theory. In the classical case, its loss under channels admits an exact chain rule, while in the quantum case only asymptotic, regularized chain rules are known. We establish new chain rules for quantum relative entropy that apply already in the single-copy regime. The first inequality is obtained via POVM decompositions, extending the point distributions in the classical chain rule to quantum ensemble partitions. The second gives a sufficient condition for the most natural extension of the classical result, which uses projectors as a analog for the classical point distributions. We additionally find a semiclassical chain rule where the point distributions are replaced with the projectors of the initial states, and, finally, we find a relation to previous works on strengthened data processing inequalities and recoverability. These results show that meaningful chain inequalities are possible already at the single-copy level, but they also highlight that tighter bounds remain to be found.</description>

      <title>28 GHz Wireless Channel Characterization for a Quantum Computer Cryostat at 4 Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of quantum computing systems is constrained by the wiring complexity and thermal load introduced by dense wiring for control, readout and synchronization at cryogenic temperatures. To address this challenge, we explore the feasibility of wireless communication within a cryostat for a multi-core quantum computer, focusing on wireless channel characterization at cryogenic temperatures. We propose to place on-chip differential dipole antennas within the cryostat, designed to operate at 28 GHz in temperatures as low as 4 K. We model the antennas inside a realistic cryostat and, using full-wave electromagnetic simulations, we analyze impedance matching, spatial field distribution, and energy reverberation due to metallic structures. The wireless channel is characterized through measured channel impulse response (CIR) across multiple receiver antenna positions. The results demonstrate potential for reliable shortrange communication with high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and limited sensitivity to positional variation, at the cost of nonnegligible delay spread, due to significant multipath effects.</description>

      <title>Fractatomic Physics: An Invitation with Atomic Stability and Rydberg States in Fractal Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the physical quantum properties of atoms in fractal spaces, both as a theoretical generalization of normal integer-dimensional Euclidean spaces and as an experimentally realizable setting. We identify the threshold of fractality at which Ehrenfest atomic instability emerges, where the Schr\"{o}dinger equation describing the wave-function of a single electron orbiting around an atom becomes scale-free, and discuss the potential of observing this phenomena in laboratory settings. We then study the Rydberg states of stable atoms using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation, along with a proposed extension for the Langer modification, in general fractal dimensionalities. We show that fractal space atoms near instability explode in size even at low-number excited state, making them highly suitable to induce strong entanglements and foster long-range many-body interactions. We argue that atomic physics in fractal spaces -- ``fractatomic physics'' -- is a rich research avenue deserving of further theoretical and experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Modified Langevin noise formalism for multiple quantum emitters in dispersive electromagnetic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of interactions among quantum emitters through nanophotonic structures offers significant potential for quantum technologies. However, a rigorous theoretical description of the interaction of multiple quantum emitters with complex dispersive dielectric objects remains highly challenging. Here we introduce an approach based on the modified Langevin noise formalism that unveils the roles of both the noise polarization currents of the dielectrics and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field scattered by the dielectrics. This extends Refs. \cite{miano_quantum_2025}, \cite{miano_spectral_2025} to the general case of an arbitrary number of emitters. The proposed approach allows us to describe the dynamics of the quantum emitters for arbitrary initial quantum states of the electromagnetic environment consisting of two independent bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density matrix. Understanding how these reservoirs shape emitter dynamics is crucial to understanding light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments and to enhancing intrinsic emitter properties in structured environments.</description>

      <title>Preserving quantum coherence in thermal noisy systems via qubit frequency modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence is a key resource underpinning quantum technologies, yet it is highly susceptible to environmental decoherence, especially in thermal settings. While frequency modulation (FM) has shown promise in preserving coherence at zero temperature, its effectiveness in realistic, noisy thermal environments remains unclear. In this work, we investigate a single frequency-modulated qubit interacting with a thermal phase-covariant reservoir composed of dissipative and dephasing channels. We demonstrate that FM significantly preserves coherence in the presence of thermal dissipation while being ineffective under thermal pure-dephasing noise due to commutation between system and interaction Hamiltonians. When both noise channels are present, FM offers protection only for weak dephasing coupling. Our findings clarify the limitations and potential of FM-based coherence protection under thermal noise, supplying practical insights into designing robust quantum systems for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Phase sensitivity of lossy Mach-Zehnder interferometer via photon addition operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon addition operations applied to squeezed states have been shown to significantly enhance phase sensitivity. In this study, we extend this approach by applying photon addition not only to coherent states but also within a Mach--Zehnder interferometer setup, using coherent and squeezed vacuum states as input. Both intensity-difference and homodyne detection are used to evaluate photon addition schemes, and their phase sensitivities are compared under ideal and lossy conditions, respectively. We also analyze the quantum Fisher information of these two schemes. Results show both schemes improve phase sensitivity, quantum Fisher information, and loss resistance. In particular, photon addition within the interferometer performs better. Homodyne detection outperforms intensity difference detection under photon losses. Notably, each scheme has different parameter dependencies, making them suitable for different application scenarios. When the squeezing parameter is small, photon addition employed at the coherent input with intensity difference detection can approach the Heisenberg limit in ideal conditions and can exceed the standard quantum limit in high-loss conditions. Our proposed scheme represents a valuable method for quantum precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Resource efficient certification of system environment entanglement solely from reduced system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying nonclassical correlations typically requires access to all subsystems, presenting a major challenge in open quantum systems coupled to inaccessible environments. Recent works have shown that, in autonomous pure dephasing scenarios, quantum discord with the environment can be certified from system-only dynamics via the Hamiltonian ensemble formulation. However, this approach leaves open whether stronger correlations, such as entanglement, can be certified. Moreover, its reliance on Fourier analysis requires full-time dynamics, which is experimentally resource-intensive and provides limited information about when such correlations are established during evolution. In this work, we present a method that enables the certification of system-environment quantum entanglement solely from the reduced dynamics of the system. The method is based on the theory of mixed-unitary channels and applies to general non-autonomous pure dephasing scenarios. Crucially, it relaxes the need for full-time dynamics, offering a resource-efficient approach that also reveals the precise timing of entanglement generation. We experimentally validate this method on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum processor with a controlled-dephasing model. Finally, we highlight its potential as a tool for certifying gravitationally induced entanglement.</description>

      <title>Kinetically-induced bound states in a frustrated Rydberg tweezer array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how particles bind into composite objects is a ubiquitous theme in physics, from the formation of molecules to hadrons in quantum chromodynamics and the pairing of charge carriers in superconductors. The formation of bound states usually originates from attractive interactions between particles. However, the binding can also arise purely from the motion of dopants due to kinetic frustration, which is potentially related to unconventional pairing in moir\'e materials. Here, we report the first direct observation of kinetically-induced bound states between holes and magnons using a Rydberg atom array quantum simulator of the bosonic $t$-$J$ model in frustrated ladders and 2D lattices. First, we demonstrate the formation of mobile one-hole-one-magnon bound states. We then construct three-particle one-hole-two-magnon bound states and reveal the underlying binding mechanism by observing kinetically-induced singlet correlations. Finally, we investigate how mobile dopants structure their magnetic environment in a spin-balanced 2D triangular lattice, showing that a hole induces $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order, while a doublon dopant generates in-plane ferromagnetic correlations. Our results demonstrates compelling evidence of kinetically-induced binding, opening a new avenue to understand novel pairing mechanisms in correlated quantum materials like superconductors in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Double electron resonance with two ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely used in the development of a number of sensors. The sensitivity of these devices is limited by both the number of centers used and their coherent properties. While the effects on the coherent properties of paramagnetic impurities such as carbon 13-isotopes and p1 centers are rather well understood, the mutual interaction of NV centers, which becomes especially important in relatively dense NV ensembles, is less well understood. Here, we provide a systematic study of NV-NV interaction using a dynamical double electron-electron resonance sequence, making it possible to directly observe the interaction of NV centers. Two types of dynamical DEER sequences were considered, consisting of 3 and 4 pulses. The nature of the phase jump in the 3-pulse sequence was attributed to the effect of non-commuting rotations within the sequence. Both the phase of the state vector rotation and its amplitude decay were studied, thus presenting a complete picture of decoherence due to NV-NV interaction. It was shown that the rate of the state vector decay differed significantly from predictions for a spin 1/2 system. However, the decay rate observed in the DEER sequence remained a reliable indicator of the concentration of bath spins and could be used to measure NV center concentration, provided that the magnetic transition of NV centers is saturated.</description>

      <title>Real critical exponents from the $\varepsilon$-expansion in an interacting $U(1)$ model with non-Hermitian $Z_4$ anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum optics and condensed matter physics non-Hermitian phenomena are often studied under the assumption of an open physical system. However, there are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\mathcal{PT}$ (parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a $U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric $Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Error-correcting codes and absolutely maximally entangled states for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major difficulty in quantum computation is the ability to implement fault tolerant computations, protecting information against undesired interactions with the environment. Stabiliser codes were introduced as a means to protect information when storing or applying computations in Hilbert spaces where the local dimension is fixed, i.e. in Hilbert spaces of the form $({\mathbb C}^D)^{\otimes n}$. If $D$ is a prime power then one can consider stabiliser codes over finite fields \cite{KKKS2006}, which allows a deeper mathematical structure to be used to develop stabiliser codes. However, there is no practical reason that the subsystems should have the same local dimension and in this article we introduce a stabiliser formalism for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. of the form ${\mathbb C}^{D_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbb C}^{D_n}$. More generally, we define and prove a Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes of mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces. We redefine entanglement measures for these Hilbert spaces and follow \cite{HESG2018} and define absolutely maximally entangled states as states which maximise this entanglement measure. We provide examples of absolutely maximally entangled states in spaces of dimensions not previously known to have absolutely maximally entangled states.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness as a Diagnostic of Criticality and Exceptional Points in Non-Hermitian Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' to understand criticality and exceptional points in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems. Our focus is on parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric spin chains, specifically the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising and XX models. We calculate stabilizer R\'enyi entropies in their ground states using non-Hermitian matrix product state methods. Our findings show that magic exhibits unique and model-specific signs of phase transitions. In the Ising chain, it peaks along the regular Hermitian-like critical line but disappears across exceptional points. In contrast, in the XX chain, it reaches its maximum at the exceptional line where $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is broken. Finite-size scaling reveals that these effects become more pronounced with larger systems, highlighting non-stabilizerness as a sensitive marker for both quantum criticality and non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies. We also investigate magic in momentum space for the XX model analytically and find that is reaches a minimum around exceptional points. Our results indicate that magic takes extremal values at the exceptional points and serves as a valuable tool for examining complexity, criticality, and symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Long-distance distribution of atom-photon entanglement based on a cavity-free cold atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a quantum memory node with the ability of long-distance atom-photon distribution is the essential task for future quantum networks, enabling distributed quantum computing, quantum cryptography and remote sensing. Here we report the demonstration of a quantum-network node with a simple cavity-free cold atomic ensemble. This node gives an initial retrieval efficiency of approximately 50\% and memory lifetime of 160 $\mu$s for atomic qubits. With the aid of a high-efficiency and polarization-independent quantum frequency conversion (QFC) module, the generated entangled photon in the node at 780-nm wavelength is converted to telecom S band at 1522 nm, enabling atom-photon distribution over long distance. We observe an entanglement fidelity between the atoms and telecom photon exceeding 80\% after photon transmission over 20-km fiber, the remaining infidelity being dominated by atomic decoherence. The low-noise QFC with an external efficiency up to 48.5\% gives a signal-to-noise-ratio of 6.9 for transmitted photons with fiber length up to 100 km, laying the cornerstone for entanglement distribution at a hundred-km level. This result provides a new platform towards the realization of a long-distance quantum network.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the 'smooth gate', an entangling method for trapped-ion qubits where residual spin-motion entanglement errors are adiabatically eliminated by ramping the gate detuning. We demonstrate electronically controlled two-qubit gates with an estimated error of $8.4(7)\times10^{-5}$ without ground-state cooling. We further show that the error remains $\lesssim 5\times10^{-4}$ for ions with average phonon occupation up to $\bar{n}=9.4(3)$ on the gate mode. These results indicate that trapped-ion quantum computation can achieve high fidelity at temperatures above the Doppler limit, which enables faster and simpler device operation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d{-}1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p{+}1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d{-}p{-}2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. On the symmetry-invariant subspace, $\mathcal{U}$ is well-defined and unitary, and the coupled Hamiltonian is obtained from the decoupled one by conjugation with $\mathcal{U}$. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product, symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the bipartite entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. The framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the factorization, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Tagged vector space, Part I: Dirac notation as originally intended</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization is provided for the notion of tags, as used in various formulations of physical scenarios. It leads to the definition of tagged vector spaces, based on a set of axioms for tags and their extractors. As an application, such a tagged vector space is used to provide, in the context of quantum optics, a formal mathematical description for the Dirac notation that is closer to its intended usage compared to current mathematical formulations: it provides a one-to-one mapping between kets and bras and allows operators to operate either to the left or to the right. The canonical commutation relations for the quadrature and ladder operators are derived as consequences of the axioms of the tagged vector space. These axioms also lead to a symplectic phase space with the Wigner function and the Weyl transform emerging naturally.</description>

      <title>Phase estimation via photon subtraction at the output of the hybrid interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid interferometer integrating an optical parametric amplifier and a beam splitter has the potential to outperform the SU(1,1) interferometer. However, photon loss remains a critical limitation for practical implementation. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum metrology scheme utilizing multi-photon subtraction at the output and replacing the conventional 50:50 beam splitter with a variable beam splitter to enhance robustness against photon loss. We employ a coherent state and a vacuum state as inputs and perform homodyne detection. Our results show that the selection of input modes significantly affects phase estimation, and optimizing the beam splitter's transmittance is crucial for maximizing phase sensitivity in lossy conditions. Furthermore, photon subtraction markedly improves phase sensitivity, quantum Fisher information, and robustness against noise. Our scheme achieves sensitivities beyond the Heisenberg limit even under 20% photon loss.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the basis of the non-equilibrium Green function formalism, we derived a spinor Boltzmann equation for the Bose cold atom gases with high spin, which is achieved by a quantum Wigner transformation on the equation satisfied by the lesser Green function. After a Taylor series expansion on the scattering terms, a temperature-dependent spinor damping force can be obtained, which can be related to a non-abelian thermal gauge potential. For the spin-1 Bose gas, the thermal gauge potential constitutes a SU(3) Lie algebra. As an example, we calculate the spin coherence oscillation for the spin-1 Bose cold atom gas trapped in the optical lattice. The relative populations in the Zeeman states as well as the temperature-dependent damping force are illustrated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Local-local Oscillator (LLO) based Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD), the phase reference of the transmitter and receiver, Alice and Bob, are naturally de-correlated due to their use of individual lasers. A phase reference signal is used, whose measurement is critical for estimating the phase difference and correcting the raw QKD data. We observed that asymmetry in the quadrature measurements of the shot noise-limited heterodyne detector affects the accuracy of the reference signal's phase estimation and thereby reduces the achievable transmission distance and key rate of the CV-QKD system. We quantify the effect and propose a method to counteract the effect of detection asymmetry. We also evaluate the effects of detection asymmetry using quantum optical tomography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter coupled Hamiltonians are central to cavity materials engineering and polaritonic chemistry, but are challenging to simulate with classical hardware due to the scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of quantum photon modes and matter complexity. Leveraging the fact that quantum computers naturally represent photonic modes efficiently, we present a novel approach to simulate quantum-electrodynamical (QED) systems on near-term quantum hardware. After developing the bosonic and mixed operators in the Qiskit Nature framework, we employ them to simulate a first-order Trotterized Hamiltonian for a spontaneous-emission problem of a two-level system in an optical cavity. We find that using a standing-waves photonic basis approach leads to fidelity issues due to hardware connectivity constraints and two-qubits gates errors. Hence, we propose using a localized photonic basis approach that enforces nearest-neighbor couplings, thanks to which we can map the Hamiltonian as a 1D qubit chain. We significantly reduce the noise and, by applying the zero-noise extrapolation error mitigation technique, we recover the accurate quantum dynamics. Finally, we also show that this approach is resilient when relaxing the 1D qubit chain approximation.</description>

      <title>Is quantum mechanics merely a theory for us?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an agent-centric account of measurement that treats the preferred-basis problem is fundamentally perspectival. On this view, the system--apparatus--environment decomposition and the observables that are apt to become classically robust are determined by the physical constitution and epistemic constraints of an embodied class of agents. Decoherence then stabilises those agent-specified observables, yielding facts that are stable for us without positing an absolute, observer-independent basis. On this picture, `measurements' are public not because they are metaphysically privileged, but because agents like us share the relevant sensorimotor and operational structure. I motivate this account through a discussion of two recent no-go results for relational quantum mechanics (RQM) (Brukner,2021;Pienaar,2021), and a subsequent response (DiBiagio and Rovelli, 2022): my aim is not to defend RQM per se, but to refine the relational insight with a principled account of basis selection rooted in embodiment. I provide a phenomenological gloss, drawing on body-schema considerations, to argue that quantum mechanics is best understood as an idiosyncratically human description of interactions with the physical world -- a structurally constrained, agent-indexed framework within which classicality emerges.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Neural VMC: An Energy-Variance Convergence Criterion for Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of neural wave functions in variational Monte Carlo(VMC) crucially relies on a robust convergence criterion. While the energy variance is theoretically a definitive measure of an eigenstate, its systematic application as a primary, practical convergence criterion in neural-network VMC has been underexplored. In this work, we propose and validate the energy variance as a universal, quantitative criterion for convergence. Then its reliability is demonstrated across diverse quantum systems-from harmonic oscillators and hydrogen atoms to charmonium hadrons-showing that a variance below 1*10^{-3} guarantees relative errors under 1%. This empirical threshold provides a system-agnostic benchmark for convergence, enabling hands-off operation of the optimization process. We implement this criterion within a lightweight neural solver, thereby enabling automated parameter scans. Its utility is showcased by efficiently mapping ground-state properties of a 2D double-well potential, a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, and a three-body quantum dot. Our work positions the energy-variance criterion as a robust and scalable tool that significantly accelerates the preliminary physical verification of quantum Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics Relative to a Quantum Reference System: Relative State Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an intrinsic or background-independent quantum framework based on entangled state rather than absolute quantum state, it describes a quantum relative state between the under-study quantum system and the quantum measuring apparatus as a quantum reference system, without relying on any external absolute parameter. The paper focuses on a simple example, in which a quantum object's one-dimensional position as an under-study quantum system, and a quantum clock as a quantum reference system or quantum measuring apparatus. The evolution equation of the state of the quantum object's position with respect to the state of the quantum clock is given, which is found to be a complex Gauss-Codazzi type equation of the total quantum state space coming from the Ricci-flat Kahler-Einstein equation. In a linear and non-relativistic approximation, the framework recovers the equation of the standard quantum mechanics, in which an intrinsic potential related to some "inertial force" is automatically incorporated in the covariant derivative. A physical relative probability interpretation and a geometric non-trivial fiber bundle interpretation of the entangled state in this intrinsic quantum framework are given. Furthermore, some non-inertial effects, such as the "inertial force", coming from the general covariance of the intrinsic quantum framework are also discussed. Compared with the functional integral approach which is more easily to generalize the quantum clock to the quantum spacetime reference frame and study quantum gravity, the relative state approach as a canonical description is more suitable for conceptually demonstrating the connections to the standard formalism and interpretation of the quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reciprocity: A Structured-Bath Hamiltonian for Coherent Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic quantum amplifiers maintain coherence even while strongly coupled to their surroundings, demonstrating that coherence can be preserved through architecture rather than isolation. Here we derive a finite structured-bath Hamiltonian in which dissipation and feedback originate from the same microscopic couplings. The resulting self-energy {\Sigma}({\omega}) exhibits coupled real and imaginary parts whose evolution reproduces the breathing dynamics observed in Josephson quantum amplifiers. This establishes quantum reciprocity: macroscopic coherence lives not in isolation, but in structured connection. We numerically validate this principle by engineering a six-qubit structured bath to demonstrate controllable transitions from dissipation to amplification. This architectural core serves as the foundation for a proposed multi-scale workflow to transform quantum noise into a design resource, preserving coherence not through isolation but through architectural reciprocity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Federated Learning: Architectural Elements and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) focuses on collaborative model training without the need to move the private data silos to a central server. Despite its several benefits, the classical FL is plagued with several limitations, such as high computational power required for model training(which is critical for low-resource clients), privacy risks, large update traffic, and non-IID heterogeneity. This chapter surveys a hybrid paradigm - Quantum Federated Learning (QFL), which introduces quantum computation, that addresses multiple challenges of classical FL and offers rapid computing capability while keeping the classical orchestration intact. Firstly, we motivate QFL with a concrete presentation on pain points of classical FL, followed by a discussion on a general architecture of QFL frameworks specifying the roles of client and server, communication primitives and the quantum model placement. We classify the existing QFL systems based on four criteria - quantum architecture (pure QFL, hybrid QFL), data processing method (quantum data encoding, quantum feature mapping, and quantum feature selection &amp; dimensionality reduction), network topology (centralized, hierarchial, decentralized), and quantum security mechanisms (quantum key distribution, quantum homomorphic encryption, quantum differential privacy, blind quantum computing). We then describe applications of QFL in healthcare, vehicular networks, wireless networks, and network security, clearly highlighting where QFL improves communication efficiency, security, and performance compared to classical FL. We close with multiple challenges and future works in QFL, including extension of QFL beyond classification tasks, adversarial attacks, realistic hardware deployment, quantum communication protocols deployment, aggregation of different quantum models, and quantum split learning as an alternative to QFL.</description>

      <title>Field-Trial Quantum Key Distribution with Qubit-Based Frame Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17659v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic technique that uses quantum mechanical principles to enable secure key exchange. Practical deployment of QKD requires robust, cost-effective systems that can operate in challenging field environments. A major challenge is achieving reliable clock synchronization without adding hardware complexity. Conventional approaches often use separate classical light signals, which increase costs and introduce noise that degrades quantum channel performance. To address this limitation, we demonstrate a QKD system incorporating a recently proposed qubit-based distributed frame synchronization method, deployed over a metropolitan fiber network in Nanning, China. Using the polarization-encoded one-decoy-state BB84 protocol and the recently proposed qubit-based distributed frame synchronization method, our system achieves synchronization directly from the quantum signal, eliminating the need for dedicated synchronization hardware. Furthermore, to counteract dynamic polarization disturbances in urban fibers, the system integrates qubit-based polarization feedback control, enabling real-time polarization compensation through an automated polarization controller using data recovered from the qubit-based synchronization signals. During 12 hours of continuous operation, the system maintained a low average quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 1.12/%, achieving a secure key rate of 26.6 kbit/s under 18 dB channel loss. Even under a high channel loss of 40 dB, a finite-key secure rate of 115 bit/s was achieved. This study represents the first successful long-term validation of a frame-synchronization based QKD scheme in a real urban environment, demonstrating exceptional stability and high-loss tolerance, and offering an alternative for building practical, scalable, and cost-efficient quantum-secure communication networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reverse Mapping: Synthesizing an Optimal Spin Qubit Shuttling Bus Architecture for the Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computers scale toward millions of physical qubits, it becomes essential to robustly encode individual logical qubits to ensure fault tolerance under realistic noise. A high-quality foundational encoding allows future compilation techniques and heuristics to build on optimal or near-optimal layouts, improving scalability and error resilience. In this work, we synthesize a one-dimensional shuttling bus architecture for the rotated surface code, leveraging coherent spin-qubit shuttling. We formulate a mixed-integer optimization model that yields optimal solutions with relatively low execution time for small code distances, and propose a scalable heuristic that matches optimal results while maintaining linear computational complexity. We evaluate the synthesized architecture using architectural metrics, such as shuttling distance and cycle time, and full quantum simulations under realistic noise models, showing that the proposed design can sustain logical error rates as low as $2\cdot 10^{-10}$ per round at code distance 21, showcasing its feasibility for scalable quantum error correction in spin-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Topological Dynamical Decoupling with Complete Pulse Error Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic pulse errors remain a major obstacle to high-fidelity quantum control. We present a new family of dynamical decoupling sequences, denoted Tn, that achieve exact cancellation of pulse area errors to all orders by enforcing a simple topological phase condition. Unlike some conventional composite sequences, Tn requires no numerical optimization and admits closed-form analytic phases for arbitrary sequence length, while providing substantial robustness to detuning as well. We demonstrate these sequences on superconducting transmon qubits from both IBM Quantum processor ibm_torino and IQM Quantum processor Garnet, observing population plateaus in close agreement with theory. These results establish a new paradigm for hardware-efficient error suppression, broadly applicable across quantum computing, sensing, and memory platforms.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact Inverse-Designed Silicon-on-Insulator Couplers with Sub-Decibel Coupling Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiber-to-chip couplers play a crucial role in interfacing on-chip photonic circuits with other optical systems or off-chip devices. Downsizing the couplers via topology optimization addresses the demand for high-density integration and improves the scalability of photonic integrated systems. However, these optimized couplers have yet to reach the performance level demonstrated by their conventional counterparts, leaving room for further improvement. In this work, we apply topology optimization to design single-polarization 1D and dual-polarization 2D grating couplers incorporating bottom reflectors and achieve sub-decibel coupling efficiency. Both types of couplers are fabricated on the silicon-on-insulator platform with dimensions of mere 14 $\mu$m $\times$ 14 $\mu$m and are compatible with standard single-mode fibers at normal incidence. From our experimental characterization, the measured peak coupling efficiency of the topology-optimized 1D and 2D couplers is -0.92(1) dB and -0.86(13) dB, respectively, within the telecom C-band. Our demonstration provides a coupling solution for photonic applications requiring high efficiency and high-density integration, such as spatial division multiplexing and photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive empirical comparison between quantum machine learning (QML) and classical machine learning (CML) approaches in Automated Market Makers (AMM) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) trading strategies through extensive backtesting on 10 models across multiple cryptocurrency assets. Our analysis encompasses classical ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression), pure quantum models (VQE Classifier, QNN, QSVM), hybrid quantum-classical models (QASA Hybrid, QASA Sequence, QuantumRWKV), and transformer models. The results demonstrate that hybrid quantum models achieve superior overall performance with 11.2\% average return and 1.42 average Sharpe ratio, while classical ML models show 9.8\% average return and 1.47 average Sharpe ratio. The QASA Sequence hybrid model achieves the highest individual return of 13.99\% with the best Sharpe ratio of 1.76, demonstrating the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches in AMM and DeFi trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for MIMO with Quantized b-bit Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for 6G communication, offering improved spectral efficiency and reliability. However, conventional fully digital designs face significant challenges due to high hardware complexity and power consumption. Low-bit MIMO architectures, such as those employing b-bit quantized phase shifters, provide a cost-effective alternative but introduce NP-hard combinatorial problems in the pre- and post-coding design. This paper explores the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and alternating optimization to address the problem of b-bit quantized phase shifters both at the transmitter and the receiver. We demonstrate that the structure of this quantized beamforming problem aligns naturally with hybrid-classical methods like QAOA, as the phase shifts used in beamforming can be directly mapped to rotation gates in a quantum circuit. Notably, this paper is the first to show that theoretical connection. Then, the Hamiltonian derivation analysis for the b-bit case is presented, which could have applications in different fields, such as integrated sensing and communication, and emerging quantum algorithms such as quantum machine learning. In addition, a warm-start QAOA approach is studied which improves computational efficiency. Numerical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving an improved quantized beamforming gain over their classical optimization benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <title>Social Laser Theory as a Natural Extension of Quantum-Like Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the Social Laser Theory (SLT) as a natural extension of the broader framework of Quantum-Like Modeling (QLM). While QLM applies the mathematical formalism of quantum theory . such as Hilbert space representations, interference, and non-commutative observables - to model context-dependent and non-classical phenomena in cognition, decision-making, and social behavior, SLT advances this approach by integrating concepts from quantum field theory. The theory conceptualizes social systems as ensembles of social atoms capable of absorbing and emitting quantized units of social energy. Under conditions analogous to population inversion in physical lasers, external informational stimuli (e.g., media signals or mobilizing rhetoric) can trigger coherence across the population, resulting in large-scale, synchronized collective actions such as protests or ideological shifts. SLT thus provides a formal framework for understanding the amplification and coherence of social energy leading to abrupt phase-like transitions in collective behavior. Beyond its metaphorical appeal, the theory proposes measurable quantities and predictive parameters that may support empirical diagnostics of sociopolitical dynamics. By bridging micro-level psychological processes with macro-level sociological phenomena, SLT extends QLM into the domain of complex social systems, offering a mathematically grounded paradigm for interpreting rapid transformations in contemporary societies.</description>

      <title>Unravelling inter-channel quantum interference in below-threshold nonsequential double ionization with statistical measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of interchannel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) within the strong-field approximation. Focusing on the below-threshold intensity regime where the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) pathway dominates, we derive analytical phase conditions governing interference between distinct excitation channels for arbitrary driving fields. To quantify the interplay between channels resulting from a vast number of interfering processes, we introduce statistical metrics based on the Earth Mover's Distance, allowing us to assess the relative weight of each channel's contribution to the two-electron photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs). We identify key factors that determine whether interchannel interference is appreciable such as comparable channel intensities, strong spatial overlap between the excited-state wavefunctions and the energy difference between contributing channels. We demonstrate that for linearly polarized few-cycle pulses, the typical intrachannel interference features associated with exchange, temporal shifts and combined exchange-temporal interference are retained with interchannel interference. Our findings establish a hierarchy of interference mechanisms in RESI and may provide practical guidelines for enhancing or suppressing interference in different regions of the momentum plane.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Antimodes in Multi-Drive Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative systems provide a natural setting for the emergence of exceptional points -- i.e. non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenmodes coalesce. These points are important for applications such as sensing, where enhanced sensitivity is required, and exhibit interesting and useful phenomena that can be controlled with experimentally accessible parameters. In this regard a four-port, three-mode, cavity-magnonics platform is demonstrated in which two microwave excitations can be precisely phase shifted and/or attenuated relative to one another. Destructive interference between the hybridised cavity-magnon modes is shown to give rise to antimodes (antiresonances) in the transmission spectrum, enabling coherent perfect extinction of the outgoing signals at selected ports. This interference can be used to actively tune the position and properties of exceptional points, without the fine tuning conventionally required to obtain exceptional points. Such controllable, interference-based engineering of exceptional points provides a practical and flexible pathway toward next-generation, high-sensitivity sensing devices operating at microwave frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these notes the Born series for the $s$-wave scattering $a_0$ is calculated for a class of central potentials $V(r)$ up to sixth order in a dimensionless coupling strength $g$. Examples of exponentially decaying potentials as well truncated potentials involving a single length-scale $a$ are considered. In certain favorable cases the exact result for the $g$-dependent $s$-wave scattering length $a_0=A_0(g) a$ can be given in terms of special functions. The poles of $A_0(g)$ at increasing positive values of $g$ correspond to the thresholds, where $s$-wave bound-states occur successively.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the distribution of single-photon-level pulses from a mode-locked laser source over a phase-stable fiber link, achieving an optical timing jitter of less than 100 as over 10 minutes of data accumulation. This stability enables a fidelity greater than 0.998 between two stabilized 2.1 km long deployed fiber links. Building on time and frequency metrology techniques traditionally used for high-stability optical atomic clock signal distribution, we use time and frequency multiplexing to achieve an isolation of quantum and classical channels by better than $10^{10}$. Our results mark a necessary step towards scalable, high-rate quantum networks with a provable quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fermionic and bosonic systems coupled to a real or synthetic static gauge field that is quantized, so the field itself is a quantum degree of freedom and can exist in coherent superposition. A natural example is electrons on a quantum ring encircling a quantized magnetic flux (QMF) generated by a superconducting current. We show that coupling to a common QMF gives rise to an emergent interaction between particles with no classical analog, as it is topological and nonlocal (independent of interparticle distance). Moreover, the interaction persists even when the particles lie in a nominally field-free region, with the vector potential mediating the interaction. We analyze several one- and two-dimensional model systems, encompassing both real and synthetic gauge fields. These systems exhibit unusual behavior, including strong nonlinearities, non-integer Chern numbers, and quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, synthetic gauge fields offer high tunability and can reach field strengths that are difficult to realize with real magnetic fields, enabling engineered nonlinearities and interaction profiles.</description>

      <title>Infrared Absorption and Laser Spectroscopy of Ho$^{3+}$ Doped K$_2$YF$_5$ Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy are used to determine electronic energy levels for Ho$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A total of 72 crystal-field energy levels, distributed among 8 multiplets, are assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling of the electronic structure of Ho$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Partially-resolved hyperfine splittings are accurately reproduced by the model. The temperature dependence of the fluorescent lifetime of the $^5$F$_5$ multiplet is measured and the temperature dependence of the non-radiative relaxation is modelled by a five-phonon process. Preliminary measurements of infra-red to visible upconversion in microparticles co-doped with Ho$^{3+}$ and Yb$^{3+}$ is reported.</description>

      <title>Marginal Influence of Anomalous Josephson Current on Odd-Frequency Spin-Triplet Pairing in Ferromagnetic Josephson Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine how an anomalous Josephson current influences odd-frequency superconducting correlations in two distinct Josephson junction geometries. The first configuration consists of two ferromagnetic layers sandwiched between conventional s-wave superconductors, with the magnetization vectors of the ferromagnets misaligned. The second involves three ferromagnetic layers embedded between two s-wave superconductors, with their magnetizations oriented along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. In the first case, where the anomalous Josephson current is absent, odd-frequency spin-triplet correlations develop pronounced peaks at finite magnetization strengths in both the tunneling and transparent limits, while the equal-spin triplet component exhibits zeros at finite magnetizations in the transparent regime. In the second configuration, where an anomalous Josephson current is present, similar peaks in odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing appear at finite magnetizations under both transport regimes, and the spatial profile of these correlations remains largely unaffected by the current\rq{}s presence. The Josephson diode efficiency is finite and attains its maximum at magnetization values corresponding to the peaks of the anomalous current. Overall, our results demonstrate that the anomalous Josephson current has only a marginal effect on odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, suggesting that the emergence of odd-frequency correlations and the Josephson diode effect are largely independent phenomena, contrary to some earlier conjectures.</description>

      <title>Strong-field Driven Sub-cycle Band Structure Modulation Measured with Ultrafast Electric Field Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, ultrafast electron dynamics in the solid state have been extensively studied using various strong light-matter interaction techniques, such as high-harmonic generation. These studies lead to multiple interpretations of light-matter interaction in the strong-field regime, with exact mechanisms not yet fully understood. It is known that strong-field interaction with a crystalline solid leads to significant modification of its band structure and hence its optical properties on ultrafast timescales. In this work, we present measurements with ultrafast electric field observables in magnesium oxide from a non-resonant nonlinear optical interaction. Using field observables, we show that the ultrafast, strong-field light-matter interaction modulates the band structure on sub-cycle time scales, resulting in a modulation of the nonlinear optical response of the material. We perform time-dependent perturbation theory calculations with a field-dependent dispersion relation and non-perturbative semiconductor Bloch equation calculations, which agree with experimental observations. Our work offers a new perspective on strong-field-driven electron dynamics in solids through the lens of electric field observables. The demonstrated attosecond modulation of the nonlinear response could have important implications for quantum light generation using nonlinear optical processes.</description>

      <title>Correlation of divergency: c-delta. Being different in a similar way or not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the correlation-of-divergency coefficient, c-delta, a custom statistical measure designed to quantify the similarity of internal divergence patterns between two groups of values. Unlike conventional correlation coefficients such as Pearson or Spearman, which assess the association between paired values, c-delta evaluates whether the way values differ within one group is mirrored in another. The method involves calculating, for each value, its divergence from all other values in its group, and then comparing these patterns across the two groups (e.g., human vs machine intelligence). The coefficient is normalised by the average root mean square divergence within each group, ensuring scale invariance. Potential applications of c-delta span quantum physics, where it can compare the spread of measurement outcomes between quantum systems, as well as fields such as genetics, ecology, psychometrics, manufacturing, machine learning, and social network analysis. The measure is particularly useful for benchmarking, clustering validation, and assessing the similarity of variability structures. While c-delta is not bounded between -1 and 1 and may be sensitive to outliers (but so is PMCC), it offers a new perspective for analysing internal variability and divergence. The article discusses the mathematical formulation, potential adaptations for complex data, and the interpretative considerations relevant to this alternative approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Charge and Spin Transport in $\beta12$ Borophene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical research has been conducted to study how geometry affects charge and spin transport in $\beta\mathrm{12}$ borophene quantum dots, which are confined systems. The study examined two distinct central regions, which included a circular disc and a regular hexagonal area that connected to semi-infinite zigzag and armchair borophene nanoribbon leads. The system was described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration: armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts. Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and $\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Erasure-prone Quantum Storage with Erasure-prone Entanglement Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum message is encoded into $N$ storage nodes (quantum systems $Q_1\dots Q_N$) with assistance from $N_B$ maximally entangled bi-partite quantum systems $A_1B_1, \dots, A_{N_B}B_{N_B}$, that are prepared in advance such that $B_1\dots B_{N_B}$ are stored separately as entanglement assistance (EA) nodes, while $A_1\dots A_{N_B}$ are made available to the encoder. Both the storage nodes and EA nodes are erasure-prone. The quantum message must be recoverable given any $K$ of the $N$ storage nodes along with any $K_B$ of the $N_B$ EA nodes. The capacity for this setting is the maximum size of the quantum message, given that the size of each EA node is $\lambda_B$. All node sizes are relative to the size of a storage node, which is normalized to unity. The exact capacity is characterized as a function of $N,K,N_B,K_B, \lambda_B$ in all cases, with one exception. The capacity remains open for an intermediate range of $\lambda_B$ values when a strict majority of the $N$ storage nodes, and a strict non-zero minority of the $N_B$ EA nodes, are erased. As a key stepping stone, an analogous classical storage (with shared-randomness assistance) problem is introduced. A set of constraints is identified for the classical problem, such that classical linear code constructions translate to quantum storage codes, and the converse bounds for the two settings utilize similar insights. In particular, the capacity characterizations for the classical and quantum settings are shown to be identical in all cases where the capacity is settled.</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Rate of Lie-Trotter Approximation for Quantum Thermal Averages</title>

Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>QPMeL - Quantum-Aware Classically-Trained Embeddings via Projective Metric Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01655v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was also adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL consists of a 2-step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit into the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum Circuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with $R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of $ZZ(\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of gates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.</description>

Abstract: With the surge of quantum computing platforms that continue to push the boundaries of capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, there is a growing interest in finding relevant applications and quantifying the corresponding error budgets. We present a simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of small organic molecules on publicly available cloud quantum computers. We are using two quantum computing platforms, namely IBM's quantum processors based on superconducting qubits and IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer addressed via Amazon Braket. We analyze the impact of noise on the obtained NMR spectra, and we formulate an effective decoherence rate that quantifies the threshold noise that our proposed algorithm can tolerate. We show that the effective decoherence rate can be calculated using simple fidelity metrics that are available by cloud quantum computing providers. Our investigation paves the way to better employ such application-driven quantum tasks on current noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a family of approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquid problems. These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly outperform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code and PXP Rydberg Hamiltonian models, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of general noise-model parameters from the syndrome statistics of surface codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of error correction in the surface code can be enhanced by leveraging the knowledge of the noise model for physical qubits. To provide accurate noise information to the decoder in parallel with quantum computation, an adaptive estimation of the noise model based on syndrome measurement statistics is an effective approach. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-established for Pauli noise, it remains unexplored for more complex and realistic scenarios such as amplitude damping which cannot be represented as a Pauli channel. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference methods for general noise models, integrating a tensor network simulator of surface code, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic scenario, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present numerical results of applying our proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and nonuniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.</description>

      <title>Complementarity-based complementarity: the choice of mutually unbiased observables shapes quantum uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11395v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum uncertainty relations impose fundamental limits on the joint knowledge that can be acquired from complementary observables: perfect knowledge of a quantum state in one basis implies maximal indetermination in all other mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Uncertainty relations derived from joint properties of the MUBs are generally assumed to be uniform, irrespective of the specific observables chosen within a set. In this work, we demonstrate instead that the uncertainty relations can depend on the choice of observables. Through both experimental observation and numerical methods, we show that selecting different sets of three MUBs in a 5-dimensional quantum system results in distinct uncertainty bounds, i.e. in varying degrees of complementarity, in terms of both entropy and variance.</description>

      <title>Semi-definite optimization of the measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum--classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos, Randomness and Universal Scaling of Entanglement in Various Krylov Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for advancing quantum technologies, with considerable research efforts directed toward achieving its rapid and scalable generation. In this work, we derive an analytical expression for the time-averaged quantum Fisher information (QFI), enabling the detection of scalable multipartite entanglement dynamically generated by all quantum chaotic systems governed by Dyson's ensembles. Our approach integrates concepts of randomness and quantum chaos, demonstrating that the QFI is universally determined by the structure and dimension of the Krylov space that confines the chaotic dynamics. In particular, the QFI ranges from $N^2/3$ for $N$ qubits in the permutation-symmetric subspace (e.g. for chaotic kicked top models with long-range interactions), to $N$ when the dynamics extend over the full Hilbert space with or without bit reversal symmetry or parity symmetry (e.g. in chaotic models with short-range Ising-like interactions). In the former case, the QFI reveals multipartite entanglement among $N/3$ qubits and highlights the power of chaotic collective spin systems in generating scalable multipartite entanglement. Interestingly this result can be related to isotropic substructures in the Wigner distribution of chaotic states and demonstrates the efficacy of quantum chaos for Heisenberg-scaling quantum metrology. Finally, our general expression for the QFI agrees with that obtained for random states and, differently from out-of-time-order-correlators, it can also distinguish chaotic from integrable unstable spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-based continuous attacks on quantum key distribution protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most important characteristic of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol is its security against third-party attacks, and the potential countermeasures available. While new types of attacks are regularly developed in the literature, they rarely involve the use of weak continuous measurement and more specifically machine learning to infer the qubit states. In this paper, we design a new individual attack scheme called \textit{Deep-learning-based continuous attack} (DLCA) that exploits continuous measurement together with the powerful pattern recognition capacities of deep recurrent neural networks. As a minimal model, we present its performances when applied in the case of the BB84 protocol with intrinsic noise in the communication channel. Our results suggest that our attack's performances lie between the ones of standard intercept-and-resend attacks and of the optimal individual attack, namely the phase-covariant quantum cloner. Our attack scheme demonstrates deep-learning-enhanced quantum state tomography applied to QKD, and could be generalized in many different ways, notably in the cases of quantum hacking attacks targeting implementation vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of QKD protocols.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal interaction and quantum friction in sliding Bi$_2$Se$_3$ topological surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films exhibit unique electronic properties arising from their topologically protected surface states. In a theoretical model capturing the essential physics of Dirac electrons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. By using experimental Fermi velocities of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, our results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</description>

Abstract: Error filtration is a hardware scheme that mitigates noise by exploiting auxiliary qubits and entangling gates. Although both signal and ancillas are subject to local noise, constructive interference(and in some cases post-selection) allows us to reduce the noise level in the signal qubit. Here we determine the optimal entangling unitary gates that make the qubits interfere most effectively,starting from a set of universal gates and proceeding by optimizing suitable functionals by gradient-descent or stochastic approximation. We examine how our optimized scheme behaves under imperfect implementation, where ancillary qubits may be noisy or subject to cross-talk. Even with these imperfections, we find that adding more ancillary qubits helps in protecting quantum information . We benchmark our approach against figures of merit that correspond to different applications, including entanglement fidelity, quantum Fisher information (for applications in quantum sensing),and CHSH value (for cryptographic applications), with one, two, and three ancillary qubits. With one and two ancillas we also provide analytical explicit expressions from an ansatz for the optimal unitary. We also compare our method with the recently introduced Superposed Quantum Error Mitigation (SQEM) scheme based on superposition of causal orders, and show that, for a wide range of noise strengths, our approach may outperform SQEM in terms of effectiveness and robustness.</description>

Abstract: Quantum control plays a crucial role in enhancing precision scaling for quantum sensing. However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with time domain imperfections, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.</description>

      <title>Global Coherence in Quantum Discord as a Resource</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04430v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses which aspect of \textit{bipartite coherence} in \textit{quantum discord} is essential for \textit{genuinely quantum correlation}. To this end, \textit{global coherence} of bipartite states is defined as a form of bipartite coherence that is not local coherence in either of the subsystems or in both subsystems alone, and we identify it as being indicated by a witness of discord. With \textit{global coherence} as \textit{a resource}, \textit{any local operations} of the form $\Phi_A \otimes \Phi_B$, which may create coherence locally, are \textit{free operations}. This implies that with global coherence as a resource for operational tasks, any local operations can be freely used, but require \textit{classical randomness not to be freely} available. Using this identification, we demonstrate that \textit{global coherence} is a \textit{necessary resource} for the task of \textit{semi-device-independent steerability} of quantum discord. On the other hand, for the task of \textit{remote state preparation} using \textit{quantum discord} in two-qubit states, a \textit{necessary and sufficient quantum resource} is identified by invoking a \textit{witness of global coherence}.</description>

Abstract: Advances in sensing devices that utilize nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles in diamond are driving progress in microscale nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Utilizing quantum sensing techniques in the high-field regime significantly boosts sensitivity by increasing thermal polarization and improves spectral quality via enhanced energy shifts. Compatible with the latter, a straightforward manner to further raise sensor sensitivity is to increase NV concentration, although this intensifies detrimental dipole-dipole interactions among NVs. In this Letter, we present a method for detecting NMR signals in high-field scenarios while effectively suppressing dipole-dipole couplings in the NV ensemble. Thus, this approach enhances sensitivity by combining highly doped diamond substrates and elevated magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states that remain separable (i.e., not entangled) under any global unitary transformation are known as absolutely separable and form a convex set. Despite extensive efforts, the complete characterization of this set remains largely unknown. In this work, we employ linear maps and their inverses to derive new sufficient analytical conditions for absolute separability in arbitrary dimensions, providing extremal points of this set and improving its characterization. Additionally, we employ convex geometry optimization to refine the characterization of the set when multiple non-comparable criteria for absolute separability are available. We also address the closely related problem of characterizing the absolute PPT (positive partial transposition) set, which consists of quantum states that remain positive under partial transposition across all unitary transformations. Finally, we extend our results to multipartite states.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronizing clocks to measure time is a fundamental process underpinning every practical communication task from GPS to parallel computation. However, as the current protocols are based on classical communication between the sender and receiver, they are prone to simple attacks that could cause a slight delay in the signal which would then cause a massive error in further operations. In this work, we first explain a simple attack that in principle can cause an arbitrary delay in the signal between sender and receiver. We then propose a way to overcome this problem by using a recently contrived idea of device-independent certification which utilises quantum nonlocality. Consequently, clocks can be synchronized in a highly secure way without trusting any devices in the setup. We then extend this proposal to observe relativistic time dilation in a device-independent manner.</description>

Abstract: We consider estimation of unknown unitary operation when the set of possible unitary operations is given by a projective unitary representation of a compact group. We show that neither indefinite causal order strategy nor adaptive strategy improves the performance of this estimation when error function satisfies group covariance. That is, the optimal parallel strategy gives the optimal performance even under indefinite causal order strategy and adaptive strategy. To study this problem, we newly introduce the concept of generalized positive operator valued measure (GPOVM), and its convariance condition. Using these concepts, we show the above statement.</description>

Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the probability distribution function (PDF) and full counting statistics (FCS) play a fundamental role in characterizing the fluctuations of quantum observables, as they encode the complete information about these fluctuations. In this letter, we measure these two quantities in a trapped-ion quantum simulator for the transverse and longitudinal magnetization within a subsystem. We utilize the toolbox of classical shadows to postprocess the measurements performed in random bases. The measurement scheme efficiently allows access to the FCS and PDF of all possible operators on desired choices of subsystems of an extended quantum system.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the dynamical state of many-body bosonic and fermionic many-body models with inter-site Gaussian couplings, on-site non-Gaussian interactions and local dissipation comprising incoherent particle loss, particle gain, and dephasing. We first establish that, for fermionic systems, if the dephasing noise is larger than the non-Gaussian interactions, irrespective of the Gaussian coupling strength, the system state is a convex combination of Gaussian states at all times. Furthermore, for bosonic systems, we show that if the particle loss and particle gain rates are larger than the Gaussian inter-site couplings, the system remains in a separable state at all times. Building on this characterization, we establish that at noise rates above a threshold, there exists a classical algorithm that can efficiently sample from the system state of both the fermionic and bosonic models. Finally, we show that, unlike fermionic systems, bosonic systems can evolve into states that are not convex-Gaussian even when the dissipation is much higher than the on-site non-Gaussianity. Similarly, unlike bosonic systems, fermionic systems can generate entanglement even with noise rates much larger than the inter-site couplings.</description>

      <title>Exact non-Markovian master equations: a generalized derivation for Gaussian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact master equation that captures the dynamics of a quadratic quantum system linearly coupled to a Gaussian environment of the same statistics: the Gaussian Master Equation (GME). Unlike previous approaches, our formulation applies universally to both bosonic and fermionic setups, and remains valid even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, allowing for the exact computation of the system's reduced density matrix across all parameter regimes. Remarkably, the GME shares the same operatorial structure as the Redfield equation and depends on a single kernel - a dressed environment correlation function accounting for all virtual interactions between the system and the environment. This simple structure grants a clear physical interpretation and makes the GME easy to simulate numerically, as we show by applying it to an open system based on two fermions coupled via superconductive pairing.</description>

      <title>Long-range bipartite entanglement in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range bipartite entanglement (LBE) and its distribution properties are studied in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions (ELRIs and PLRIs). LBE quantified by two-qubit concurrence decays exponentially along with two-site distance in the infinite chain with ELRIs in the thermodynamic limit, and the long-range behavior of two-spin entanglement can detect the quantum phase transition and identify different quantum phases away from the critical point. Moreover, a fine-grained LBE distribution relation is obtained for the infinite XXZ spin chain. On the other hand, in the finite XXZ spin chain with the conventional PLRIs, the long-range concurrence decays algebraically and the total one is no longer monotonic along with the chain length. The total LBE distribution property can exhibit a piecewise function, which has a close relationship with the decaying mode and strength of PLRIs. These LBE relations can be regarded as the generalization of Koashi-Bu\v{z}ek-Imoto bound for the prototypical long-range XXZ model, having potential applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Chiral cat code: Enhanced error correction induced by higher-order nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Schr\"odinger chiral cat qubit, a novel bosonic quantum code generalizing Kerr cat qubits that exploits higher-order nonlinearities. Compared to a standard Kerr cat, the chiral cat qubit allows additional correction of bit-flip errors within the Hilbert space of a single bosonic oscillator. Indeed, this code displays optical bistability, i.e., the simultaneous presence of multiple long-lived states. Two of them define the code space and two define an error space. Thanks to the chiral structure of the phase space of this system, the error space can be engineered to ``capture'' bit flip events in the code space (a bit-flip trap), without affecting the quantum information stored in the system. Therefore, it is possible to perform detection and correction of errors. We demonstrate how this topological effect can be particularly efficient in the presence of large dephasing. We provide concrete examples of the performance of the code and show the possibility of applying quantum operations rapidly and efficiently. Beyond the interest in this single technological application, our work demonstrates how the topology of phase space can enhance the performance of bosonic codes.</description>

      <title>Harnessing electron motion for global spin qubit control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are promising candidates for building scalable quantum computers due to their nanometre scale features. However, delivering microwave control signals locally to each qubit poses a challenge and instead methods that utilise global control fields have been proposed. These require tuning the frequency of selected qubits into resonance with a global field while detuning the rest to avoid crosstalk. Common frequency tuning methods, such as electric-field-induced Stark shift, are insufficient to cover the frequency variability across large arrays of qubits. Here, we argue that electron motion, and especially the recently demonstrated high-fidelity shuttling, can be leveraged to enhance frequency tunability. Our conclusions are supported by numerical simulations proving its efficiency on concrete architectures such as a 2$\times$N array of qubits and the recently introduced looped pipeline architecture. Specifically, we show that the use of our schemes enables single-qubit fidelity improvements up to a factor of 100 compared to the state-of-the-art. Finally, we show that our scheme can naturally be extended to perform two-qubit gates globally.</description>

      <title>Symmetric channel verification for purifying noisy quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry inherent in quantum states has been widely used to reduce the effect of noise in quantum error correction and a quantum error mitigation technique known as symmetry verification. However, these symmetry-based techniques exploit symmetry in quantum states rather than quantum channels, limiting their application to cases where the entire circuit shares the same symmetry. In this work, we propose symmetric channel verification (SCV), a channel purification protocol that leverages the symmetry inherent in quantum channels. By introducing different phases to each symmetric subspace and employing a quantum phase estimation-like circuit, SCV can detect and correct symmetry-breaking noise in quantum channels. We further propose a hardware-efficient implementation of SCV at the virtual level, which requires only a single-qubit ancilla and is robust against the noise in the ancilla qubit. Our protocol is applied to various Hamiltonian simulation circuits and phase estimation circuits, resulting in a significant reduction of errors. Furthermore, in setups where only Clifford unitaries can be used for noise purification, which is relevant in the early fault-tolerant regime, we show that SCV under Pauli symmetry represents the optimal purification method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for generating single- and multimode qubit-conditional operations by extending cross-resonant driving to a generalized multimode scheme. This includes single-mode conditional displacements and squeezing induced by one- and two-photon cross-resonant drives in the presence of one- and two-photon qubit-oscillator interactions, respectively. In the multimode setting, we derive multimode qubit-conditional joint displacement, beamsplitter and two-mode squeezing operations. This framework enables the realization of arbitrary multimode qubit-conditional operations, which are of great importance to bosonic quantum error correction, phase estimation and quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum batteries can be charged by performing a work ``instantaneously'' in the limit of large number of cells. In general, the work exhibits statistics that can be represented by a quasiprobability in the presence of initial quantum coherence in the energy basis. Here we show that these two concepts of quantum thermodynamics, which apparently appear disconnected, show a simple relation. Specifically, if the work distribution shows negativity in some time interval, then we can surely get quantum advantage in the charging process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for harnessing the potential of near-term quantum devices to address complex challenges across quantum science and technology. Yet, the robust and scalable quantification of entanglement in many-body quantum systems remains a significant challenge, crucial for both advancing theoretical understanding and enabling practical applications. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm to evaluate the $M$-partite geometric entanglement across arbitrary partitions of an $N$-qubit system into $M$ parties. By constructing tailored variational ansatz circuits for both single- and multi-qubit parties, we optimize the overlap between a target quantum state and an $M$-partite variational separable state. This method provides a flexible and scalable approach for characterizing arbitrary $M$-partite entanglement in complex quantum systems of a given dimension. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed by reproducing known analytical results. We further demonstrate its capability to evaluate entanglement among $M$ parties for any given conventional or unconventional partitions of one- and two-dimensional spin systems, both near and at a quantum critical point. Our results establish the versatility of the variational approach in capturing different types of entanglement in various quantum systems, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. Our approach offers a powerful methodology for advancing research in quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and quantum field theory. Additionally, we discuss its advantages, highlighting its adaptability to diverse system architectures in the context of near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we introduce, develop, and investigate a connection between multiphoton quantum interference, a core element of emerging photonic quantum technologies, and Hopfieldlike Hamiltonians of classical neural networks, the paradigmatic models for associative memory and machine learning in systems of artificial intelligence. Specifically, we show that combining a system composed of Nph indistinguishable photons in superposition over M field modes, a controlled array of M binary phase-shifters, and a linear-optical interferometer, yields output photon statistics described by means of a p-body Hopfield Hamiltonian of M Ising-like neurons +-1, with p = 2Nph. We investigate in detail the generalized 4-body Hopfield model obtained through this procedure and show that it realizes a transition from a memory retrieval to a memory black-out regime, i.e. a spin-glass phase, as the amount of stored memory increases. The mapping enables novel routes to the realization and investigation of disordered and complex classical systems via efficient photonic quantum simulators, as well as the description of aspects of structured photonic systems in terms of classical spin Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we observe a novel resonant mechanism, namely the modulation-induced Feshbach resonance. By applying a far-detuned laser to the cesium D2 transition with intensity modulation, we periodically shake the energy levels of atomic collisional states. This periodic shaking connects the free-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we observe significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling between these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of Feshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field domain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of molecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these bound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum, which are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based on molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a magnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic interactions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new Feshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic resonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new opportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing sensors with large particle numbers $N$ that can resolve subtle physical effects is a central goal in precision measurement science. Entangled quantum sensors can surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), where the signal variance scales as $1/N$, and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL) with variance scaling as $1/N^2$. However, entangled states are typically more sensitive to noise, especially common-mode noise such as magnetic field fluctuations, control phase noise, or vibrations in atomic interferometers. We propose a two-node entanglement-enhanced quantum sensor network for differential signal estimation that intrinsically rejects common-mode noise while remaining robust against local, uncorrelated noise. This architecture enables sensitivities approaching the Heisenberg limit. We investigate two state preparation strategies: (i) unitary entanglement generation analogous to bosonic two-mode squeezing, yielding Heisenberg scaling; and (ii) dissipative preparation via collective emission into a shared cavity mode, offering a $\sqrt{N}$ improvement over the SQL. Numerical simulations confirm that both protocols remain effective under realistic conditions, supporting scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in the presence of dominant common-mode noise.</description>

      <title>Fidelity of entanglement and quantum entropies: unveiling their relationship in quantum states and channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as a fundamental resource for various quantum information processing tasks. Fidelity of entanglement (which measures the proximity to a maximally entangled state) and various quantum entropies are key indicators for certifying entanglement in a quantum state. Quantum states with high fidelity are particularly useful for numerous information-theoretic applications. Similarly, states possessing negative conditional entropy provide significant advantages in several quantum information processing protocols. In this work, we examine the relationship between these two indicators of entanglement, both in state and channel regimes. First, we present a comprehensive analysis and characterization of channels that reduce fidelity of entanglement beyond a threshold limit of bipartite composite systems. In this context, we introduce the notion of fidelity annihilating channel and discuss its topological characterization, along with various information-theoretic properties. We then provide a comparison between channels that diminish the fidelity of entanglement and negative conditional entropies, using the depolarizing channel as an illustrative example. In particular, we determine the parameter regimes in which the depolarizing channel belongs to a given family and establish connections among these families of channels. Extending our analysis from channels to the state level, we further examine the relationship between the fidelity of entanglement and various quantum entropies for general two-qubit states. We derive the upper bound on R\'enyi 2-entropy, conditional R\'enyi 2-entropy, Tsallis 2-entropy, and conditional Tsallis 2-entropy, in terms of the fidelity of entanglement. Finally, we explore the relationship between relative entropy and the fidelity of entanglement of a two qudit quantum state.</description>

      <title>A Random Matrix Theory of Pauli Tomography</title>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST), the process of reconstructing some unknown quantum state $\hat\rho$ from repeated measurements on copies of said state, is a foundationally important task in the context of quantum computation and simulation. For this reason, a detailed characterization of the error $\Delta\hat\rho = \hat\rho-\hat\rho^\prime$ in a QST reconstruction $\hat\rho^\prime$ is of clear importance to quantum theory and experiment. In this work, we develop a fully random matrix theory (RMT) treatment of state tomography in informationally-complete bases; and in doing so we reveal deep connections between QST errors $\Delta\hat\rho$ and the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). By exploiting this connection we prove that wide classes of functions of the spectrum of $\Delta\hat\rho$ can be evaluated by substituting samples of an appropriate GUE for realizations of $\Delta\hat\rho$. This powerful and flexible result enables simple analytic treatments of the mean value and variance of the error as quantified by the trace distance $\|\Delta\hat\rho\|_\mathrm{Tr}$ (which we validate numerically for common tomographic protocols), allows us to derive a bound on the QST sample complexity, and subsequently demonstrate that said bound doesn't change under the most widely-used rephysicalization procedure. These results collectively demonstrate the flexibility, strength, and broad applicability of our approach; and lays the foundation for broader studies of RMT treatments of QST in the future.</description>

      <title>Detectability of post-Newtonian classical and quantum gravity via quantum clock interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity-induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Furthermore, our scheme allows for testing whether the observed gravity-induced entanglement is consistent with the quantum equivalence principle. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Memory effects in a dynamical decoupling process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a simple quantitative relationship between the environmental memory effects and the characteristics in a dynamical decoupling process. In contrast to previous works, our measures of non-Markovianity are tailored and extended to evaluate the strength of memory effects in dynamical decoupling. We find that if each kick commutes with the dynamical map of the uncontrolled system, then the change of the final dynamical map or the final state brought by the control (called the "effect of control") is upper (lower) bounded by the summation (difference) of the strengths of memory effects with and without control. We propose sufficient conditions for the commutation relation for parity kicks and illustrate our finding with a dissipative quantum Rabi model by numerical simulations where one or many cycles of parity kicks are implemented on the qubit. Besides, the results show that under certain conditions, the effect of control or the increase of performance by the control may be simply proportional to the strength of memory effects with or without control.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely, the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum reinforcement learning in real-world finance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing in the Computational Landscape of Power Electronics: Vision and Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as a promising technology for solving complex optimization problems that arise in various engineering fields. Therefore, it holds significant promise to transform the computational foundations of power electronics. Motivated by this potential, this paper adopts a visionary perspective to examine how quantum computing could influence the evolution of power electronics in areas such as converter design, control, modulation, simulation workflows, and beyond. Within this framework, the current status, limitations, and anticipated progress of quantum algorithms and hardware are discussed, together with their potential to enable efficient solutions to large-scale, multiobjective, mixed-integer optimization problems. To place these developments in context, the paper begins with a concise tutorial on fundamental concepts in quantum computing, serving as both an introduction to the field and a bridge to its potential applications in power electronics. As a first step in this direction, the use of quantum computing for solving offline mixed-integer optimization problems commonly encountered in power electronics is examined. To this end, a simplified power electronics design problem is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and executed on quantum hardware, despite current limitations such as low qubit counts and hardware noise. This demonstration marks a pioneering step towards leveraging quantum computing in power electronics and motivates the value of early adoption and exploration. Building on these insights, the paper outlines a forward-looking vision in which quantum computing becomes an integral part of the computational landscape of power electronics, guiding its transition from classical to quantum-enabled design and operation.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enhanced Entanglement Detection Under Noisy Quantum Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurements are inherently noisy, hindering reliable entanglement detection and limiting the scalability of quantum technologies. While error mitigation and correction strategies exist, they often impose prohibitive resource overheads. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to achieve noise-resilient entanglement classification even with imperfect measurements. Using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on features extracted from Pauli measurements, we develop a robust optimal entanglement witness (ROEW) that remains effective under unknown measurement noise. By optimizing SVM parameters against worst-case errors, our protocol significantly outperforms conventional methods in classification accuracy.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that ROEW achieves high-fidelity entanglement detection with minimal measurements, even when measurement errors exceed 10\%. This work bridges machine learning and quantum information science, offering a practical tool for noise-robust quantum characterization and advancing the feasibility of entanglement-based technologies in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Bounding quantum uncommon information with quantum neural estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit unique properties and hold significant promise for diverse applications, yet their dynamical simulation poses a particular challenge due to intrinsic openness and non-unitary evolution. Here, we introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for simulating the dynamics of arbitrary time-dependent non-Hermitian systems. Notably, this approach constitutes a natural extension of the quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) algorithm. This algorithm combines the advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.</description>

Abstract: Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional scattering theory is recovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for multiphoton ionization driven by arbitrary quantum states of light. Our simulations predict that cross sections can be enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude with momentum-entangled photons produced by modern nanoscale quantum light sources. The enhancement is tied to the broad angular spectrum of such sources, and is severely underestimated by conventional approaches using the paraxial approximation. Reasonable estimates of the resonant two-photon ionization cross section in sodium atoms indicate that these effects should be observable with current technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum form of the Poincar\'e recurrence theorem stipulates that a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and discrete energy levels returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a finite time. Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of Poincar\'e revivals. Our study of quantum recurrence provides new insight into how thermalization emerges in isolated quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stationary potential scattering admits a formulation in terms of the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. We use this formulation to give a proof of the reciprocity theorem in two and three dimensions that does not rely on the properties of the scattering operator, Green's functions, or Green's identities. In particular, we identify reciprocity with an operator identity satisfied by an integral operator $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$, called the fundamental transfer matrix. This is a multi-dimensional generalization of the transfer matrix $\mathbf{M}$ of potential scattering in one dimension that stores the information about the scattering amplitude of the potential. We use the property of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ that is responsible for reciprocity to identify the analog of the relation, $\det{\mathbf{M}}=1$, in two and three dimensions, and establish a generic anti-pseudo-Hermiticity of the scattering operator. Our results apply for both real and complex potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect in parity-time symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has been demonstrated in both closed and open Hermitian quantum systems. While some studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points--non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level--in open Hermitian quantum systems, it remains largely unexplored whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we demonstrate unequivocally the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Using established quantifiers for QMPE, we show numerically that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Interestingly, neither Hamiltonian nor Liouvillian exceptional points demarcate the boundaries of the QMPE regime. To complement numerical results, we develop an analytical description based on a long-time approximation of the relaxation dynamics of quantifiers. This approach allows us to decipher the number of intersections between two dynamical trajectories of quantifier starting from two initial conditions in the validity regime of the long-time approximation, thereby providing additional information that delineate the parameter regimes supporting the genuine QMPE. We further demonstrate the robustness of QMPE against increasing the number of qubits and dephasing effect. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also suggest its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information quantities, such as mutual information and entropies, are essential for characterizing quantum systems and protocols in quantum information science. In this contribution, we identify types of information measures based on generalized divergences and prove their invariance under local isometric or unitary transformations. Leveraging the reversal channel for local isometries together with the data processing inequality, we establish invariance for information quantities used in both asymptotic and one-shot regimes without relying on the specific functional form of the underlying divergence. These invariances can be applied to improve the computation of such information quantities or optimize protocols and their output states whose performance is determined by some invariant measure. Our results improve the capability to characterize and compute many operationally relevant information measures with application across the field of quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Complementarity constitutes a central aspect of quantum theory. It manifests itself, for example, in a two-way interferometer, where the simultaneous observation of an interference pattern and the acquisition of which-way information are limited by an inequality known as the duality relation. Here, we investigate which-way information in a double-slit interferometer and show that it can be correlated to the phase of the quantum object at the detection screen, leading to a phase-dependent which-way knowledge. In specific cases, this knowledge can locally exceed the limit set by the duality relation. Based on this observation, we propose a feed-forward protocol that aims at maximizing the which-way information locally for each phase after the particle has been recorded on the screen. This allows us to surpass the duality relation limit even globally. We present analytical results as a proof of principle of our protocol as well as numerical outcomes quantifying the amount of maximally achievable which-way knowledge.</description>

      <title>Subspace Variational Quantum Simulation: Fidelity Lower Bounds as Measures of Training Success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an iterative variational quantum algorithm to simulate the time evolution of arbitrary initial states within a given subspace. The algorithm compresses the Trotter circuit into a shorter-depth parameterized circuit, which is optimized simultaneously over multiple initial states in a single training process using fidelity-based cost functions. After the whole training procedure, we provide an efficiently computable lower bound on the fidelities for arbitrary states within the subspace, which guarantees the performance of the algorithm in the worst-case training scenario. We also show our cost function exhibits a barren-plateau-free region near the initial parameters at each iteration in the training landscape. The experimental demonstration of the algorithm is presented through the simulation of a 2-qubit Ising model on an IBMQ processor. As a demonstration for a larger system, a simulation of a 10-qubit Ising model is also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of cyclic quantum codes, basing the construction not on the simplicity of the stabilizers, but rather on the simplicity of preparation of a code state (at least in the absence of noise). We show how certain known codes, such as a certain family of rotated two-dimensional toric codes, fall into this class, and we also give certain other examples at small sizes found by computer search. We finally discuss fault tolerant preparation of these codes.</description>

      <title>Computation of the Smooth Max-Mutual Information via Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an iterative algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) for computing the quantum smooth max-mutual information $I^\varepsilon_{\max}(\rho_{AB})$ of bipartite quantum states in any dimension. The algorithm is accurate if a rank condition for marginal states within the smoothing environment is satisfied and provides an upper bound otherwise. Central to our method is a novel SDP, for which we establish primal and dual formulations and prove strong duality. With the direct application of bounding the one-shot distillable key of a quantum state, this contribution extends SDP-based techniques in quantum information theory. Thereby it improves the capabilities to compute or estimate information measures with application to various quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Resource complexity of Symmetry Protected Topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pursue the identification of quantum resources carried by topological order, by evaluating quantum magic, quantified through the rank-$2$ Stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $\mathcal{M}_2$, in one-dimensional systems hosting symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTP). Focusing on models with an exact duality between an SPTP and a trivial one, namely the dimerized XX and the Cluster-Ising chains, we show that dual points exhibit identical amounts of magic, even thought they belong to distinct topological sectors. A subextensive asymmetry arises only under open boundary conditions, where edge effects break the duality, but this correction is non-topological and depends on microscopic parameters. These results stand in contrast to the case of topological frustration, where delocalized excitations enhance the magic logarithmically with system size. They also complement recent analyses in the literature, showing that the total magic is largely insensitive to the presence of topological order, hence suggesting that topological order is not necessarily a genuine computational resource.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrix via its classical counterpart from random measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preconditioning with the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is a popular approach in quantum variational algorithms. Yet the QFIM is costly to obtain directly, usually requiring more state preparation than its classical counterpart: the classical Fisher information matrix (CFIM). By revealing its relation to covariant measurement in quantum metrology, we show that averaging the classical Fisher information matrix over Haar-random measurement bases yields $\mathbb{E}_{U\sim\mu_H}[F^U(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = \frac{1}{2}Q(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ for pure states in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Furthermore, we obtain the variance of CFIM ($O(N^{-1})$) and establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds ($\exp(-\Theta(N)t^2)$), demonstrating that using few random measurement bases is sufficient to approximate the QFIM accurately, especially in high-dimensional settings. This work establishes a solid theoretical foundation for efficient quantum natural gradient methods via randomized measurements.</description>

      <title>Approximating the operator norm of local Hamiltonians via few quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression in Quantum Field Theories: Holography, Chaos, and Mixed-State Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has revealed that entanglement entropy growth in conformal field theories (CFTs) can be suppressed when a local operator quench interacts with a mixed-state excitation, providing a dual interpretation in terms of black hole scattering in AdS. This phenomenon, termed \emph{entanglement suppression}, opens several promising directions for exploration. In this proposal, I outline five distinct yet interconnected research trajectories: generalization to higher dimensions, the role of quantum chaos via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), the absence of suppression in integrable models, the extension to entanglement negativity as a probe of mixedness, and a geometric interpretation based on scattering cross sections in AdS. Each direction offers new insights into the interplay between holography, non-equilibrium dynamics, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Structure-Fair Quantum Circuit Complexity: An Auditable Information-Theoretic Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structure, such as symmetry or encoding, in a fair manner constitutes a core challenge in the benchmarking of quantum technologies. This paper introduces the Reference-Contingent Complexity (RCC), an information-theoretic measure calibrated by the available quantum operations. The core idea is to leverage the quantum relative entropy to quantify the deviation of a quantum state from its "structured vacuum"-namely, the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace-thereby only pricing the process of creating non-trivial information. Our central result is a key theorem that rigorously proves the RCC serves as a lower bound for the complexity of any universal quantum circuit. This lower bound is comprised of a linear dominant term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction term that accounts for non-uniformity in the spectral distribution. Crucially, we establish a set of operational protocols, grounded in tasks like quantum hypothesis testing, which make this theoretical lower bound experimentally "auditable." This work provides a "ruler" for quantum technology that is structure-fair and enables cross-platform comparison, thereby establishing a strictly verifiable constraint between the computational cost of the process and the structured information of the final state.</description>

      <title>Re-uploading quantum data: A universal function approximator for quantum inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.</description>

      <title>Radiation of "breathing" vortex electron packets in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>

      <title>Emulation of Coherent Absorption of Quantum Light in a Programmable Linear Photonic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption. Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes. Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 1 for single-photon states and 3.4 for NOON states, the latter exceeding the shot-noise limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4 for two-photon states. The experiment integrates quantum state generation, programmable photonic circuitry, and photon-number-resolving detection, establishing ancilla-assisted circuits as powerful tools for programmable quantum state engineering, filtering, multiplexed sensing, and nonunitary quantum simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic framework for anyonic systems in which the exchange phase is promoted from a fixed parameter to a fluctuating quantity. Starting from the Stratonovich stochastic Liouville equation, we perform the Stratonovich--It\^o conversion to obtain a Lindblad master equation that ties the dissipator directly to the distorted anyon algebra. This construction produces a statistics--dependent dephasing channel, with rates determined by the eigenstructure of the real symmetric correlation matrix $D_{ab}$. The eigenvectors of $D$ select which collective exchange currents -- equivalently, which irreducible representations of the system -- are protected from stochastic dephasing, providing a natural mechanism for decoherence-free subspaces and noise-induced exceptional points. The key result of our analysis is the universality of the optimal statistical angle: in the minimal two-site model with balanced gain and loss, the protected mode always minimizes its dephasing at $\theta^\star = \pi/2$, independent of the specific form of $D$. This robustness highlights a simple design rule for optimizing coherence in noisy anyonic systems, with direct implications for ultracold atomic realizations and other emerging platforms for fractional statistics.</description>

Abstract: A user, Alice, wants to get server Bob to implement a quantum computation for her. However, she wants to leave him blind to what she's doing. What are the minimal communication resources Alice must use in order to achieve information-theoretic security? In this paper, we consider a single step of the protocol, where Alice conveys to Bob whether or not he should implement a specific gate. We use an entropy-bounding technique to quantify the minimum number of qubits that Alice must send so that Bob cannot learn anything about the gate being implemented. We provide a protocol that saturates this bound. In this optimal protocol, the states that Alice sends may be entangled. For Clifford gates, we prove that it is sufficient for Alice to send separable states.</description>

      <title>Compiling Any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ into a (Succinct) Classical Interactive Argument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generic compiler that converts any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ protocol into a succinct interactive argument where the communication and the verifier are classical, and where post-quantum soundness relies on the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of the Learning with Errors ($\mathsf{LWE}$) problem. Prior to this work, such a compiler for $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ was given by Kalai, Lombardi, Vaikuntanathan and Yang (STOC 2022), but the post-quantum soundness of this compiler is still under investigation.
  More generally, our compiler can be applied to any $\mathsf{QIP}$ protocol which is sound only against semi-malicious provers that follow the prescribed protocol, but with possibly malicious initial state. Our compiler consists of two steps. We first show that if a language $\mathcal{L}$ has a $\mathsf{QIP}$ with semi-malicious soundness, where the prover runs in time $T$, then $\mathcal{L} \in \mathsf{QMATIME}(T)$. Then we construct a succinct classical argument for any such language, where the communication complexity grows polylogarithmically with $T$, under the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of $\mathsf{LWE}$.
  Note: After this work was finished, an independent and concurrent work (Baroni et al. 2025) resolved the question of quantum soundness of the KLVY compiler.</description>

      <title>QuIRK: Quantum-Inspired Re-uploading KAN</title>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks or KANs have shown the ability to outperform classical Deep Neural Networks, while using far fewer trainable parameters for regression problems on scientific domains. Even more powerful has been their interpretability due to their structure being composed of univariate B-Spline functions. This enables us to derive closed-form equations from trained KANs for a wide range of problems. This paper introduces a quantum-inspired variant of the KAN based on Quantum Data Re-uploading (DR) models. The Quantum-Inspired Re-uploading KAN or QuIRK model replaces B-Splines with single-qubit DR models as the univariate function approximator, allowing them to match or outperform traditional KANs while using even fewer parameters. This is especially apparent in the case of periodic functions. Additionally, since the model utilizes only single-qubit circuits, it remains classically tractable to simulate with straightforward GPU acceleration. Finally, we also demonstrate that QuIRK retains the interpretability advantages and the ability to produce closed-form solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Squeezing-Induced Algebraic Non-Hermitian Skin Effects and Ultra Spectral Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of multi-copy activation of genuine multipartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is, correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</description>

      <title>Probing non-Markovian qubit noise and modeling Post Markovian Master Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the noise characteristics of quantum processors is crucial when achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, typical qubit designs are often studied under the Markovian approximation, which does not fully capture realistic dynamics. Factors such as qubit-qubit coupling and extended bath correlation times can introduce significant non-Markovian effects into the noise processes. In this study, we employ the Post-Markovian Master Equation (PMME) formalism to characterize memory effects in the noise dynamics. We further experimentally validate the PMME framework using superconducting qubits on an IBM Quantum device, demonstrating clear non-Markovian behavior during circuit execution. Additionally, we quantify the crosstalk effect using an information-theoretic approach and reveal that crosstalk can dominate the observed non-Markovian effects in current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Spin Readout in a 22 nm Node Integrated Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing a quantum computer capable of broad and important applications is likely to require millions of addressable physical qubits, posing the challenge of large-scale integration of quantum systems with classical electronics. Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology has been used to develop a range of cryogenic electronic components for the control and readout of different qubit modalities interfaced on separate chips. However, recent measurements of quantum dots on this technology raise the tantalising prospect of realising control electronics and spin qubits on the same manufacturing platform, within a single integrated circuit (IC). Here, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout in addressable quantum dot devices within an IC fabricated using industry-standard 22 nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology. We achieve spin-to-charge conversion via a ramped energy-selective measurement, detected using a radio-frequency single-electron transistor and addressed by on-chip cryogenic electronics. The observation of consistent readout visibilities exceeding 90% and millisecond spin relaxation times in two nominally identical devices within the addressable array supports the reproducibility of the unit cell. The successful observation of spin readout using this CMOS process marks a key step towards realising highly scalable and integrated spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Classification of Transuranium Elements in Terms of `Winding' Numbers in the Bohr-Sommerfeld Model</title>

Abstract: We revisit the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model to explore hydrogen-like ions of Uranium ($Z=92$), Oganesson ($Z=118$), and hypothetical superheavy elements beyond. Although superseded by the Dirac equation and modern quantum electrodynamics, the semiclassical approach offers a historically and pedagogically valuable perspective. Using the Sommerfeld fine structure formula and computer algebra methods, we demonstrate the appearance of self-intersecting orbits in super strong Coulomb fields, beginning with Oganesson and hypothetical elements up to $Z\le137$. These orbits can be classified by their `winding' numbers, providing a simple topological description of Coulomb field strength in this framework. Our results highlight a conceptual bridge between early quantum theory and modern superheavy element physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interaction between light and high-frequency sound is a key area in integrated photonics, quantum and nonlinear optics, and quantum science. However, the typical suspended optomechanical structures suffer from poor thermal anchoring, making them susceptible to thermal noise arising from optical absorption. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, release-free silicon optomechanical crystal cavity (OMC) operating cryogenically with improved resilience to laser light. Relative to a suspended nanobeam OMC, we observe an 18 dB suppression of the thermo-optic effect, and the device sustains near-unity phonon occupation at 35 dB higher intracavity optical energy. Time-resolved measurements further reveal rapid initial thermalization governed by the mechanical decay time. With further material and design improvements in sight, these results bolster release-free systems on a chip as a path for low-noise and high-power classical and quantum electro-optomechanics, such as for frequency converters between microwave and optical photons.</description>

      <title>A source of heralded atom-photon entanglement for quantum networking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication in quantum networks suffers notoriously from photon loss. Resulting errors can be mitigated with a suitable measurement herald at the receiving node. However, waiting for a herald and communicating the measurement result back to the sender in a repeat-until-success strategy makes the protocol slow and prone to errors from false heralds such as detector dark counts. Here we implement an entanglement herald at the sending node by employing a cascaded two-photon emission of a single atom into two optical fiber cavities: The polarization of one photon is entangled with the spin of the atom, and the second photon heralds entanglement generation. We show that heralding improves the atom-photon entanglement in-fiber efficiency and fidelity to 68(3)% and 87(2)%, respectively. We highlight the potential of our source for noise-limited long-distance quantum communication by extending the range for constant fidelity or, alternatively, increasing the fidelity for a given distance.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Double-quantum-dot Andreev molecules: Phase diagrams and critical evaluation of effective models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the phase diagram of a parallel double-quantum-dot Andreev molecule, where the two quantum dots are coupled to a common superconducting lead. Using the numerical renormalization group method, we map out the evolution of the ground state across a wide parameter space of level detunings, size of the superconducting gap, lead couplings, and inter-dot coupling strength. The intricate phase diagrams feature singlet, doublet, and a relatively uncommon triplet ground states, with the latter being a distinct signature of strong lead-mediated interactions between the quantum dots. We benchmark the applicability of simplified effective models, including the atomic limit and zero-bandwidth approximations, in capturing the complex behavior of this parallel configuration. Our analysis reveals severe limitations of these models, underscoring the necessity for maximal caution when extrapolating beyond their tested validity. In particular, all effective models except for the extended version of the zero-bandwidth approximation failed in reproducing the triplet ground state and made several false predictions. These findings provide crucial insights for interpreting experimental observations and designing superconducting devices based on quantum-dot architectures.</description>

      <title>On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead, also known as the interacting resonant level model in quantum impurity physics. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08949v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dempster-Shafer structure is effective in classical settings for connecting set-valued hypotheses and representing structured ignorance, yet its practical use is limited by combination growth over focal sets and high conflict management. We observe a mathematical consistency between Dempster-Shafer structure and quantum superposition: elements of the power set form an orthogonal basis, and a basic probability assignment can be encoded as a normalized quantum state whose amplitudes respect mass value constraints. In this paper, we implement the information fusion and correction with Dempster-Shafer structure on quantum circuits, demonstrating that belief functions provide a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework.Furthermore, by leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel approaches for belief transfer. More broadly, this paper introduces a novel perspective on basic information representation in quantum AI models, proposing that belief functions are better suited than Bayesian approaches for handling uncertainty in quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the post-quantum security of succinct interactive arguments constructed from interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) and vector commitment schemes. We prove that an interactive variant of the BCS transformation is secure in the standard model against quantum adversaries when the vector commitment scheme is collapsing. Our proof builds on and extends prior work on the post-quantum security of Kilians succinct interactive argument, which is instead based on probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs). We introduce a new quantum rewinding strategy that works across any number of rounds. As a consequence of our results, we obtain standard-model post-quantum secure succinct arguments with the best asymptotic complexity known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a static impurity, modeled by a localized barrier, in a one-dimensional mesoscopic system comprised of strongly correlated repulsive SU($N$)-symmetric fermions. For a mesoscopic sized ring under the effect of an artificial gauge field, we analyze the energy spectrum, the particle density and the current flowing through the impurity at varying interaction strengths, barrier heights, and number of components. We find that the physics of the system is governed by the competition between effective single-particle process and the formation of a high-stiffness spin-correlated state associated to the phenomenon of fractionalization of the flux quantum characterizing the $N$-component fermionic system. Our findings provide a route to probe the response of SU($N$) fermions to effective magnetic fields; at the same time, they hold significance for fundamental understanding of localized impurity problems.</description>

      <title>Universal Reconstruction of Complex Magnetic Profiles with Minimum Prior Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding intricate magnetic structures in materials is essential for advancing materials science, spintronics, and geology. Recent developments of quantum-enabled magnetometers, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, have enabled direct imaging of magnetic field distributions across a wide range of magnetic profiles. However, reconstructing the magnetization from an experimentally measured magnetic field map is a complex inverse problem, further complicated by measurement noise, finite spatial resolution, and variations in sample-to-sensor distance. In this work, we present a novel and efficient GPU-accelerated method for reconstructing spatially varying magnetization density from measured magnetic fields with minimal prior assumptions. We validate our method by simulating diverse magnetic structures under realistic experimental conditions, including multi-domain ferromagnetism and magnetic spin textures such as skyrmion, anti-skyrmion, and meron. Experimentally, we reconstruct the magnetization of a micrometer-scale Apollo lunar mare basalt (sample 10003,184) and a nanometer-scale twisted double-trilayer CrI3. The basalt exhibits soft ferromagnetic domains consistent with previous paleomagnetic studies, whereas the CrI3 system reveals a well-defined hexagonal magnetic Moire superlattice. Our approach provides a versatile and universal tool for investigating complex magnetization profiles, paving the way for future quantum sensing experiments.</description>

      <title>Thouless quantum walks in topological flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge symmetries are cornerstones of modern theoretical physics, underlying fundamental interactions and the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. However, their potential to control quantum coherence, entangle- ment, and transport in engineered quantum systems remains to a large extent unexplored. In this work, we propose utilizing non-Abelian Thouless pumping to realize one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks on topological lattices char- acterized by degenerate flat bands. Through carefully designed pumping cycles, we implement different classes of holonomic coin and shift operators. This frame- work allows for the construction of quantum walks that encode the topological and geometric properties of the underlying system. Remarkably, the resulting evolution exhibits parity symmetry breaking and gives rise to a dynamical pro- cess governed by a Weyl-like equation, highlighting the deep connection between parity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in the system.</description>

      <title>Fitness landscape for quantum state tomography from neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a direct connection between static structure factors and quantum ground states for two-spin interaction Hamiltonians was proven. This suggests the possibility of quantum state tomography from neutron scattering. Here, we investigate the associated fitness landscape numerically. We find a linear relationship between the mean square distances of the structure factors and the associated state overlaps, implying a well-behaved fitness landscape. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that the approach can be generalized to thermal equilibrium states. We also extend the arguments to the cases of applied magnetic fields and finite clusters.</description>

      <title>The Wehrl-type entropy conjecture for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states: cases of equality and stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note, we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials and deduce a corresponding Faber-Krahn inequality. A sharp quantitative form of the bound by Lieb and Solovej is also proved.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves decohere quantum superpositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity is a crucial step towards unifying these two fundamental ideas. Recent theoretical developments have explored how global properties of spacetime would cause a quantum spatial superposition to lose coherence. In particular, this loss of coherence is closely related to the memory effect, which is a prominent feature of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore how a burst of gravitational radiation from a far-away source would decohere a quantum superposition. We identify the individual contributions to the decoherence from the memory and oscillatory components of the gravitational wave source, corresponding to soft and hard graviton emissions, respectively. In general, the memory contributions dominate, while the oscillatory component of the decoherence is strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work demonstrates how quantum systems can lose coherence from interactions with a classical gravitational field. We also comment on the electromagnetic analogue of this effect and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time classical versus quantum algorithms for representation theoretic multiplicities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11645v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $\sim 80\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <title>Observing Spatial Charge and Spin Correlations in a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal nonlocal anticorrelations in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyper-Ramsey protocols effectively reduce AC-Stark shifts in probing ultra-narrow optical clock transitions but they remain sensitive to laser intensity noise, decoherence, frequency drifts, and low-frequency perturbations. We address these limitations by incorporating dynamical decoupling, using sequences of rotary Hahn-echo pulses that toggle the probe frequency detuning and phase between opposite signs. Implementing time-optimized Eulerian cycling circuits of multiple refocusing pulses, we generate high-contrast hyper-Ramsey interferences that are completely free from AC-Stark shifts and robust against environmental noise and laser probe parameters imperfections. Fault- tolerant dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks are a significant step toward universal, noise-resilient quantum sensors, enabling fault-tolerant metrology for searches about new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <title>Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)\setminus\{1\}$, $p&gt;0$ and positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, we consider the quasi-extension $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A^p,B^p)^{1/p}$ of several $\alpha$-weighted geometric type matrix means $\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A,B)$ such as the $\alpha$-weighted geometric mean in Kubo--Ando's sense, the R\'enyi mean, etc. The log-majorization $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\prec_{\log}\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ is examined for pairs $(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})$ of those $\alpha$-weighted geometric type means. The joint concavity/convexity of the trace functions $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}$ is also discussed based on theory of quantum divergences.</description>

      <title>Scalable accuracy gains from postselection in quantum error correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</description>
