      <title>The steady-states of splitter networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce splitter networks, which abstract the behavior of conveyor belts found in the video game Factorio. Based on this definition, we show how to compute the steady-state of a splitter network. Then, leveraging insights from the players community, we provide multiple designs of splitter networks capable of load-balancing among several conveyor belts, and prove that any load-balancing network on $n$ belts must have $\Omega(n \log n)$ nodes. Incidentally, we establish connections between splitter networks and various concepts including flow algorithms, flows with equality constraints, Markov chains and the Knuth-Yao theorem about sampling over rational distributions using a fair coin.</description>

      <title>BFS versus DFS for random targets in ordered trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a search from the root of an ordered tree with $n$ edges to some target node at a fixed distance $\ell$ from that root. We compare the average time complexity of the breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms, when the target node is selected uniformly at random among all nodes at level $\ell$ in the ordered trees with $n$ edges. Intuition suggests that BFS should have better average performance when $\ell$ is small, while DFS must have an advantage when $\ell$ is large. But where exactly is the threshold, as a function of $n$, and is it unique? We obtain explicit formulas for the expected number of steps of both BFS and DFS, by using results on the occupation measure of Brownian excursions, as well as a combinatorial proof of an identity related to lattice paths. This allows us to show that there exists a unique constant $\lambda\approx 0.789004$, such that in expectation BFS is asymptotically faster than DFS if and only if $\ell\leq \lambda\sqrt{n}$. Furthermore, we find the asymptotic average time complexity of BFS in the given setting for any class of Galton$\unicode{x2013}$Watson trees, including binary trees and ordered trees. Finally, we introduce the truncated DFS algorithm, which performs better than both BFS and DFS when $\ell$ is known in advance, and we find a formula evaluating the average time complexity of this algorithm.</description>

      <title>Graphs whose vertices of degree at least 2 lie in a triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pendant vertex is one of degree one and an isolated vertex has degree zero. A neighborhood star-free (NSF for short) graph is one in which every vertex is contained in a triangle except pendant vertices and isolated vertices. This class has been considered before for several contexts. In the present paper, we study the complexity of the dominating induced matching (DIM) problem and the perfect edge domination (PED) problem for NSF graphs. We prove the corresponding decision problems are NP-Complete for several of its subclasses. As an added value of this study, we have shown three connected variants of planar positive 1in3SAT are also NP-Complete. Since these variants are more basic in complexity theory context than many graph problems, these results can be useful to prove that other problems are NP-Complete.</description>

      <title>Maximum values of the Sombor-index-like graph invariants of trees and connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of novel vertex-degree-based invariants was introduced by Gutman, denoted by \newline $SO_1, SO_2, \ldots,SO_6$. These invariants were constructed through geometric reasoning based on a new graph invariant framework. Motivated by proposed open problems in [Z. Tang, Q. Li, H. Deng, \textit{Trees with Extremal Values of the Sombor-Index-Like Graph Invariants}, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. \textbf{90} (2023) 203-222], we have found the maximum values of $SO_5$ and $SO_6$ in the set of molecular trees with a given number of vertices, respectively, and we have found the maximum value of $SO_5$ in a class of connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Packing $K_r$s in bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a maximum-cardinality set of $r$-cliques in an undirected graph of fixed maximum degree $\Delta$, subject to the cliques in that set being either vertex-disjoint or edge-disjoint. It is known for $r=3$ that the vertex-disjoint (edge-disjoint) problem is solvable in linear time if $\Delta=3$ ($\Delta=4$) but APX-hard if $\Delta \geq 4$ ($\Delta \geq 5$).
  We generalise these results to an arbitrary but fixed $r \geq 3$, and provide a complete complexity classification for both the vertex- and edge-disjoint variants in graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$.
  Specifically, we show that the vertex-disjoint problem is solvable in linear time if $\Delta &lt; 3r/2 - 1$, solvable in polynomial time if $\Delta &lt; 5r/3 - 1$, and APX-hard if $\Delta \geq \lceil 5r/3 \rceil - 1$. We also show that if $r\geq 6$ then the above implications also hold for the edge-disjoint problem. If $r \leq 5$, then the edge-disjoint problem is solvable in linear time if $\Delta &lt; 3r/2 - 1$, solvable in polynomial time if $\Delta \leq 2r - 2$, and APX-hard if $\Delta &gt; 2r - 2$.</description>

      <title>Bounding the chromatic number of dense digraphs by arc neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a directed graph is the minimum number of induced acyclic subdigraphs that cover its vertex set, and accordingly, the chromatic number of a tournament is the minimum number of transitive subtournaments that cover its vertex set. The neighborhood of an arc $uv$ in a tournament $T$ is the set of vertices that form a directed triangle with arc $uv$. We show that if the neighborhood of every arc in a tournament has bounded chromatic number, then the whole tournament has bounded chromatic number. This holds more generally for oriented graphs with bounded independence number, and we extend our proof from tournaments to this class of dense digraphs. As an application, we prove the equivalence of a conjecture of El-Zahar and Erd\H{o}s and a recent conjecture of Nguyen, Scott and Seymour relating the structure of graphs and tournaments with high chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Information Structures in RLHF: Reward Generalization from a Graph Theory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a trilemma in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): the incompatibility between highly diverse contexts, low labeling cost, and reliable alignment performance. We mitigate such incompatibility through the design of dataset information structures during reward modeling, and introduce the Induced Bayesian Network (IBN), the first theory of reward generalization capable of generating substantial verified predictions on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first reexamine the RLHF process and propose a theoretical framework portraying it as an autoencoding process over text distributions. Our framework formalizes the RLHF objective of ensuring distributional consistency between human preference and LLM behavior. Then, based on this framework, we introduce the IBN to analyze generalization in the reward modeling stage of RLHF. Drawing from random graph theory and causal analysis, it enables empirically grounded derivation of generalization error bounds, a key improvement over classical theories of generalization. Finally, an insight from our analysis is the superiority of the tree-based information structure in reward modeling, compared to chain-based baselines in conventional RLHF methods. With IBN, we derive that in complex contexts with limited data, the tree-based reward model (RM), trained on a tree-structured preference dataset, induces up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times less variance than the baseline, where $n$ is the dataset size. As validation, we demonstrate that on three NLP tasks, the tree-based RM achieves 65% win rate on average against chain-based baselines. It shows that alignment performance can be gained for free via the design of dataset information structure, without the need for any other changes.</description>
