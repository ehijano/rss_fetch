      <title>Generalized Cuts and Grothendieck Covers: a Primal-Dual Approximation Framework Extending the Goemans--Williamson Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a primal-dual framework for randomized approximation algorithms utilizing semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. Our framework pairs a continuum of APX-complete problems including MaxCut, Max2Sat, MaxDicut, and more generally, Max-Boolean Constraint Satisfaction and MaxQ (maximization of a positive semidefinite quadratic form over the hypercube) with new APX-complete problems which are stated as convex optimization problems with exponentially many variables. These new dual counterparts, based on what we call Grothendieck covers, range from fractional cut covering problems (for MaxCut) to tensor sign covering problems (for MaxQ). For each of these problem pairs, our framework transforms the randomized approximation algorithms with the best known approximation factors for the primal problems to randomized approximation algorithms for their dual counterparts with reciprocal approximation factors which are tight with respect to the Unique Games Conjecture. For each APX-complete pair, our algorithms solve a single SDP relaxation and generate feasible solutions for both problems which also provide approximate optimality certificates for each other. Our work utilizes techniques from areas of randomized approximation algorithms, convex optimization, spectral sparsification, as well as Chernoff-type concentration results for random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a $(1.796+\epsilon)$-approximation for the minimum sum coloring problem on chordal graphs, improving over the previous 3.591-approximation by Gandhi et al. [2005]. To do so, we also design the first polynomial-time approximation scheme for the maximum $k$-colorable subgraph problem in chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>VertiMRF: Differentially Private Vertical Federated Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data synthesis is a promising solution to share data for various downstream analytic tasks without exposing raw data. However, without a theoretical privacy guarantee, a synthetic dataset would still leak some sensitive information. Differential privacy is thus widely adopted to safeguard data synthesis by strictly limiting the released information. This technique is advantageous yet presents significant challenges in the vertical federated setting, where data attributes are distributed among different data parties. The main challenge lies in maintaining privacy while efficiently and precisely reconstructing the correlation among cross-party attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called VertiMRF, designed explicitly for generating synthetic data in the vertical setting and providing differential privacy protection for all information shared from data parties. We introduce techniques based on the Flajolet-Martin sketch (or frequency oracle) for encoding local data satisfying differential privacy and estimating cross-party marginals. We provide theoretical privacy and utility proof for encoding in this multi-attribute data. Collecting the locally generated private Markov Random Field (MRF) and the sketches, a central server can reconstruct a global MRF, maintaining the most useful information. Additionally, we introduce two techniques tailored for datasets with large attribute domain sizes, namely dimension reduction and consistency enforcement. These two techniques allow flexible and inconsistent binning strategies of local private MRF and the data sketching module, which can preserve information to the greatest extent. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of VertiMRF. End-to-end comparisons demonstrate the superiority of VertiMRF, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.</description>

      <title>Exact Minimum Weight Spanners via Column Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a weighted graph $G$, a minimum weight $\alpha$-spanner is a least-weight subgraph $H\subseteq G$ that preserves minimum distances between all node pairs up to a factor of $\alpha$. There are many results on heuristics and approximation algorithms, including a recent investigation of their practical performance [20]. Exact approaches, in contrast, have long been denounced as impractical: The first exact ILP (integer linear program) method [48] from 2004 is based on a model with exponentially many path variables, solved via column generation. A second approach [2], modeling via arc-based multicommodity flow, was presented in 2019. In both cases, only graphs with 40-100 nodes were reported to be solvable.
  In this paper, we briefly report on a theoretical comparison between these two models from a polyhedral point of view, and then concentrate on improvements and engineering aspects. We evaluate their performance in a large-scale empirical study. We report that our tuned column generation approach, based on multicriteria shortest path computations, is able to solve instances with over 16000 nodes within 13 minutes. Furthermore, now knowing optimal solutions for larger graphs, we are able to investigate the quality of the strongest known heuristic on reasonably sized instances for the first time.</description>

      <title>Online sorting and online TSP: randomized, stochastic, and high-dimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the online sorting problem, $n$ items are revealed one by one and have to be placed (immediately and irrevocably) into empty cells of a size-$n$ array. The goal is to minimize the sum of absolute differences between items in consecutive cells. This natural problem was recently introduced by Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta, and Kleist (SODA 2023) as a tool in their study of online geometric packing problems. They showed that when the items are reals from the interval $[0,1]$ a competitive ratio of $O(\sqrt{n})$ is achievable, and no deterministic algorithm can improve this ratio asymptotically.
  In this paper, we extend and generalize the study of online sorting in three directions:
  - randomized: we settle the open question of Aamand et al. by showing that the $O(\sqrt{n})$ competitive ratio for the online sorting of reals cannot be improved even with the use of randomness;
  - stochastic: we consider inputs consisting of $n$ samples drawn uniformly at random from an interval, and give an algorithm with an improved competitive ratio of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4})$. The result reveals connections between online sorting and the design of efficient hash tables;
  - high-dimensional: we show that $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$-competitive online sorting is possible even for items from $\mathbb{R}^d$, for arbitrary fixed $d$, in an adversarial model. This can be viewed as an online variant of the classical TSP problem where tasks (cities to visit) are revealed one by one and the salesperson assigns each task (immediately and irrevocably) to its timeslot. Along the way, we also show a tight $O(\log{n})$-competitiveness result for uniform metrics, i.e., where items are of different types and the goal is to order them so as to minimize the number of switches between consecutive items of different types.</description>

      <title>Investigation on centrality measures and opinion dynamics in two-layer networks with replica nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine two-layer networks and centrality measures defined on them. The propose two fast and accurate algorithms to approximate the game-theoretic centrality measures and examine connection between centrality measures and characteristics of opinion dynamic processes on such networks. As an example, we consider a Zachary's karate club social network and extend it by adding the second (internal) layer of communication. Internal layer represents the idea that individuals can share their real opinions with their close friends. The structures of the external and internal layers may be different. As characteristics of of opinion dynamic processes we mean consensus time and winning rate of a particular opinion. We find significantly strong positive correlation between internal graph density and consensus time, and significantly strong negative correlation between centrality of authoritative nodes and consensus time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the differentially private (DP) empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem under the semi-sensitive DP setting where only some features are sensitive. This generalizes the Label DP setting where only the label is sensitive. We give improved upper and lower bounds on the excess risk for DP-ERM. In particular, we show that the error only scales polylogarithmically in terms of the sensitive domain size, improving upon previous results that scale polynomially in the sensitive domain size (Ghazi et al., 2021).</description>

      <title>Cuts in Graphs with Matroid Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {\sc Vertex $(s, t)$-Cut} and {\sc Vertex Multiway Cut} are two fundamental graph separation problems in algorithmic graph theory. We study matroidal generalizations of these problems, where in addition to the usual input, we are given a representation $R \in \mathbb{F}^{r \times n}$ of a linear matroid $\mathcal{M} = (V(G), \mathcal{I})$ of rank $r$ in the input, and the goal is to determine whether there exists a vertex subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ that has the required cut properties, as well as is independent in the matroid $\mathcal{M}$. We refer to these problems as {\sc Independent Vertex $(s, t)$-cut}, and {\sc Independent Multiway Cut}, respectively. We show that these problems are fixed-parameter tractable ({\sf FPT}) when parameterized by the solution size (which can be assumed to be equal to the rank of the matroid $\mathcal{M}$). These results are obtained by exploiting the recent technique of flow augmentation [Kim et al.~STOC '22], combined with a dynamic programming algorithm on flow-paths \'a la [Feige and Mahdian,~STOC '06] that maintains a representative family of solutions w.r.t.~the given matroid [Marx, TCS '06; Fomin et al., JACM]. As a corollary, we also obtain {\sf FPT} algorithms for the independent version of {\sc Odd Cycle Transversal}. Further, our results can be generalized to other variants of the problems, e.g., weighted versions, or edge-deletion versions.</description>

      <title>QSketch: An Efficient Sketch for Weighted Cardinality Estimation in Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating cardinality, i.e., the number of distinct elements, of a data stream is a fundamental problem in areas like databases, computer networks, and information retrieval. This study delves into a broader scenario where each element carries a positive weight. Unlike traditional cardinality estimation, limited research exists on weighted cardinality, with current methods requiring substantial memory and computational resources, challenging for devices with limited capabilities and real-time applications like anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose QSketch, a memory-efficient sketch method for estimating weighted cardinality in streams. QSketch uses a quantization technique to condense continuous variables into a compact set of integer variables, with each variable requiring only 8 bits, making it 8 times smaller than previous methods. Furthermore, we leverage dynamic properties during QSketch generation to significantly enhance estimation accuracy and achieve a lower time complexity of $O(1)$ for updating estimations upon encountering a new element. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that QSketch is approximately 30\% more accurate and two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, using only $1/8$ of the memory.</description>

      <title>Random-Order Online Independent Set of Intervals and Hyperrectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Maximum Independent Set of Hyperrectangles problem, we are given a set of $n$ (possibly overlapping) $d$-dimensional axis-aligned hyperrectangles, and the goal is to find a subset of non-overlapping hyperrectangles of maximum cardinality. For $d=1$, this corresponds to the classical Interval Scheduling problem, where a simple greedy algorithm returns an optimal solution. In the offline setting, for $d$-dimensional hyperrectangles, polynomial time $(\log n)^{O(d)}$-approximation algorithms are known. However, the problem becomes notably challenging in the online setting, where the input objects (hyperrectangles) appear one by one in an adversarial order, and on the arrival of an object, the algorithm needs to make an immediate and irrevocable decision whether or not to select the object while maintaining the feasibility. Even for interval scheduling, an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound is known on the competitive ratio.
  To circumvent these negative results, in this work, we study the online maximum independent set of axis-aligned hyperrectangles in the random-order arrival model, where the adversary specifies the set of input objects which then arrive in a uniformly random order. Starting from the prototypical secretary problem, the random-order model has received significant attention to study algorithms beyond the worst-case competitive analysis. Surprisingly, we show that the problem in the random-order model almost matches the best-known offline approximation guarantees, up to polylogarithmic factors. In particular, we give a simple $(\log n)^{O(d)}$-competitive algorithm for $d$-dimensional hyperrectangles in this model, which runs in $\tilde{O_d}(n)$ time. Our approach also yields $(\log n)^{O(d)}$-competitive algorithms in the random-order model for more general objects such as $d$-dimensional fat objects and ellipsoids. Furthermore, our guarantees hold with high probability.</description>

      <title>Toward Self-Adjusting k-ary Search Tree Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Datacenter networks are becoming increasingly flexible with the incorporation of new networking technologies, such as optical circuit switches. These technologies allow for programmable network topologies that can be reconfigured to better serve network traffic, thus enabling a trade-off between the benefits (i.e., shorter routes) and costs of reconfigurations (i.e., overhead). Self-Adjusting Networks (SANs) aim at addressing this trade-off by exploiting patterns in network traffic, both when it is revealed piecewise (online dynamic topologies) or known in advance (offline static topologies). In this paper, we take the first steps toward Self-Adjusting k-ary tree networks. These are more powerful generalizations of existing binary search tree networks (like SplayNets), which have been at the core of SAN designs. k-ary search tree networks are a natural generalization offering nodes of higher degrees, reduced route lengths for a fixed number of nodes, and local routing in spite of reconfigurations. We first compute an offline (optimal) static network for arbitrary traffic patterns in $O(n^3 \cdot k)$ time via dynamic programming, and also improve the bound to $O(n^2 \cdot k)$ for the special case of uniformly distributed traffic. Then, we present a centroid-based topology of the network that can be used both in the offline static and the online setting. In the offline uniform-workload case, we construct this quasi-optimal network in linear time $O(n)$ and, finally, we present online self-adjusting k-ary search tree versions of SplayNet. We evaluate experimentally our new structure for $k=2$ (allowing for a comparison with existing SplayNets) on real and synthetic network traces. Our results show that this approach works better than SplayNet in most of the real network traces and in average to low locality synthetic traces, and is only little inferior to SplayNet in all remaining traces.</description>

      <title>Structural and Combinatorial Properties of 2-swap Word Permutation Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the graph induced by the $\textit{2-swap}$ permutation on words with a fixed Parikh vector. A $2$-swap is defined as a pair of positions $s = (i, j)$ where the word $w$ induced by the swap $s$ on $v$ is $v[1] v[2] \dots v[i - 1] v[j] v[i+1] \dots v[j - 1] v[i] v[j + 1] \dots v[n]$. With these permutations, we define the $\textit{Configuration Graph}$, $G(P)$ defined over a given Parikh vector. Each vertex in $G(P)$ corresponds to a unique word with the Parikh vector $P$, with an edge between any pair of words $v$ and $w$ if there exists a swap $s$ such that $v \circ s = w$. We provide several key combinatorial properties of this graph, including the exact diameter of this graph, the clique number of the graph, and the relationships between subgraphs within this graph. Additionally, we show that for every vertex in the graph, there exists a Hamiltonian path starting at this vertex. Finally, we provide an algorithm enumerating these paths from a given input word of length $n$ with a delay of at most $O(\log n)$ between outputting edges, requiring $O(n \log n)$ preprocessing.</description>

Abstract: Professional networks -- the social networks among people in a given line of work -- can serve as a conduit for job prospects and other opportunities. Here we propose a model for the formation of such networks and the transfer of opportunities within them. In our theoretical model, individuals strategically connect with others to maximize the probability that they receive opportunities from them. We explore how professional networks balance connectivity, where connections facilitate opportunity transfers to those who did not get them from outside sources, and congestion, where some individuals receive too many opportunities from their connections and waste some of them.
  We show that strategic individuals are over-connected at equilibrium relative to a social optimum, leading to a price of anarchy for which we derive nearly tight asymptotic bounds. We also show that, at equilibrium, individuals form connections to those who provide similar benefit to them as they provide to others. Thus, our model provides a microfoundation in professional networking contexts for the fundamental sociological principle of homophily, that "similarity breeds connection," which in our setting is realized as a form of status homophily based on alignment in individual benefit. We further explore how, even if individuals are a priori equally likely to receive opportunities from outside sources, equilibria can be unequal, and we provide nearly tight bounds on how unequal they can be. Finally, we explore the ability for online platforms to intervene to improve social welfare and show that natural heuristics may result in adverse effects at equilibrium. Our simple model allows for a surprisingly rich analysis of coordination problems in professional networks and suggests many directions for further exploration.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. Taking a scaling limit, we prove a similar result for functions $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ that are 1-Lipschitz in the $\ell^1$ metric of ${\Bbb R}^n$ and where the expectation is taken with respect to the standard Gaussian measure in ${\Bbb R}^n$. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>
