      <title>Holographic codes and bulk RG flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the coarse-graining of holographic quantum error correcting codes under a generalized notion of bulk renormalization-group flow. In particular, we study the renormalization under this flow of the $A/4G$ term in the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula and in its R\'enyi generalization. This provides a general quantum code perspective on the arguments of Susskind and Uglum. Specifically, given a 'UV' code with two-sided recovery and appropriately flat entanglement spectrum together with a set of 'seed' states in the UV code, we explicitly construct an 'IR' code with corresponding properties which contains the given seed states and is of minimal size in a sense we describe.</description>

      <title>Dirac QNM spectrum from twisted semiclassical gauge theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted Abelian gauge theory coupled to a noncommutative (NC) Dirac field is studied in order to infer
  the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the fermion matter perturbations in the vicinity of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole. The action functional of the theory is invariant under the truncated NC local $U(1)_{\star}$ gauge transformations that keep the gravitational background intact. The latter, being a classical gravitational background unaffected by the
  NC local gauge transformations, makes the theory semiclassical. The most prominent feature of the QNM spectrum is the splitting in the total angular momentum projection due to the noncommutativity induced $SO(3) \rightarrow U(1)$ symmetry breaking pattern.</description>

      <title>Probing the bubble interior with entanglement entropy and bulk-cone singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the thin wall approximation, we study a class of asymptotically AdS black holes which contain a spherically symmetric vacuum bubble with a different (positive or negative) cosmological constant. Collapsing, expanding, and static bubble solutions are considered. Among these, expanding bubbles with positive cosmological constant can provide a way to apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to describe the physics of an expanding universe. We systematically study the causal structure of the solutions as a function of the cosmological constant, the mass of the black hole, and the tension of the bubble. We then compute the holographic entanglement entropy for a class of boundary subregions using extremal codimension-two surfaces as a probe. For collapsing bubbles, we find examples in which the entanglement entropy also explores the geometry inside the black hole bifurcation surface. As a complementary way to probe the interior of the bubble, we investigate almost-null radial geodesics related to the bulk-cone singularities of boundary two-point correlators. While the bulk-cone singularities for collapsing and expanding bubbles are consistent with thermalization at late time, static bubbles violate thermalization and exhibit properties similar to those of scar states.</description>

      <title>Coherence and Quantum Stability of Relativistic Superfluid States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum dynamics of a relativistic homogeneous superfluid in a complex scalar field theory. Unlike zero-charge condensates, which undergo quantum evaporation due to internal number-changing processes, we show that $U(1)$ superfluids preserve their internal coherence indefinitely in this theory. In particular, although not Hamiltonian eigenstates, these configurations are stable in the full quantum theory to all orders in perturbation theory. This is demonstrated by explicitly constructing the corresponding quantum state and studying its dynamics. Crucially, maintaining stability requires the quantum state to go beyond a naive coherent-state construction: specific non-Gaussian corrections are essential for having a stationary state. The resulting state is identified as the interacting vacuum of the superfluid fluctuations, which also serves as the ground state of the modified Hamiltonian $\hat{{H}}-\mu \hat{Q}$, with $\mu$ the full-fledged quantum chemical potential and $\hat{Q}$ the $U(1)$ charge. Finally, we check that the phonon mode remains gapless once one-loop corrections are included, confirming the robustness of the Goldstone theorem beyond the semiclassical regime, even in systems with a spontaneously broken Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>An $L$-function Approach to Two-Dimensional Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in the language of analytic number theory. Attached to the torus partition function of every two-dimensional CFT is a self-dual, degree-4 $L$-function of root number $\varepsilon=1$, with a universal gamma factor determined by $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and local conformal invariance. Due to the richness of CFT operator spectra, these are not, in general, standard $L$-functions. We explicate their analytic structure, exploring the interplay of the Hadamard product over non-trivial zeros with the generalized Dirichlet series over CFT scalar primary conformal dimensions. We derive a zero sum rule in terms of the spectrum, and a global zero density bound in terms of the spectral gap. Convergence of the series representation implies square root cancellation of the degeneracies; we relate this to random matrix behavior of high-energy level spacings. Random matrix universality of the CFT implies "Riemann zeta universality" of the $L$-function: an average relation between the $L$-function on the critical line and Riemann zeta on the 1-line. This in turn yields a subconvexity bound. For a compact free boson, the $L$-function is a product of Riemann zeta functions times an analytic factor. Extensions to correlator $L$-functions and spinning spectra are briefly discussed.
  In the course of this work, we are led to sharpen the notion of random matrix universality in two-dimensional CFTs. We formulate a precise version of the following standalone conjecture, logically independent of $L$-functions: in unitary, compact Virasoro CFTs with central charge $c&gt;1$, fixed-spin primary spectra at high energy are asymptotically simple, with random extreme gap statistics.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Entropy from String Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the notion of string entanglement in string theory, which aims to study entanglement between worldsheet Hilbert spaces rather than entanglement between spacetime Hilbert spaces defined on a time slice in spacetime. Applying this framework to the FZZ duality and its extension to a three-dimensional black hole, we argue that the thermal entropy of 2d and 3d black holes is accounted for by the string entanglement entropy between folded strings arising in the dual sine-Liouville CFT. We compute this via a worldsheet replica method and show that it decomposes into two parts, which we call the vertex operator contribution and the replica contribution. The former can be evaluated analytically and is shown to coincide with the black hole thermal entropies in the low temperature limit in large D dimensions. Although a computation of the latter is left as an open problem, we present evidence that it captures the remaining portion of the black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Symbols from Bi-Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic framework for the analysis of analytic properties of finite Feynman integrals that are multiple polylogarithms. Based on the Feynman parameter representation in complex projective space, we make a complete classification of logarithmic singularities of the integral on its principal branch, by what we call touching configurations -- a geometric relationship between the integrand singularity and linear subspaces tied to boundary elements of the integral contour. These on the one hand indicate first entries of the symbol of the integral, and on the other hand induce a special set of new integrals that we call elementary discontinuities. These elementary discontinuities are derived through an operation called bi-projection, and actual discontinuities of the integral across logarithmic branch cuts are their linear combinations. By recursively applying the same analysis to the induced integrals one can fully construct the symbol of the original integral. We explicitly show how this analysis works at one loop in a massless hexagon and a box with two massive and two massless loop propagators. This framework may naturally extend to higher-loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Schwinger and Schwinger-Thirring model on squashed S$^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwinger model is a model of a two-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to a Dirac fermion. It is an interesting model that exhibits phenomena like confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. In this paper, we study the massless Schwinger and Schwinger-Thirring model on a squashed sphere, $S^2_b$. These models are examples of interacting non-supersymmetric theories where the exact computations in the coupling parameter are possible. Squashing provides a smooth deformation of the metric away from the spherical geometry. We compute the partition function, and the expectation value of the Wilson loop and the fermion condensate exactly in the Schwinger and Schwinger-Thirring model as a function of the squashing parameter and the coupling constant. We then obtain variations in these quantities in response to the squashing deformation. These contain information about correlation functions involving the energy-momentum tensor. We evaluate these variations in the first order in the squashing parameter and exactly in the coupling constant.</description>

      <title>The Courant-Hilbert construction in 4D Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Courant-Hilbert (CH) construction of integrable deformations of a two-dimensional principal chiral model (2D PCM) in the context of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons (4D CS) theory. According to this construction, an integrable deformation of 2D PCM is characterized by a boundary function. As a result, the master formula obtained from the 4D CS theory should be corrected by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor so as to support the CH construction. We present some examples of deformation including the $T\bar{T}$-deformation, the root $T\bar{T}$-deformation, the two-parameter mixed deformation, and a logarithmic deformation. Finally, we discuss some generalizations and potential applications of this CH construction.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian for the massless Dirac field on a segment with an inhomogeneous background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of an interval for the massless Dirac field in an inhomogeneous background on a segment where the same boundary condition at both its endpoints is imposed, and in its ground state. We focus on a class of metrics that are Weyl equivalent to the flat metric through a Weyl factor that depends only on the spatial coordinate. The explicit form of the entanglement Hamiltonian is written as the sum of a local and a bilocal term. The weight function of the local term allows us to study a contour function for the entanglement entropies. For the model obtained from the continuum limit of the rainbow chain, the analytic expressions are compared with exact numerical results from the lattice, showing an excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Holographic defect CFTs with Dirichlet end-of-the-world branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a holographic model of defect conformal field theories (DCFTs) with defects of codimension greater than one. Our construction generalizes the AdS/BCFT model by anchoring the end-of-the-world brane on defects at the asymptotic AdS boundary and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions for the metric on the brane. We compute the defect entropy and defect free energy and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-function is always non-negative. We further study holographic defect-localized RG flows triggered by a localized scalar field on the brane and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds. We also verify that our model reproduces the expected forms of correlation functions in DCFTs.</description>

      <title>The double copy as a doppelg\"{a}nger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double copy relates scattering amplitudes and classical solutions in non-abelian gauge theories and gravity. As such, it is usually expressed in the conventional second-order formalisms in both theories corresponding to standard Yang-Mills theory, and the Einstein--Hilbert action in General Relativity. In this paper, we instead consider alternative formulations of gravity, which are known to terminate at finite order in the coupling at Lagrangian level. We focus in particular on the Chern--Simons--Witten (CSW) formulation in 2+1 dimensions, and argue that the double copy then becomes a doppelg\"{a}nger relationship between gauge theory and gravity, allowing straightforward replacement of generators and structure constants in both theories. We show how explicit (multiple) static point-source solutions can be mapped in the two approaches, and use the CSW formalism to examine when double copies are expected to be possible, and when not. In addition, we present an explicit double copy between the Wong equations for colour charges, and the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations for spinning particles, that extends also to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Swift Memory Burden in Merging Black Holes: how information load affects black hole's classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we argue that the information load carried by a black hole affects its classical perturbations. We refer to this phenomenon as the ``swift memory burden effect" and show that it is universal for objects of high efficiency of information storage. The effect is expected to have observable manifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in Einstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although degenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The strength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which measures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the information load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of a black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some master formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as on solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect must be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial black holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments. We also provide a proposal for the test of the memory burden phenomenon in a table-top laboratory setting with cold bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note the finite formulation of quantum field theory, which is based on the system of the differential equations which are reminiscent of Callan-Symanzik equations is discussed. This system of equations was previously formulated on the bare language. We rederive these equations on a fully renormalized language. In this language, it was demonstrated for a simple $\phi^4$ toy model, that with the specific choice of renormalization conditions - on-shell scheme for renormalized mass - the class of such finite renormalization prescriptions is equivalent to the classical renormalization group equation written in Callan-Symanzik-Ovsyannikov form.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Fermions in $AdS_2$ Black Hole: Chirality, Entanglement, and Spectral Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</description>

Abstract: We setup an anisotropic compact star model in presence of Weyl ``trace" anomaly. We derive an exact interior solution which determines the contribution of the vacuum trace anomaly. We introduce a dimentionless parameter, $\beta$, to characterize this contribution. Applying appropriate matching conditions with the exterior solution, we determine the model parameters in terms of the Weyl anomaly parameter $\beta$ and the compactness parameter, $C=\frac{2GM}{c^2 \mathcal{R}}$ where $M$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are the mass and the radius of the star. We investigate the parameter space $\{\beta, C\}$ and the corresponding modifications of Buchdahl limit on the maximum compactness. We use astrophysical observations of mass and radius of the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 to constrain the Weyl anomaly parameter $\beta$. Also, we investigate the Mass-Radius diagram with other observational constraints from NICER and LIGO/Virgo collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal states are thermal with respect to a fixed Hamiltonian. How much information about this Hamiltonian can we ``bootstrap'' from the subsystems of a thermal state? We attack the problem by positioning it as a subspecies of the quantum marginal problem. In states that obey the quantum Markov property, the Petz recovery map captures the knowledge of the larger system inherent in a subsystem. We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction breaks down at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his The Road to Reality as well as in his Fashion, Faith and Fantasy, Roger Penrose criticises string theory and its practitioners from a variety of angles ranging from conceptual, technical, and methodological objections to sociological observations about the string theoretic scientific community. In this article, we assess Penrose's conceptual/technical objections to string theory, focussing in particular upon those which invoke the notion of `functional freedom'. In general, we do not find these arguments to be successful.</description>

      <title>Smearing of dynamical quantum phase transitions in dissipative free-fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Lindblad dynamics of the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) in dissipative quadratic fermion systems. Focusing on the case of gain and loss dissipation, we derive general conditions for the persistence of nonanalyticities (so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions) in the time evolution of the RLE. We show that nonanalyticities that are present in the corresponding unitary dynamics can survive under purely gain or purely loss processes, but are completely smeared out as soon as both channels are active, even if one is infinitesimally small. These results hold for generic dissipative Gaussian evolutions, and are illustrated explicitly for the quench from the N\'eel state in the tight-binding chain, as well as for the quantum Ising chain. We also show that the subtle interplay between dissipative and unitary dynamics gives rise to a nested lightcone structure in the dynamics of the RLE, even in cases where this structure is not present in the corresponding unitary evolution, due to coherent cancellations in the phase structure of the wavefunction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, systematic method for the complete symbolic reduction of multi-loop Feynman integrals, leveraging the power of generating functions. The differential equations governing these generating functions naturally yield symbolic recurrence relations. We develop an efficient algorithm that utilizes these recurrences to reduce integrals to a minimal set of master integrals. This approach circumvents the exponential growth of traditional Integration-by-Parts relations, enabling the reduction of high-rank, multi-loop integrals critical for state-of-the-art calculations in perturbative quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of the pion, including the contributions from one dynamical gluon, using the basis light-front quantization (BLFQ) approach. By solving a light-front QCD Hamiltonian with a three-dimensional confining potential, we obtain the light-front wavefunctions (LFWFs) for both the quark-antiquark and quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sectors. These wavefunctions are then employed to compute the unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of valence quarks and gluons. We also extract the transverse spatial distributions, providing the squared radii of quark and gluon densities in the impact-parameter space. This work contributes toward a three-dimensional understanding of the pion's internal structure in both momentum and coordinate space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauging and duality transformations, two of the most useful tools in many-body physics, are shown to be equivalent up to constant depth quantum circuits in the case of one-dimensional quantum lattice models. This is demonstrated by making use of matrix product operators, which provide the lattice representation theory for global (categorical) symmetries as well as a classification of duality transformations. Our construction makes the symmetries of the gauged theory manifest and clarifies how to deal with static background fields when gauging generalised symmetries.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topology of the Early Universe using CMB Temperature and Polarization Anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as measured today, may offer key insights into the topology of the early universe prior to inflation, for example, by discriminating between flat and warped geometries. In this paper, we focus on a Kaluza-Klein model with an extra spatial dimension that compactifies at the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) epoch, subject to mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions at fixed points. As a consequence, a set of infrared cutoffs naturally emerges in both the scalar and tensor spectra, leading to observable consequences in the CMB. We examine in detail the possible signatures of such a topology, particularly in relation to the even-odd parity imbalance already reported by the COBE, WMAP and Planck missions in the temperature angular correlations at large scales. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the existing Planck E-mode polarization data, and to the high-precision B-mode polarization measurements expected from the forthcoming LiteBIRD mission.</description>

Abstract: We study the axial and polar perturbations of slowly rotating Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in General Relativity, applying a perturbative double expansion. In particular, we derive the equations for $l=2$, $M_z=2$ perturbations of these objects which are parametrized by an asymmetry parameter. The equations constitute an astrophysically interesting sector of the perturbations that contribute dominantly to the gravitational wave radiation. Moreover, calculation of these modes may exhibit potential instabilities in the quadrupole sector.</description>

      <title>Double Wick rotations between symmetries of Taub-NUT, near-horizon extreme Kerr, and swirling spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly show that certain 4-dimensional infinitesimal group actions with 3-dimensional orbits are related by double Wick rotations. In particular, starting with the symmetries of the spherical/hyperbolic/planar Taub-NUT spacetimes, one can obtain symmetries of the near-horizon extreme Kerr (NHEK) geometry or swirling universe by complex analytic continuations of coordinates. Similarly, the static spherical/hyperbolic/planar symmetries (i.e., symmetries of the Schwarzschild spacetime and other A-metrics) are mapped to symmetries of the B-metrics (or Melvin spacetime). All these mappings are theory-independent -- they constitute relations among symmetries themselves, and, hence among the classes of symmetry-invariant metrics and electromagnetic field strengths, rather than among specific solutions. Consequently, finding, e.g., vacuum Taub-NUT-type solutions in a given gravitational theory automatically yields vacuum NHEK- or swirling-type solutions of that theory, with a possible extension to the electromagnetic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmonizing classical and quantum worlds is a major challenge for modern physics. A significant portion of the scientific community supports the notion that classical mechanics is an effective theory that arises from quantum mechanics. Recently, the present authors have argued that this should not be the case, as quantum mechanics is not trustworthy for describing the center of mass of systems with masses $m$ much larger than the Planck mass $M_\text{P}$. In this vein, a simple gravitational self-decoherence model was proposed, describing how the center of mass of quantum systems would classicalize for $m \sim M_\text{P}$. Here, we show that our model does not prevent macroscopic systems (with classical centers of mass) from harboring quantum internal vibrations (as has been observed in the laboratory).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>

Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>

Abstract: We reformulate the lifting problem in the D1-D5 CFT as a supercharge cohomology problem, and enumerate BPS states according to the fortuitous/monotone classification. Focusing on the deformed $T^4$ symmetric orbifold theory, cohomology classes in the $N=2$ theory are explicitly constructed and matched with the exact BPS partition function. For general $N$, an infinite set of monotone cohomology classes are characterized and conjectured to be exhaustive. We further describe how to assemble BPS states at smaller $N$ into BPS states at larger $N$, and interpret their holographic duals as black hole bound states and massive stringy excitations on smooth horizonless (e.g. Lunin-Mathur) geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Bringing two semi-infinite heat baths at different temperatures into thermal contact along a surface, the NESS arises at asymptotically late times as a stationary state that has modewise thermal properties and features a heat flow between the reservoirs. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the transition rate with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not couple to the heat flow, causing the detector to only register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>

Abstract: We consider wave packets of a massless scalar field that have well-localized Rindler energy, and examine how their energy appears to a Minkowski observer to study how the classical gravitational red-shift formula is modified quantum mechanically. We derive, by using the saddle point approximation, an analytic expression for the Minkowski momentum distribution of such Rindler wave packets. We find a universal lower bound on the uncertainty in the Minkowski momentum; the momentum distribution can never become arbitrarily sharp.</description>

      <title>A holographic connection between strings and causal diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore ideas of holography and strings living in the $d+1$ dimensional Anti-de Sitter space $AdS_{d+1}$ in a unified framework borrowed from twistor theory. In our treatise of correspondences between geometric structures of the bulk $AdS_{d+1}$, its boundary and the moduli space of boundary causal diamonds aka the kinematic space ${\mathbb K}$, we adopt a perspective offered by projective geometry. From this viewpoint certain lines in the $d+1$ dimensional real projective space, defined by two light-like vectors in ${\mathbb R}^{d,2}$ play an important role. In these projective geometric elaborations objects like Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces, spacelike geodesics with horospheres providing regularizators for them and the metric on ${\mathbb K}$ all find a natural place. Then we establish a correspondence between classical strings in $AdS_{d+1}$ and causal diamonds of its asymptotic boundary. At each point on the worldsheet, the tangent vectors $\partial_\pm X$ are projected onto boundary coordinates that identify the past and future tips of a causal diamond. Under this projection, the string equations of motion translate into a dynamics of boundary causal diamonds. A procedure for lifting up a causal diamond to get a proper string world sheet is also developed. In this context we identify an emerging $SO(1,1)\times SO(1,d-1)$ gauge structure incorporated into a Grassmannian $\sigma$-model targeted in ${\mathbb K}$. The $d=2$ case is worked out in detail. Surprisingly in this case $AdS_3$ with its strings seems to be a natural object which is living inside projective twistor space. On the other hand ${\mathbb K}$ (comprising two copies of two dimensional de Sitter spaces) is a one which is living inside the Klein quadric, as a real section of a complexified space time.</description>

      <title>A Proposal for symTFTs and symThs from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an embedding of the symTFT construction in (finite cut-off) holography. The proposal passes several non-trivial consistency checks reproducing the expected symTFTs in various cases, including the recently discussed symTFT for the 1-form symmetry of 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Moreover, we comment on the possibility of unifying the symTFT and the symTh descriptions via the democratic formulation of Supergravity, using the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory as an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bootstrap method has proven useful for a wide range of matrix models. Here, we show that the computed momenta can be used to reconstruct the underlying eigenvalue probability distribution, which in turn allows us to compute the free energy of the model, a necessary quantity for identifying the thermodynamically preferred solution. We verify the method on the well-studied quartic potential model and then apply it to a recently analysed asymmetric multi-trace model. We consider an extended class of possible solutions and demonstrate that free-energy analysis reliably selects the correct one, making it an essential tool for studying models with a complex solution structure.</description>

      <title>On the Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field with Magnetic Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a covariant framework for the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of magnetic monopoles. Building on the two-potential formalism of Cabibbo and Ferrari, which treats electric and magnetic sources on equal footing and reveals a $U(1) \times U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we extend the theory into the quantum domain. Using the Gupta-Bleuler procedure in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge, we construct the physical Hilbert space and eliminate negative-norm states. The resulting theory predicts, in addition to conventional photons, the existence of dual photons associated with magnetic charges. We discuss the role of these dual excitations and their possible relevance in the broader context of electromagnetic duality and gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopole Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a variety of bound states of Dirac magnetic monopoles in product $U(1)$ gauge theories that make up a Dirac magnetic monopole with unit magnetic charge under the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group. The size of the bound states is determined by the balance between the repulsive magnetic Coulomb force of the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group and the attractive force from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes of the broken $U(1)$ gauge groups. These bound states are extensions of the configuration first studied in arXiv:1608.06951. We dub this type of configurations ``Magnetic Monopole Molecules'' (MMMs). Besides some illustrative examples of MMMs made of a small number of constituent Dirac magnetic monopoles, a method to combine smaller MMMs to construct larger MMMs is presented. Implications for the weak gravity conjecture are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Crosscap states and duality of Ising field theory in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two distinct crosscap states for the two-dimensional (2D) Ising field theory. These two crosscap states, identifying Ising spins or dual spins (domain walls) at antipodal points, are shown to be related via the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. We derive their Majorana free field representations and extend bosonization techniques to calculate correlation functions of the 2D Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with different crosscap boundaries. Away from criticality, we develop a conformal perturbation theory to calculate the Klein bottle entropy (norm-square of the crosscap overlap) as a universal scaling function [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 151602 (2023)]. For the Ising field theory, our analytical results support the conjectured monotonicity of the Klein bottle entropy under relevant perturbations. The formalism provides a general framework for studying perturbed 2D CFTs on non-orientable manifolds.</description>

      <title>Duality, asymptotic charges and higher form symmetries in $p$-form gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface charges associated to $p$-form gauge fields in arbitrary spacetime dimension for large values of the radial coordinate are computed. We show that, under the Hodge duality between the field strength of the dual formulations, electric-like charges for $p$-forms are mapped to magnetic-like charges for the dual $q$-forms, with $q = D-p-2$. We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for the duality map linking asymptotic electric-like charges of the dual descriptions and we give it an algebraic topology interpretation. As a result the duality map has a topological nature and ensures the charge of a description has information of the dual description leading to a deeper understanding of gauge theories, of the non-trivial charges associated to them and of the duality of their observables. Moreover a link between higher form symmetry charges, naturally associated to a $p$-form gauge theory, and their asymptotic charges is proposed. The higher form charges are reproduced choosing the gauge parameter to be constant and to have support only on an appropriate codimension submanifold. This could partially answer to an open question of the celestial holography program.</description>

      <title>Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognised earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. With these mean values of the potential parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and varying $N_{pivot}$ between $40$ to $55$, we also find that the $r-n_s$ predictions of our model lie well within the $1\sigma$ bounds of joint constraints from combined analysis of ACT, Planck-2018, BICEP and BAO observations. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

Abstract: We present a general formula for the amplitude of forward exclusive hadronic processes in the semihard regime of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), by means of the {\em next-to-leading order} eigenfunctions of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) kernel, as constructed by Chirilli and Kovchegov. We discuss some formal subtleties in the check of compatibility with the similar formula based on the use of the {\em leading-order} BFKL eigenfunctions. Finally, in the specific case of the electroproduction of two light vector mesons, we consider the numerical stability of the amplitude when one or the other set of eigenfunctions is adopted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a correspondence between the quantized constrained 3BF theory and the quantized Einstein-Cartan theory with contact spin-spin interaction, both of which describe the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravitational field. First we introduce the expectation values of observables using the path integral formalism for both theories, and then by integrating out some configuration space variables in the quantum 3BF theory we obtain the definition of the corresponding observable in the quantum Einstein-Cartan theory with contact interaction. The correspondence is a rather general result, since it can be established without actually performing the detailed quantization of either theory. Finally, we discuss the differences in the predictions of the two theories on the example of the 4-volume density of spacetime, and on the example of gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a (2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in the electronic states of an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes. The spin exhibits a variety of dynamical behaviours due to its coupling with the fluctuating geometry, with decoherence emerging as a key signature of this interaction. Our proposal introduces a novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity and matter that can be probed with current technology.</description>

      <title>Correlators in phase-ordering from Schr\"odinger-invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered phase with $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance and we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from the Schr\"odinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$ which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.</description>

Abstract: Exact single-time and two-time correlations and the two-time response function are found for the order-parameter in the voter model with nearest-neighbour interactions. Their explicit dynamical scaling functions are shown to be continuous functions of the space dimension $d&gt;0$. Their form reproduces the predictions of non-equilibrium representations of the Schr\"odinger algebra for models with dynamical exponent ${z}=2$ and with the dominant noise-source coming from the heat bath. Hence the ageing in the voter model is a paradigm for relaxations in non-equilibrium critical dynamics, without detailed balance, and with the upper critical dimension $d^*=2$.</description>

      <title>Dirac Oscillator for Spin-1/2 Particles in a Spinning Cosmic String Spacetime with Spacelike Disclination and Dislocation</title>

Abstract: We study the Dirac oscillator for spin-1/2 particles in a spacetime containing a spinning cosmic string endowed with both curvature (disclination) and torsion (screw dislocation). The background geometry includes off-diagonal and is analyzed through a local tetrad formalism. Working in cylindrical coordinates, we derive the covariant Dirac equation and solve it exactly via a second-order differential equation for the lower spinor component. Three distinct physical configurations are examined: (i) balanced torsion where temporal and spatial contributions are equal, (ii) purely temporal torsion (spinning string), and (iii) purely spatial torsion (screw dislocation). In all cases, we obtain exact energy spectra expressed in terms of effective angular quantum numbers that depend on the oscillator frequency, the angular deficit parameter \alpha , the torsional parameters J_{t} and J_{z}, and the longitudinal momentum k. The resulting energy levels generalize the flat-spacetime Moshinsky oscillator spectrum by incorporating energy- and momentum-dependent shifts due to the background geometry. We show that curvature and torsion lift degeneracies and induce nontrivial modifications to the angular structure of the solutions. The flat-space spectrum is recovered as a special limit when both curvature and torsion vanish. This work provides a fully solvable model that illustrates how spacetime defects affect relativistic quantum systems, offering insights relevant to both high-energy physics and condensed-matter analogs.</description>

      <title>Complex Lies, Real Physics: The Role of Algebra Complexification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In physics, Lie groups represent the algebraic structure that describes symmetry transformations of a given system. Then, the descending Lie algebra of those groups are necessary real. In most cases, the complexification of those Lie algebra is necessary in order to derive irreductible representations of the Lie algebra and subsequently of the symmetry group. In this paper, we give a precise definition of the concept and prove step by step an important result $$\left(\mathfrak{g}^\mathbb{R}\right)_\mathbb{C} \simeq \mathfrak{g} \times \bar{\mathfrak{g}}. $$ This result is used to determine the irreductible representations of the proper Lorentz group and thus the physical objects admissible when this symmetry is present. It is shown that finite representations of the proper Lorentz group are characterized by pairs of half-integers $(j_1,j_2)$, which determine unambiguously the physical object associated to the given representation. For example, the representation $(0,0)$ of dimension $1$ is called the scalar representation, it corresponds to the Higgs field, and $(\frac{1}{2},0) \oplus (0,\frac{1}{2})$ of dimension $4$ is called the Dirac spinor representation, it corresponds to matter particle called fermions. This means that the mathematical group structure determines the material content of the universe following this algebraic structure.</description>
