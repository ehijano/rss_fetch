      <title>Borrowing on Belief? Consumer Confidence and U.S. Credit -- A VECM Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the interdependent relationship between consumer credit and consumer confidence in the United States using monthly data from January 1978 to August 2024. Utilizing a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), the analysis focuses on the interplay between household borrowing behaviour and consumer sentiment while controlling for macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, unemployment, and money supply. The results reveal a stable long-run equilibrium: heightened consumer confidence is associated with increased credit utilization, reflecting greater financial optimism among households. In the short run, shifts in consumer confidence exert relatively modest immediate influence on credit usage, whereas consumer credit adjusts slowly, displaying significant inertia. Impulse-response analysis confirms that shocks to consumer confidence generate sustained positive effects on borrowing, while unexpected increases in credit initially depress sentiment but only fleetingly. These findings underscore the critical role of the relationship between consumer confidence and credit-market dynamics and highlight its policy relevance for fostering balanced and stable household finances.</description>

      <title>Beyond Leaders and Laggards: A Typology of Renewable Energy Adoption Trajectories with Evidence from Off-Grid Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of renewable energy adoption is essential for designing strategies that accelerate its spread - an urgent priority for advancing climate goals and improving well-being, especially in off-grid regions facing energy poverty. This study introduces a time-series-based analytical framework that quantifies and classifies adoption behaviors of geographic entities within a region. A novel metric, the Adoption over Time Index (ATI), captures cumulative adoption intensity and identifies shifts in adoption trends, improving the ability to distinguish between fundamental adoption paths. By combining ATI with three key features found to be indicative of adoption dynamics, we define a typology of eight distinct paths, including two newly identified trajectories - the decelerating path and the declining moderate path. Applying this framework to a case study of an off-grid Bedouin population in southern Israel reveals that these retreating paths exist in substantial proportions. Identifying such trends is critical for addressing stagnation and preventing backsliding in the diffusion process. The leaping path, by contrast, was nearly absent. We also identify behavioral diversity within both front-runner and trailing groups. Differentiating among these groups can help tailor acceleration strategies. The analysis further reveals significant disparities in adoption levels across the region, with lagging clusters being widespread and overall adoption falling short of the region's potential.</description>

      <title>A mix of long-duration hydrogen and thermal storage enables large-scale electrified heating in a renewable European energy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based long-duration electricity storage (LDES) is a key component of renewable energy systems to deal with seasonality and prolonged periods of low wind and solar energy availability. In this paper, we investigate how electrified heating with heat pumps impacts LDES requirements in a fully renewable European energy system, and which role thermal storage can play. Using a large weather dataset of 78 weather years, we find that electrified heating significantly increases LDES needs, as optimal average energy capacities more than quadruple across all weather years compared to a scenario without electrified heating. We attribute 75% of this increase to a leverage effect, as additional electric load amplifies storage needs during times of low renewable availability. The remaining 25% are the result of a compound effect, where exceptional cold spells coincide with periods of renewable scarcity. Furthermore, heat pumps increase the variance in optimal storage capacities between weather years substantially because of demand-side weather variability. Long-duration thermal storage attached to district heating networks can reduce LDES needs by on average 36%. To support and safeguard wide-spread heating electrification, policymakers should expedite the creation of adequate regulatory frameworks for both long-duration storage types to de-risk investments in light of high weather variability.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Barriers to Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the idea that lack of experience is a source of errors but that experience should reduce them, we model agents' behavior using a stochastic choice model (logit quantal response), leaving endogenous the accuracy of their choices. In some games, higher accuracy leads to unstable logit-response dynamics. Starting from the lowest possible accuracy, we define the barrier to learning as the maximum accuracy which keeps the logit-response dynamic stable (for all lower accuracies). This defines a limit quantal response equilibrium. We apply the concept to centipede, travelers' dilemma, and 11-20 money-request games and to first-price and all-pay auctions, and discuss the role of strategy restrictions in reducing or amplifying barriers to learning.</description>

      <title>Estimating Export-productivity Cutoff Contours with Profit Data: A Novel Threshold Estimation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel method to estimate firm-specific market-entry thresholds in international economics, allowing fixed costs to vary across firms alongside productivity. Our framework models market entry as an interaction between productivity and observable fixed-cost measures, extending traditional single-threshold models to ones with set-valued thresholds. Applying this approach to Chinese firm data, we estimate export-market entry thresholds as functions of domestic sales and surrogate variables for fixed costs. The results reveal substantial heterogeneity and threshold contours, challenging conventional single-threshold-point assumptions. These findings offer new insights into firm behavior and provide a foundation for further theoretical and empirical advancements in trade research.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Machine Penalty with Imperfectly Fair AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid technological progress, effective human-machine cooperation remains a significant challenge. Humans tend to cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a phenomenon known as the machine penalty. Here, we show that artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models can overcome this penalty in social dilemma games with communication. In a pre-registered experiment with 1,152 participants, we deploy AI agents exhibiting three distinct personas: selfish, cooperative, and fair. However, only fair agents elicit human cooperation at rates comparable to human-human interactions. Analysis reveals that fair agents, similar to human participants, occasionally break pre-game cooperation promises, but nonetheless effectively establish cooperation as a social norm. These results challenge the conventional wisdom of machines as altruistic assistants or rational actors. Instead, our study highlights the importance of AI agents reflecting the nuanced complexity of human social behaviors -- imperfect yet driven by deeper social cognitive processes.</description>
