      <title>Slip Due to Kink Propagation at the Liquid-Solid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Couette flow, the liquid atoms adjacent to a solid substrate may have a finite average tangential velocity relative to the substrate. This so-called slip has been frequently observed. However, the particular molecular-level mechanisms that give rise to liquid slip are poorly understood. It is often assumed that liquid slip occurs by surface diffusion whereby atoms independently move from one substrate equilibrium site to another. We show that under certain conditions, liquid slip is due not to singular independent molecular motion, but to localized nonlinear waves that propagate at speeds that are orders of magnitude greater than the slip velocity at the liquid-solid interface. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we find the properties of these waves and the conditions under which they are to be expected as the main progenitors of slip. We also provide a theoretical guide to the properties of these nonlinear waves by using an augmented Frenkel-Kontorova model. The new understanding provided by our results may lead to enhanced capabilities of the liquid-solid interface, for heat transfer, mixing, and surface-mediated catalysis.</description>

      <title>Colloidoscope: Detecting Dense Colloids in 3d with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidoscope is a deep learning pipeline employing a 3D residual Unet architecture, designed to enhance the tracking of dense colloidal suspensions through confocal microscopy. This methodology uses a simulated training dataset that reflects a wide array of real-world imaging conditions, specifically targeting high colloid volume fraction and low-contrast scenarios where traditional detection methods struggle. Central to our approach is the use of experimental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and point-spread-functions (PSFs) to accurately quantify and simulate the experimental data. Our findings reveal that Colloidoscope achieves superior recall in particle detection (finds more particles) compared to conventional heuristic methods. Simultaneously, high precision is maintained (high fraction of true positives.) The model demonstrates a notable robustness to photobleached samples, thereby prolonging the imaging time and number of frames than may be acquired. Furthermore, Colloidoscope maintains small scale resolution sufficient to classify local structural motifs. Evaluated across both simulated and experimental datasets, Colloidoscope brings the advancements in computer vision offered by deep learning to particle tracking at high volume fractions. We offer a promising tool for researchers in the soft matter community, this model is deployed and available to use pretrained: https://github.com/wahabk/colloidoscope.</description>

      <title>A geometric condition for robot-swarm cohesion and cluster-flock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. Active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic signed-parameter with units of curvature, which we term curvity, derivable from first principles. Robot experiments and numerical simulations show that the properties of the individual robot alone -- radius and curvity -- control pair-cohesion in a binary system as well as the stability of flocking and clustering in a swarm. Our results have applications in meta-materials and embodied decentralized control.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional squishy glass: yielding under oscillatory shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yielding response to an imposed oscillatory shear is investigated for a model two-dimensional dense glass composed of bidisperse, deformable polymer rings, with the ring stiffness being the control parameter. In the quiescent glassy state, the more flexible rings exhibit a broader spectrum of shape fluctuations, which becomes increasingly constrained with increasing ring stiffness. Under shear, the highly packed rings yield, i.e. the thermal assembly looses rigidity, with the threshold yield strain increasing significantly with decreasing ring stiffness. Further, the rings display significant deviations in their shape compared to their unsheared counterparts. This study provides insights into the interplay between shape changes and translational rearrangements under shear, thus contributing to the understanding of yielding transition in densely packed, deformable polymer systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative self-assembly of patchy particles under nonequilibrium drive: a computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by biology and implemented using nanotechnology, the self-assembly of patchy particles has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for constructing complex structures that mimic natural systems with diverse functionalities. Here, we explore the dissipative self-assembly of patchy particles under nonequilibrium conditions, with the aim of overcoming the constraints imposed by equilibrium assembly. Utilizing extensive Monte Carlo (MC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we provide insight into the effects of external forces that mirror natural and chemical processes on the assembly rates and the stability of the resulting assemblies comprising $8$, $10$, and $13$ patchy particles. Implemented by a favorable bond-promoting drive in MC or a pulsed square wave potential in MD, our simulations reveal the role these external drives play in accelerating assembly kinetics and enhancing structural stability, evidenced by a decrease in the time to first assembly and an increase in the duration the system remains in an assembled state. Through the analysis of an order parameter, entropy production, bond dynamics, and interparticle forces, we unravel the underlying mechanisms driving these advancements. We also validated our key findings by simulating a larger system of $100$ patchy particles. Our comprehensive results not only shed light on the impact of external stimuli on self-assembly processes but also open a promising pathway for expanding the application by leveraging patchy particles for novel nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Light-Activated Motion, Geometry- and Confinement-Induced Optical Effects of 2D Platelets in a Nematic Liquid Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motile liquid crystal (LC) colloids show peculiar behavior due to the high sensitivity to external stimuli driven by the LC elastic and surface effects. However, few studies focus on harnessing the LC phase transitions to propel colloidal inclusions by the nematic-isotropic (NI) interface. We engineer a quasi-2D active system consisting of solid micron-sized light-absorbent platelets immersed in a thermotropic nematic LC. The platelets self-propel in the presence of light while self-inducing a localized NI phase transition. The sample's temperature, light intensity, and confinement determine three different regimes: a 2D large regime where the platelet-isotropic phase bubble is static and the NI interface remains stable; a compact motile-2D regime where the NI interface lies closer to the platelet's contour; and a motile-3D-confinement regime characterized by the emergence of multipolar configurations of the LC. We perform continuum-theory simulations that predict stationary platelet-LC states when confined in 3D. Our study in an intrinsically far-from-equilibrium landscape is crucial for designing simple synthetic systems that contribute to our understanding of harnessing liquid crystals' phase transitions to propel colloidal inclusions and trigger tunable topological reconfigurations leading to photonic responses.</description>

      <title>Boundary accumulations of active rods in microchannels with elliptical cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many motile microorganisms and bio-mimetic micro-particles have been successfully modeled as active rods - elongated bodies capable of self-propulsion. A hallmark of active rod dynamics under confinement is their tendency to accumulate at the walls. Unlike passive particles, which typically sediment and cease their motion at the wall, accumulated active rods continue to move along the wall, reorient, and may even escape from it. The dynamics of active rods at the wall and those away from it result in complex and non-trivial distributions. In this work, we examine the effects of wall curvature on active rod distribution by studying elliptical perturbations of tube-like microchannels, that is, the cylindrical confinement with a circular cross-section, common in both nature and various applications. By developing a computational model for individual active rods and conducting Monte Carlo simulations, we discovered that active rods tend to concentrate at locations with the highest wall curvature. We then investigated how the distribution of active rod accumulation depends on the background flow and orientation diffusion. Finally, we used a simplified mathematical model to explain why active rods preferentially accumulate at high-curvature locations.</description>

      <title>Testing Adam-Gibbs relationship in tapped Granular Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered granular packings share many similarities with supercooled liquids, particu-larly in the rapid increase of structural relaxation time within a narrow range of temperature or packing fraction. However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of granular materials align with those of their corresponding thermal hard sphere liquids, and the particular influence of friction of a granular system remains largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally study the slow relaxation and the steady state of monodisperse granular sphere packings with X-ray tomography. We first quantify the thermodynamic parameters under the Edwards' ensemble, (i.e., effective temperature and configurational entropy), of granular spheres with varying friction, and measure their characteristic relaxation time during compaction processes. We then demonstrate a unified picture of the relaxation process in granular systems in which the Adam-Gibbs (AG) relationship is generally followed. These results clarify the close relation-ship between granular materials and the ideal frictionless hard sphere model.</description>

      <title>Designing precise dynamical steady states in disordered networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic structures can be designed to exhibit precise, complex, and exotic functions. While recent work has focused on the quasistatic limit governed by force balance, the mechanics at a finite driving rate are governed by Newton's equations. The goal of this work is to study the feasibility, constraints, and implications of creating disordered structures with exotic properties in the dynamic regime. The dynamical regime offers responses that cannot be realized in quasistatics, such as responses at an arbitrary phase, frequency-selective responses, and history-dependent responses. We employ backpropagation through time and gradient descent to design spatially specific steady states in disordered spring networks. We find that a broad range of steady states can be achieved with small alterations to the structure, operating both at small and large amplitudes. We study the effect of varying the damping, which interpolates between the underdamped and the overdamped regime, as well as the amplitude, frequency, and phase. We show that convergence depends on several competing effects, including chaos, large relaxation times, a gradient bias due to finite time simulations, and strong attenuation. By studying the eigenmodes of the linearized system, we show that the systems adapt very specifically to the task they were trained to perform. Our work demonstrates that within physical bounds, a broad array of exotic behaviors in the dynamic regime can be obtained, allowing for a richer range of possible applications.</description>

      <title>Solvent isotopic effect on the phase transition of lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals: Heavy water makes mesogens less charged</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay among solute and solvent molecules in lyotropic mesophases governs their physicochemical properties, such as phase behaviors and viscoelasticity. In our model system, a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (LCLC) made by disodium cromoglycate (DSCG), charged plank-like molecules self-assemble to form elongated aggregates via non-covalent attractions in water (H$_{2}$O). The aggregates align to exhibit liquid crystalline phases: nematic and columnar phases. Here, we report the isotopic effect on the phase behavior of the LCLC when D$_2$O is substituted for H$_2$O. D$_2$O-DSCG exhibits higher nematic-to-isotropic phase transition temperatures than H$_2$O-DSCG. X-ray scattering reveals considerably longer inter-aggregate correlation lengths in D$_2$O-LCLCs. In contrast, the other microstructural properties, such as inter-aggregate distances and intra-aggregate correlation lengths, remain almost the same. Our $^{23}$Na FT-NMR measurement reveals that D$_2$O-DSCG aggregates are less charged with more counter-ions, Na$^+$, bound to them than H$_2$O-DSCG aggregates. Weaker electrostatic repulsion between aggregates may stabilize the nematic phase, and this solvent isotopic effect may generally apply to diverse aqueous lyotropic mesophases with electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>Ordering, spontaneous flows and aging in active fluids depositing tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing experimental evidence shows that cell monolayers can induce long-lived perturbations to their environment, akin to footprints, which in turn influence the global dynamics of the system. Inspired by these observations, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework to describe systems where an active field dynamically interacts with a non-advected footprint field, deposited by the active field. We derive the corresponding general hydrodynamics for both polar and nematic fields. Our findings reveal that the dynamic coupling to a footprint field induces remarkable effects absent in classical active hydrodynamics, such as symmetry-dependent modifications to the isotropic-ordered transition, which may manifest as either second-order or first-order, alterations in spontaneous flow transitions, potentially resulting in oscillating flows and rotating fields, and initial condition-dependent aging dynamics characterized by long-lived transient states. Our results suggest that footprint deposition could be a key mechanism determining the dynamical phases of cellular systems, or more generally active systems inducing long-lived perturbations to their environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flocking phase transitions found in models of polar active matter are paradigmatic examples of active phase transitions in soft matter. An interesting specialization of flocking models concerns a ``topological'' vs ``metric'' choice by which agents are considered to be interacting neighbors. While recent theoretical work suggests that the order-disorder transition in these polar aligning models is universally first order, numerical studies have suggested that topological models may instead have a continuous transition. Some recent simulations have found that some variations of topologically interacting flocking agents have a discontinuous transition, but unambiguous observations of phase coexistence using common Voronoi-based alignment remains elusive. In this work, we use a custom GPU-accelerated simulation package to perform million-particle-scale simulations of these Voronoi-Vicsek flocking models. By accessing such large systems on appropriately long time scales, we are able to show that a regime of stable phase coexistence between the ordered and disordered phases, confirming the discontinuous nature of this transition in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Protocol dependence for avalanches under constant stress in elastoplastic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close to the yielding transition, amorphous solids exhibit a jerky dynamics characterized by plastic avalanches. The statistics of these avalanches have been measured experimentally and numerically using a variety of different triggering protocols, assuming that all of them were equivalent for this purpose. In particular two main classes of protocols have been studied, deformation under controlled strain or under controlled stress. In this work, we investigate different protocols to generate plasticity avalanches and conduct twodimensional simulations of an elastoplastic model to examine the protocol dependence of avalanche statistics in yield-stress fluids. We demonstrate that when stress is controlled, the value and even the existence of the exponent governing the probability distribution function of avalanche sizes strongly depend on the protocol chosen to initiate avalanches. This confirms in finite dimensions a scenario presented in a previous mean-field analysis. We identify a consistent stress-controlled protocol whose associated avalanches differ from the quasi-static ones in their fractal dimension and dynamical exponent. Remarkably, this protocol also seems to verify the scaling relations among exponents previously proposed. Our results underscores the necessity for a cautious interpretation of avalanche universality within elastoplastic models, and more generally within systems where several control parameters exist.</description>

      <title>Systematic Coarse-Graining of Sequence-Dependent Structure and Elasticity of Double-Stranded DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained models have played an important role in the study of the behavior of DNA at length scales beyond a few hundred base pairs. Traditionally, these models have relied on structurally featureless and sequence-independent approaches, such as the twistable worm-like chain. However, research over the past decade has illuminated the substantial impact of DNA sequence even at the kilo-base pair scale. Several robust sequence-dependent models have emerged, capturing intricacies at the base pair-step level. Here we introduce an analytical framework for coarse-graining such models to the 2 to 40-base pair scale while preserving essential structural and dynamical features. These faithful coarse-grained parametrizations enable efficient sampling of large molecules. Rather than providing a fully parametrized model, we present the methodology and software necessary for mapping any base pair-step model to the desired level of coarse-graining. Finally, we provide application examples of our method, including estimates of the persistence length and effective torsional stiffness of DNA in a setup mimicking a freely orbiting tweezer, as well as simulations of intrinsically helical DNA.</description>

      <title>Interaction between corner and bulk flows during drainage in granular porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05574</link>

Abstract: Drainage in porous media can be broken down into two main mechanisms: a primary piston-like displacement of the interfaces through the bulk of pore bodies and throats, and a secondary slow flow through corners and films in the wake of the invasion front. In granular porous media, this secondary drainage mechanism unfolds in connected pathways of pendular structures, such as capillary bridges and liquid rings, formed between liquid clusters. To represent both mechanisms, we proposed a dynamic dual-network model for drainage, considering that a gas displaces a wetting liquid from quasi-2D granular porous media. For this model, dedicated analyses of the capillary bridge shapes and hydraulic conductivity were conducted so that the secondary drainage mechanism could be properly quantified at finite speeds. With the model, an investigation of the wetting-phase connectivity and flow during drainage was carried out, covering a broad range of flow conditions. Results indicate that the span of liquid-connected structures in the unsaturated region, as well as their ability to contribute to flow, varies significantly with Capillary and Bond numbers.</description>

      <title>Transition path time over a barrier of a colloidal particle in a viscoelastic bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the statistics of the transition path time taken by a submicron bead to successfully traverse an energy barrier created by two optical tweezers in two prototypical viscoelastic fluids, namely, aqueous polymer and micellar solutions. We find a very good agreement between our experimental distributions and a theoretical expression derived from the generalized Langevin equation for the particle motion. Our results reveal that the mean transition path time measured in such viscoelastic fluids have a non-trivial dependence on the barrier curvature and they can be significantly reduced when compared with those determined in Newtonian fluids of the same zero-shear viscosity. We verify that the decrease of the mean transition path time can be described in terms of an effective viscosity that quantitatively coincides with that measured by linear microrheology at a frequency determined by the reactive mode that gives rise to the unstable motion over the barrier. Therefore, our results uncover the linear response of the particle during its thermally activated escape from a metastable state even when taking place in a non-Markovian bath.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Origins of Yielding in Hybrid Double Network Hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid double-network hydrogels are a class of material that comprise transiently and permanently crosslinked polymer networks and exhibit an enhanced toughness that is believed to be governed by the yielding of the transient polymer network. The precise role of the two polymer networks in this yielding transition and their interplay remains an open question that we address here through constructing a series of hydrogel designs in which the interaction within and between the two polymer networks are systematically inhibited or enhanced. We characterise each of the hydrogel designs using large amplitude oscillatory shear rheology (LAOS). Inspecting yielding through elastic stress across hydrogel designs, we elucidate that the hybrid double-network hydrogel exhibits a two-step yielding behaviour that originates from to the presence of transient crosslinks. Examining the rheological response within each oscillatory cycle and across the hydrogel designs, we show that the micro-structural changes in the transient network are crucial in the second stage of this yielding. We surmise that the first step of yielding is determined by the intermolecular interactions between the two polymer networks by systematically altering the strength of the interactions. These interactions also influence the second step of yielding, which we show is governed by the transient intermolecular interactions within the polymer networks. Our study therefore reveals that the interactions between the polymer networks are as crucial as within the polymer networks and therefore provides insights into how the yielding mechanisms in soft composite materials can be identified, adjusted, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Stripe and Bubble Ratchets on Asymmetric Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a variety of non-monotonic ratchet effects can arise when mesophase pattern-forming systems, which exhibit anisotropic crystal, stripe, and bubble reigmes, are coupled to one-dimensional asymmetric substrates under ac driving. The ratchet efficiency and direction of motion are determined by how well the mesophase morphology matches the periodicity and shape of the substrate. Stripe states that are aligned with the substrate show the strongest ratchet effect, large bubbles show a weak ratchet effect, and small bubbles show a strong ratchet effect with an efficiency that oscillates as a function of ac drive amplitude. We map out the different rectification phases as a function of the pattern morphology, substrate strength, and ac drive amplitude. The pronounced ratchet effects that we observe in some regimes can be exploited for pattern sorting in hard and soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Air jet impact craters on granular surfaces: a universal scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Craters form as the lander's exhaust interacts with the planetary surfaces. Understanding this phenomenon is imperative to ensure safe landings. We investigate crater morphology, where a turbulent air jet impinges on the granular surfaces. To reveal the fundamental aspect of this phenomenon, systematic experiments are performed with various air jet velocities, nozzle positions, and grain properties. The resultant crater morphology is characterized by an aspect ratio. We find a universal scaling law in which the aspect ratio is scaled by the dimensionless variable consisting of air velocity at the nozzle, speed of sound in air, nozzle diameter, nozzle tip distance from the surface, grain diameter, the density of grains, and density of air. The obtained scaling reveals the crossover of the length scales governing crater aspect ratio, providing a useful guideline for ensuring safe landings. Moreover, we report a novel drop shaped subsurface cratering phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Motion Ordering in Cellular Polar-polar and Polar-nonpolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the difference in motion ordering between cellular systems with and without information transfer to evaluate the effect of the polar--polar interaction through mutual guiding, which enables cells to inform other cells of their moving directions. We compare this interaction with the polar--nonpolar interaction through cell motion triggered by cellular contact, which cannot provide information on the moving directions. We model these interactions on the basis of the cellular Potts model. We calculate the order parameter of the polar direction in the interactions and examine the cell concentration and surface tension conditions of ordering. The results suggest that the polar--polar interaction through mutual guiding efficiently induces the motion ordering in comparison with the polar-nonpolar interaction for contact triggering, except in cases of weak driving. The results also show that the polar--polar interaction efficiently accelerates the collective motion compared with the polar--nonpolar interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.00720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation provides a mean-field theory of electrolyte solutions at interfaces and in confinement, describing how ions reorganize close to charged surfaces to form the so-called electrical double layer (EDL), with numerous applications ranging from colloid science to biology. This formulary focuses on situations of interest for micro and nanofluidics, and gathers important formulas for the PB description of a Z:Z electrolyte solution inside slit and cylindrical channels. Different approximated solutions (thin EDLs, no co-ion, Debye-H\"uckel, and homogeneous/parabolic potential limits) and their range of validity are discussed, together with the full solution for the slit channel. Common boundary conditions are presented, the thermodynamics of the EDL is introduced, and an overview of the application of the PB framework to the description of electrokinetic effects is given. Finally, the limits of the PB framework are briefly discussed, and Python scripts to solve the PB equation numerically are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the link between the geometric environment of particles, the local deformations of the solvent, and the bulk effective viscosity in non-Brownian suspensions. First, we discuss the caging of particles by their neighbors,and especially the caging of small particles by large ones in bidisperse suspensions.We develop a model that attributes an effective volume to particles depending on their environment, and yields the local deformations and effective viscosity. We compare this model to data from the literature, as well as to our own experiments with suspensions of non-Brownian polystyrene beads. Using dissolved polymers and their coil-stretch transition as strain probes, we measure the local deformation of the liquid and the effect of caging thereon. We obtain a linear relationship between the amplified local strain rate and the particle volume fraction, in which the critical volume fraction $\phi_\mathrm{c}$ appears as an effective volume of the particles; this relationship is found valid up into the dense regime.</description>

Abstract: We study the spontaneous configuration transitions of an active semi-flexible polymer between {\it spiral} and {\it non-spiral} states, and show that the configuration dynamics is fully described by a {\it subcritical pitchfork} bifurcation. Exploiting the fact that active polymer barely moves in {\it spiral} states and exhibits net displacements in {\it non-spiral} states, we theoretically prove that the motion of the active polymer is consistent with a {\it run-and-tumble}-like dynamics. Moreover, we find that there exists an {\it optimal} self-propelling {\it force}, at which the probabilities of finding the polymer in the {\it spiral} and {\it non-spiral} state become equal, that maximizes the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviour and self-assembly of semiflexible polymers in poor-solvent solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Langevin dynamics complemented by Wang-Landau Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase behavior of single and multiple semiflexible polymer chains in solution under poor-solvent conditions. In the case of a single chain, we obtain the full phase diagram in the temperature-bending rigidity (stiffness) plane and we provide connections with a classical mean field result on a lattice as well as with past results on the same model. At low bending rigidity and upon cooling, we find a second order coil-globule transition, followed by a subsequent first order globule-crystal transition at lower temperatures. The obtained crystals have the shape of a twisted rod whose length increases with the increase of the stiffness of the chain. Above a critical value of the stiffness, we also find a direct first order globule-crystal transition, with the crystal having the form of a twisted toroid. Close to the triple point, we find a region with isoenergetic structures with frequent switching from rods to toroids, with the toroid eventually becoming the only observed stable phase at higher stiffness. The model is then extended to many thermally equilibrated chains in a box and the analogous phase diagram is deduced where the chains are observed to first fold into a globule bundle at low stiffness upon cooling, and then rearrange into a nematic bundle via a nucleation process involving an isotropic-nematic transition. As in the single chain counterpart, above a critical stiffness the chains are observed to undergo a direct transition from a gas of isotropically distributed chains to a nematic bundle as the temperature decreases in agreement with recent suggestions from mean field theory. The consequences of these findings for self-assembly of biopolymers in solutions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by various recent experimental findings, we propose a dynamical model of intermittently self-propelled particles: active particles that recurrently switch between two modes of motion, namely an active run-state and a turn state, in which self-propulsion is absent. The durations of these motility modes are derived from arbitrary waiting-time distributions. We derive the expressions for exact forms of transport characteristics like mean-square displacements and diffusion coefficients to describe such processes. Furthermore, the conditions for the emergence of sub- and superdiffusion in the long-time limit are presented. We give examples of some important processes that occur as limiting cases of our system, including run-and-tumble motion of bacteria, L\'evy walks, hop-and-trap dynamics, intermittent diffusion and continuous time random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Branched actin networks exert pushing forces in eukaryotic cells, and adapt their stiffness to their environment. The physical basis for their mechanics and adaptability is however not understood. Indeed, here we show that their high density and low connectivity place them outside the scope of standard elastic network models for actin. We combine high-precision mechanical experiments, molecular dynamics simulations and a mean-field elastic theory to show that they are instead dominated by the proliferation of interfilament contacts under compression. This places branched actin in the same category as undercoordinated, fibrous materials such as sheep's wool. When the network is grown under force, filaments entangle as if knitted together and trap contacts in their structure. Trapped contacts play a similar role as crosslinkers in rigidifying the network, and are thus key to its active adaptive mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of bacterial rheotaxis in non-Newtonian fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria often exhibit upstream swimming, which can cause the contamination of biomedical devices and the infection of organs including the urethra or lungs. This process, called rheotaxis, has been studied extensively in Newtonian fluids. However, most microorganisms thrive in non-Newtonian fluids that contain suspended polymers such as mucus and biofilms. Here, we investigate the rheotatic behavior of E. coli near walls in non-Newtonian fluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is enhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning polymeric fluids relative to Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations, revealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow. From this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes experimental rheotatic data in both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids.</description>
