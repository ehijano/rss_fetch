      <title>Enhancing Clinical Data Warehouses with Provenance and Large File Management: The gitOmmix Approach for Clinical Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Clinical data warehouses (CDWs) are essential in the reuse of hospital data in observational studies or predictive modeling. However, state of-the-art CDW systems present two drawbacks. First, they do not support the management of large data files, what is critical in medical genomics, radiology, digital pathology, and other domains where such files are generated. Second, they do not provide provenance management or means to represent longitudinal relationships between patient events. Indeed, a disease diagnosis and its follow-up rely on multiple analyses. In these cases no relationship between the data (e.g., a large file) and its associated analysis and decision can be documented.Method. We introduce gitOmmix, an approach that overcomes these limitations, and illustrate its usefulness in the management of medical omics data. gitOmmix relies on (i) a file versioning system: git, (ii) an extension that handles large files: git-annex, (iii) a provenance knowledge graph: PROV-O, and (iv) an alignment between the git versioning information and the provenance knowledge graph.Results. Capabilities inherited from git and git-annex enable retracing the history of a clinical interpretation back to the patient sample, through supporting data and analyses. In addition, the provenance knowledge graph, aligned with the git versioning information, enables querying and browsing provenance relationships between these elements.Conclusion. gitOmmix adds a provenance layer to CDWs, while scaling to large files and being agnostic of the CDW system. For these reasons, we think that it is a viable and generalizable solution for omics clinical studies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Alzheimer's Disease Prediction: A Novel Approach to Leveraging GAN-Augmented Data for Improved CNN Model Accuracy</title>

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of individuals across the globe. As the prevalence of this disease continues to rise, early diagnosis is crucial to improve clinical outcomes. Neural networks, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are promising tools for diagnosing individuals with Alzheimer's. However, neural networks such as ANNs and CNNs typically yield lower validation accuracies when fed lower quantities of data. Hence, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be utilized to synthesize data to augment these existing MRI datasets, potentially yielding higher validation accuracies. In this study, we use this principle while examining a novel application of the SSMI metric in selecting high-quality synthetic data generated by our GAN to compare its accuracies with shuffled data generated by our GAN. We observed that incorporating GANs with an SSMI metric returned the highest accuracies when compared to a traditional dataset.</description>

      <title>Deep Mapper: Efficient Visualization of Plausible Conformational Pathways</title>

Abstract: Acquiring plausible pathways on high-dimensional structural distributions is beneficial in several domains. For example, in the drug discovery field, a protein conformational pathway, i.e. a highly probable sequence of protein structural changes, is useful to analyze interactions between the protein and the ligands, helping to create new drugs. Recently, a state-of-the-art method in drug discovery was presented, which efficiently computes protein pathways using latent variables obtained from an isometric auto-encoding of the space of 3D density maps associated to protein conformations. However, our preliminary experiments show that there is room to significantly reduce the computing time. In this study, we use the Mapper algorithm, which is a Topological Data Analysis method, and present a novel variant to extract plausible conformational pathways from the isometric latent space with comparatively short running time. The extracted pathways are visualized as paths on the resulting Mapper graph. The methodological novelties are described as follows: firstly, the filter function of the Mapper algorithm is optimized so as to extract the pathways via minimization of an energy loss defined on the Mapper graph itself, while filter functions taken in the classical Mapper algorithm are fixed beforehand. The optimization is with respect to parameters of a deep neural network in the filter. Secondly, the clustering method, which defines the vertices and edges of the Mapper graph, of our algorithm, is designed by incorporating domain prior knowledge to assist the extraction. In our numerical experiments, based on an isometric latent space built on the common 50S-ribosomal dataset, the resulting Mapper graph successfully includes all the well-recognized plausible pathways. Moreover, our running time is much shorter than the above state-of-the-art counterpart.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Characterization of Similarity Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.</description>
