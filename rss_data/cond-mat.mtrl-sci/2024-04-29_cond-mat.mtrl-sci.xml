      <title>Investigating the effect of particle size distribution and complex exchange dynamics on NMR spectra of ions diffusing in disordered porous carbons through a mesoscopic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion adsorption and dynamics in porous carbons is crucial for many technologies such as energy storage and desalination. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key method to investigate such systems thanks to the possibility to distinguish adsorbed (in-pore) and bulk (ex-pore) species in the spectra. However, the large variety of magnetic environments experienced by the ions adsorbed in the particles and the existence of dynamic exchange between the inside of the particles and the bulk renders the intepretation of the NMR experiments very complex. In this work, we optimise and apply a mesoscopic model to simulate NMR spectra of ions in systems where carbon particles of different sizes can be considered. We demonstrate that even for monodisperse systems, complex NMR spectra, with broad and narrow peaks, can be observed. We then show that the inclusion of polydispersity is essential to recover some experimentally observed features, such as the co-existence of peaks assigned to in-pore, exchange and bulk. Indeed, the variety of exchange rates between in-pore and ex-pore environments, present in experiments but not taken into account in analytical models, is necessary to reproduce the complexity of experimental NMR spectra.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast spin dynamics: role of laser-induced modification of exchange parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Induced by an ultra-short laser pulse, the electronic structure of a material undergoes strong modifications leading to a fast demagnetization in magnetic materials. Induced spin-flip transitions are one of the reasons for demagnetization, that is discussed in the literature as a Stoner-like mechanism. On the other hand, demagnetization due to transverse spin fluctuations is usually discussed on the basis of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and hardly accounts for the modification of the electronic structure. In this work we demonstrate a strong impact of the laser-induced electron transitions, both spin-flip and spin-conserving, on the exchange coupling parameters. For this, a simple two-step scheme is suggested. As a first step, the electronic structure time evolution during the ultra-short laser pulse is described accurately within time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. As a next step, the information on the time-dependent electronic structure is used for calculations of the parameters of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. A strong modification of the exchange coupling parameters is found in response to the applied ultra-short laser pulse. The most important reason for this modification is played by the laser induced repopulation of the electronic states. Although the changes of the exchange parameters are most prominent during the laser pulse, they may be important also for the magnetic relaxation. The same concerns the spin-lattice interactions playing a central role for the relaxation process. A strong impact of the laser-induced modification of the electronic structure on the spin-lattice coupling parameters is also shown in this work.</description>

      <title>Towards edge engineering of two-dimensional layered transition-metal dichalcogenides by chemical vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of edge configurations and structures in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for versatile functionalization has attracted intensive interest in recent years. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach has shown promise for TMD edge engineering of atomic edge configurations (1H, 1T or 1T'-zigzag or armchair edges), as well as diverse edge morphologies (1D nanoribbons, 2D dendrites, 3D spirals, etc). These rich-edge TMD layers offer versatile candidates for probing the physical and chemical properties, and exploring new applications in electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing and quantum field. In this review, we present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the manipulation of TMD atomic edges and edge-rich structures using CVD. We highlight the vast range of unique properties associated with these edge configurations and structures and provide insights into the opportunities afforded by such edge-functionalized crystals. The objective of this review is to motivate further research and development efforts in using CVD as a scalable approach to harness the benefits of such crystal-edge engineering.</description>

      <title>Twisted Magnetic Van der Waals Bilayers: An Ideal Platform for Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a universal methodology for generating and manipulating altermagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (MvdW) materials through twisting. We find that a key in-plane 2-fold rotational operation can be achieved in a twisted bilayer of any 2D MvdW material, which takes one of all five 2D Bravais lattices, thereby inducing altermagnetism. By choosing the constituent MvdW monolayer with specific symmetry, our approach can tailor altermagnetism of any type, such as $d$-wave, $g$-wave, and $i$-wave. Furthermore, the properties of our twisted altermagnetic materials can be easily engineered. Taking a transition-metal oxyhalide VOBr as an example, we find that by tuning the twist angle and Fermi level a giant spin Hall angle can be obtained, much larger than the experimentally reported. This approach establishes a general, robust, and adjustable platform to explore altermagnetism, and provides a new efficient way to generate and manipulate the spin current.</description>

      <title>Studies on Topological High-fold Degenerate Semimetal with Chiral Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a type of topological semimetals (TSMs) that can host new fermions with high-fold degeneracy has attracted considerable interest. Among them, ones with chiral structrue particularly catch our attention. Such chiral high-fold degenerate semimetals always have a larger topological charge and longer Fermi arcs which bringing about some special properties. In this work, we found 147 chiral materials with exotic fermions near Fermi level by high-throughput calculation and screening. We selected some typical examples to analyse its topological properties such as topological surface states (TSSs) and Berry curvature. Our results are helpful to provide a promising platform for exploring the physical properties of chiral fermions and application of chiral TSMs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Boson Peaks in Amorphous Phase-Change Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boson peak is a universal phenomenon in amorphous solids. It can be observed as an anomalous contribution to the low-temperature heat capacity over the Debye model. Amorphous phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te are a family of poor glass formers with fast crystallization kinetics, being of interest for phase-change memory applications. So far, whether Boson peaks exist in PCMs is unknown and, if they do, their relevance to PCM properties is unclear. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the pseudo-binary compositions on the tie-line between Ge15Te85 and Ge15Sb85 from a few Kelvins to the liquidus temperatures. Our results demonstrate the evidence of the pronounced Boson peaks in heat capacity below 10 K in the amorphous phase of all compositions. By fitting the data using the Debye model combined with the Einstein model, we can extract the characteristic parameters of the Boson peaks and attribute their origin to the excess vibrational modes of dynamic defects in the amorphous solids. We find that these parameters correlate almost linearly with the Sb-content of the alloys, despite the nonmonotonic behaviors in glass forming abilities. A larger contribution of excess vibrational modes correlates with a larger width of enthalpy relaxation below the glass transition temperature Tg. In a broader context, we show that the correlations of the characteristic parameters of the Boson peaks with Tg and kinetic fragility, vary according to the type of bonding. Specifically, metallic glasses and conventional covalent glasses exhibit distinct patterns of dependence, whereas PCMs manifest characteristics that lie in between. A deeper understanding of the Boson peaks in PCMs holds the promise to enable predictions of material properties at higher temperatures based on features observed in low-temperature heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Recognition of hybrid lead halide perovskites and perovskite-related structures out of X-ray diffraction patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of crystal structures is a crucial stage in the exploration of novel functional materials. This procedure is usually time-consuming and can be false-positive or false-negative. This necessitates a significant level of expert proficiency in the field of crystallography and, especially, requires deep experience in perovskite - related structures of hybrid perovskites. Our work is devoted to the machine learning classification of structure types of hybrid lead halides based on available X-ray diffraction data. Here, we proposed a simple approach to quickly identify of dimensionality of inorganic substructures, types of lead halide polyhedra connectivity and structure types using common powder XRD data and ML - decision tree classification model. The average accuracy of our ML algorithm in predicting the dimensionality of inorganic substructure, type of connection of lead halide and inorganic substructure topology by theoretically calculated XRD pattern among 14 most common structure types reaches 0.86+-0.05, 0.827+-0.028 and 0.71+-0.05, respectively. The validation of our decision tree classification ML model on experimental XRD data shows the accuracies of 1.0 and 0.82 for the dimension and structure type prediction. Thus, our approach can significantly simplify and accelerate the interpretation of highly complicated XRD data for hybrid lead halides.</description>

      <title>An Extendable Cloud-Native Alloy Property Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to rapidly evaluate materials properties through atomistic simulation approaches is the foundation of many new artificial intelligence-based approaches to materials identification and design. This depends on the availability of accurate descriptions of atomic bonding through various forms of interatomic potentials. We present an efficient, robust platform for calculating materials properties, i.e., APEX, the Alloy Property Explorer. APEX enables the rapid evolution of interatomic potential development and optimization, which is of particular importance in fine-tuning new classes of general AI-based foundation models to forms that are readily applicable to impacting materials development. APEX is an open-source, extendable, and cloud-native platform for material property calculations using a range of atomistic simulation methodologies that effectively manages diverse computational resources and is built upon user-friendly features including automatic results visualization, web-based platforms and NoSQL database client. It is designed for expert and non-specialist users, lowers the barrier to entry for interdisciplinary research within the "AI for Materials" framework. We describe the foundation and use of APEX, as well as provide an example of its application to properties of titanium for a wide-range of bonding descriptions.</description>

      <title>Large-scale atomistic study of plasticity in amorphous gallium oxide with a machine-learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to the widely investigated crystalline polymorphs of gallium oxide (Ga2O3), knowledge about its amorphous state is still limited. With the help of a machine-learning interatomic potential, we conducted large-scale atomistic simulations to investigate the glass transition and mechanical behavior of amorphous Ga2O3 (a-Ga2O3). During the quenching simulations, amorphization of gallium oxide melt is observed at ultrahigh cooling rates, including a distinct glass transition. The final densities at room temperature have up to 4% variance compared to experiments. The glass transition temperature is evaluated to range from 1234 K to 1348 K at different cooling rates. Structural analysis of the amorphous structure shows evident similarities in structural properties between a-Ga2O3 and amorphous alumina (a-Al2O3), such as radial distribution function, coordination distribution, and bond angle distribution. An amorphous gallium oxide structure that contains approximately one million atoms is prepared for the tension simulation. A highly plastic behavior is observed at room temperature in the tension simulations, comparable to amorphous alumina. With quantitative characterization methods, we show that a-Ga2O3 can possibly has a higher nucleation rate of localized plastic strain events compared to a-Al2O3, which can increase the material's resistance to shear banding formation during deformation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic domains in ultrathin, bulk-like and proximity-coupled Europium Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of electron spins in materials that are simultaneously ferromagnetic and insulating opens up a wealth of quantum phenomena in spin-based electronics. Thin films of europium oxide (EuO) are ideal for the generation and manipulation of spin-polarized states, but so far there are no experimental literature reports on the magnetic domain patterns for EuO. However, at these microscopic length scales, magnetic relaxation between the remanent and demagnetized states takes place in any spintronic device. This relaxation process involves displacements of magnetic domain walls and can therefore be strongly influenced by the film structure and thickness. Here we present an investigation of the temperature-dependent behavior of magnetic domains and hysteresis in bulk-like (25 nm) and ultrathin (3 nm) EuO films. Magneto-optical Kerr microscopy is used, a technique that is a valuable tool to explore microscopic features such as spin dynamics and magnetic domain walls. Significant Kerr rotation in EuO led to high-contrast magnetic domain images in thick films, facilitating observation of domain dynamics. The critical temperature (TC) and coercivity shows strong thickness-dependent variations. The analysis and comparison of hysteresis loops and domain imaging in EuO and EuO/Co reveal proximity effect-induced antiferromagnetic coupling of both layers. To elucidate the magnetization reversal dynamics in EuO, micromagnetic simulations using MuMax3 were performed below and above TC. This comprehensive approach aims to comprehend the impact of magnetism and magnetic proximity effect in EuO on the micromagnetic scale, potentially extending its magnetic ordering beyond TC.</description>

      <title>From STEM-EDXS data to phase separation and quantification using physics-guided NMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development of a new algorithm which combines state-of-the-art energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy theory and a suitable machine learning formulation for the hyperspectral unmixing of scanning transmission electron microscope EDX spectrum images. The algorithm is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) incorporating a physics-guided factorization model. It optimizes a Poisson likelihood, under additional simplex constraint together with user-chosen sparsity-inducing and smoothing regularizations, and is based on iterative multiplicative updates. The fluorescence of X-rays is fully modeled thanks to state-of-the-art theoretical work. It is shown that the output of the algorithm can be used for a direct chemical quantification. With this approach, it is straightforward to include a priori knowledge on the specimen such as the presence or absence of certain chemical elements in some of its phases. This work is implemented within two open-source Python packages, espm and emtables, which are used here for data simulation, data analysis and quantification. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that incorporating physical modeling in the decomposition helps retrieve meaningful components from spatially and spectrally mixed phases, even when the data are very noisy. For synthetic data with a higher signal, the regularizations yield a tenfold increase in the quality of the reconstructed abundance maps compared to standard NMF. Our approach is further validated on experimental data with a known ground truth, where state-of-the art results are achieved by using prior knowledge about the sample. Our model can be generalized to any other scanning spectroscopy techniques where underlying physical modeling can be linearized.</description>

      <title>Multifold topological semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of topological semimetals with multifold band crossings has opened up a new and exciting frontier in the field of topological physics. These materials exhibit large Chern numbers, leading to long double Fermi arcs on their surfaces, which are protected by either crystal symmetries or topological order. The impact of these multifold crossings extends beyond surface science, as they are not constrained by the Poincar\'e classification of quasiparticles and only need to respect the crystal symmetry of one of the 1651 magnetic space groups. Consequently, we observe the emergence of free fermionic excitations in solid-state systems that have no high-energy counterparts, protected by non-symmorphic symmetries. In this work, we review the recent theoretical and experimental progress made in the field of multifold topological semimetals. We begin with the theoretical prediction of the so-called multifold fermions and discuss the subsequent discoveries of chiral and magnetic topological semimetals. Several experiments that have realized chiral semimetals in spectroscopic measurements are described, and we discuss the future prospects of this field. These exciting developments have the potential to deepen our understanding of the fundamental properties of quantum matter and inspire new technological applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Low-energy nine-layer rhombohedral stacking of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show unique physical, optical, and electronic properties. The known phases of TMDs are 2H and 3R in bulk form, 1T and associated reconstructions, and 1H in monolayer form. This paper reports a hypothetical phase, 9R, that may exist in TMDs (Mo, W)(S, Se, Te)$_2$, meeting both dynamical stability and elastic stability criteria. 9R phase has the same space group as 3R, $i.e.$ rhombohedral $R3m$ without inversion symmetry, and has 9 layers in a conventional unit cell. We find that 9R has an energy within 1 meV per formula unit of 3R and can be energetically favored by a particular strain condition. We further calculate the electronic, elastic, piezoelectric, Raman, and second-harmonic generation signatures of 9R TMDs and compare them with the corresponding 2H and 3R phases. 9R has similar properties to 3R but shows distinctive Raman peaks in the low-frequency regime, improved piezoelectric properties, and unique band splitting arising from layer coupling at the conduction band minimum. These distinct properties make 9R an attractive candidate for applications in piezotronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Polarization textures in crystal supercells with topological bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are a highly tunable platform for studying the momentum space topology of the electronic wavefunctions and real space topology in terms of skyrmions, merons, and vortices of an order parameter. Such textures for electronic polarization can exist in moir\'e heterostructures. A quantum-mechanical definition of local polarization textures in insulating supercells was recently proposed. Here, we propose a definition for local polarization that is also valid for systems with topologically non-trivial bands. We introduce semilocal hybrid polarizations, which are valid even when the Wannier functions in a system cannot be made exponentially localized in all dimensions. We use this definition to explicitly show that nontrivial real-space polarization textures can exist in topologically non-trivial systems with non-zero Chern number under (1) an external superlattice potential, and (2) under a stacking-induced moir\'e potential. In the latter, we find that while the magnitude of the local polarization decreases discontinuously across a topological phase transition from trivial to topologically nontrivial, the polarization does not completely vanish. Our findings suggest that band topology and real-space polar topology may coexist in real materials.</description>

      <title>Rotating spintronic terahertz emitter optimized for microjoule pump-pulse energies and megahertz repetition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) are powerful sources of ultra-broadband single-cycle terahertz (THz) field transients. They work with any pump wavelength, and their polarity and polarization direction are easily adjustable. However, at high pump powers and high repetition rates, STE operation is hampered by a significant increase in the local temperature. Here, we resolve this issue by rotating the STE at a few 100 Hz, thereby distributing the absorbed pump power over a larger area. Our approach permits stable STE operation at a fluence of ~1 mJ/cm$^2$ with up to 18 W pump power at megahertz repetition rates, corresponding to pump-pulse energies of a few 10 $\mu$J and a power density far above the melting threshold of metallic films. The rotating STE is of interest for all ultra-broadband high-power THz applications requiring high repetition rates. As an example, we show that THz pulses with peak fields of 10 kV/cm can be coupled to a THz-lightwave-driven scanning tunneling microscope at 1 MHz repetition rate, demonstrating that the rotating STE can compete with standard THz sources such as LiNbO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Record Acceleration of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model Using High-Performance Wafer Scale Engine</title>

Abstract: The versatility and wide-ranging applicability of the Ising model, originally introduced to study phase transitions in magnetic materials, have made it a cornerstone in statistical physics and a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of emerging computer hardware. Here, we present a novel implementation of the two-dimensional Ising model on a Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), a revolutionary processor that is opening new frontiers in computing. In our deployment of the checkerboard algorithm, we optimized the Ising model to take advantage of the unique WSE architecture. Specifically, we employed a compressed bit representation storing 16 spins on each int16 word, and efficiently distributed the spins over the processing units enabling seamless weak scaling and limiting communications to only immediate neighboring units. Our implementation can handle up to 754 simulations in parallel, achieving an aggregate of over 61.8 trillion flip attempts per second for Ising models with up to 200 million spins. This represents a gain of up to 148 times over previously reported single-device with a highly optimized implementation on NVIDIA V100 and up to 88 times in productivity compared to NVIDIA H100. Our findings highlight the significant potential of the WSE in scientific computing, particularly in the field of materials modeling.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence for the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectra of glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now established that glasses feature low-frequency, nonphononic excitations, in addition to phonons that follow Debye's vibrational density of state (VDoS). Extensive computer studies demonstrated that these nonphononic, glassy excitations follow a universal non-Debye VDoS ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$, at low frequencies $\omega$. Yet, due to intrinsic difficulties in disentangling ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the total VDoS ${\cal D}(\omega)$, which is experimentally accessible through various scattering techniques, the $\omega^4$ tail of ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ lacked direct experimental support. We develop a procedure to extract ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the measured ${\cal D}(\omega)$, based on recent advances in understanding low-frequency excitations in glasses, and apply it to available datasets for diverse glasses. The resulting analysis shows that the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic vibrational spectra of glasses is nontrivially consistent with a broad range of experimental observations. It also further supports that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ makes an additive contribution to ${\cal D}(\omega)$.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have attracted intense interest worldwide that offers several routes to design materials with novel features which can be served various applications. Unfortunately, at present, this method is restricted to a small number of stackable layers. In this work, we report a bulk vdW material consisting of alternative TiS2 and TiSe2 layers vertically arranged as a potential candidate for anode applications. Moreover, with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we explored the effect of high entropy on electrochemical performance of the bulk heterostructure (TSS-HS) by substituting Mo6+ and Al3+ at transition metal site (Ti4+). Solvation shell formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) was also studied using AIMD to determine the Li-coordination. Our DFT and AIMD analysis showed considerable improvement in the performance of high entropy TSS-HS (TSS-HE) as compared to TSS-HS. Factors responsible for enhanced performance of TSS-HE were 1) Less structural deformation, 2) Strong bonding (Metal-Chalcogen), 3) Better ionic mobility, 4) Higher theoretical specific capacity, 5) Wider operational voltage window, and 6) Faster Li-ion diffusion. Our observations suggests that 'high entropy' can be an effective strategy to design new anode materials for improving electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Quantum bit with telecom wave-length emission from a simple defect in Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-to-photon interfaces from defects in silicon hold great promise towards realizing quantum repeaters with the combination of advanced semiconductor and photonics technologies. Recently, controlled creation and erasure of simple carbon interstitial defects have been successfully realised in silicon. This defect has a stable structure near room temperature and emits in the wave-length where the signal loss is minimal in optical fibres used in communication technologies. Our in-depth theoretical characterization confirms the assignment of the observed emission to the neutral charge state of this defect. We find that the emission is due to the recombination of a bound exciton. We also discovered a metastable triplet state that could be applied as a quantum memory. Based on the analysis of the electronic structure of the defect and its similarities to a known optically detected magnetic resonance centre in silicon, we propose that a carbon interstitial can act as a quantum bit and may realize a spin-to-photon interface in CMOS-compatible platforms.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of the semiclassical theory and the response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is long believed that the response theory can give quantum correction (or interband coherent effects) to the semiclassical theory, while both formulations essentially are perturbatively solving the time-dependent Sch\"odinger equation in a periodic potential probed by the electric field within the independent-particle approximation. In this work, by extending the semiclassical theory under a uniform electric field to the nonlinear AC regime, we show explicitly that up to the second order of the electric field, the AC semiclassical theory gives exactly the same results as the response theory in the absence of relaxation. Remarkably, this equivalence can be expected even in DC limit when the zero-frequency divergence is regulated on the same footing. Particularly, at the linear order of the electric field, we show that both formulations deliver the same Drude current, intrinsic anomalous Hall current, and the displacement current, where the last one arising from the time variation of the first-order \textit{positional shift} can only appear in AC transport and is usually overlooked. Furthermore, at the second order of the electric field, we show that all the well-known transport effects, including the nonlinear Drude and Hall effects (that can be driven by the Berry curvature dipole or/and quantum metric dipole) can be derived by both formulations. Additionally, we show that the nonlinear displacement current due to the time variation of the second-order \textit{positional shift} and the nonlinear intrinsic Ohmic current due to the second-order energy correction (which is determined by the first-order \textit{positional shift}) in AC semiclassical theory can also be obtained by response theory.</description>

      <title>Strategy of a separation technique for different particles with the same size and zeta potential: Application of non-additive Asakura-Oosawa theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we use knowledge gained from our recent study to present a technique for separation of nanoparticles such as exosomes, anticancer drugs, and vaccines. The technique involves adding non-adsorptive polymers to a system in which two types of nanoparticles with the same size and zeta potential are dispersed. The different types of nanoparticles can be separated based on differences in their hydrophobicities and softness of the polymer. Using the non-additive Asakura-Oosawa theory and assuming a realistic model system, we were able to separate the two types of the particles with the same size and zeta potential in the model system.</description>

      <title>Six magnetization plateau phases in a kagome antiferromagnet with $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$-type distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently discovered kagome antiferromagnet $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ has attracted significant interest due to its unique kagome lattice structure and magnetic properties. Two separate studies have proposed distinct sets of exchange interaction parameters for this compound. In this study, we investigate the ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg kagome model with three types of nearest-neighbor exchange interactions under a magnetic field by exact diagonalization using the Lanczos method. We reveal that clear magnetization plateaus at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9 are present under both parameter sets, which are identified as magnon crystal states based on their spin structures. Our findings suggest that these plateaus could potentially be experimentally confirmed with magnetization measurements on $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ under a magnetic field of approximately 300 T. Due to the uncertainty in the exchange interactions of $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$, we perform additional calculations by varying these interactions. Consequently, we discover additional plateau phases at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9, each distinctly different from the magnon crystal states.</description>

      <title>Detailed dynamics of a moving magnetic skyrmion lattice in MnSi observed using a small-angle neutron scattering under an alternating electric current flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice formation of swirling textures is ubiquitous in solid-state materials, such as a magnetic skyrmion lattice in chiral magnets. In the magnetic skyrmion lattices, their moving states and dynamics under external perturbations are still unrevealed, although a detailed understanding of the dynamics is crucial to realizing spintronic applications, such as magnetic domain-wall racetrack memory. Here, we report in detail on the transient state of a moving magnetic skyrmion lattice in bulk single-crystalline MnSi under alternating current (AC) using small-angle neutron scattering. A rotation and concomitant broadening of the spot width in the azimuthal direction of the magnetic skyrmion reflections originating from the plastic deformation of the magnetic skyrmion lattice were found only at low AC frequencies, whereas above the threshold AC frequency (ft ~ 0.12 Hz) the rotation was not observed, and the spot width becomes sharper. The observed complex response of the magnetic skyrmion reflections can be explained by the change in dislocation density in the magnetic skyrmion lattice. At frequencies higher than ft, the magnetic skyrmions oscillate removing the dislocations, indicating that the dislocation density is controlled by the AC frequency.</description>

      <title>Comparison of SMC and OMC results in determining the ground-state and meta-stable states solutions for UO$_2$ in DFT+U method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correct prediction of the behavior of UO2 crystal, which is an antiferromagnetic system with strongly-correlated electrons, is possible by using a modified density functional theory, the DFT+U method. In the context of DFT+U, the energy of crystal turns out to be a function with several local minima, the so-called meta-stable states, and the lowest energy state amongst them is identified as the ground state. OMC was a method that were used in DFT+U to determine the ground state. Recently the SMC method was proposed which using only the oxygen electronic spin-polarization degrees of freedom also revealed the multi-minima structure of energy in the DFT+U approach and led to results in good agreement with experiment. In this work, we compare the SMC and OMC results and show that although the ground states of the two methods have similar energies and geometries, the electronic structures have significant differences. Moreover, we show that the GS obtained from SMC is by 0.0022 Ry/(formula unit) above that of OMC. The different GS results from the two methods implies that they search for the minimum-energy state over different subspaces of electron densities and each method alone is not capable to locate the global minimum of the energy. Therefore, to obtain the global-minimum state of energy one has to search over larger subspaces that involve both occupation matrices of U atoms and starting magnetization of O atoms.</description>

Abstract: Quantum technologies like single photon emitters and qubits can be enabled by point defects in semiconductors, with the NV-center in diamond being the most prominent example. There are many different semiconductors, each potentially hosting interesting defects. The symmetry properties of the point defect orbitals can yield useful information about the behavior of the system, such as the interaction with polarized light. We have developed a tool to perform symmetry analysis of point defect orbitals obtained by plane-wave density functional theory simulations. The software tool, named ADAQ-SYM, calculates the characters for each orbital, finds the irreducible representations, and uses selection rules to find which optical transitions are allowed. The capabilities of ADAQ-SYM are demonstrated on several defects in diamond and 4H-SiC. The symmetry analysis explains the different zero phonon line (ZPL) polarization of the hk and kh divacancies in 4H-SiC.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics has emerged as a subfield of spintronics, where an AFM N\'eel vector is used as a state variable. Efficient electric control and detection of the N\'eel vector are critical for spintronic applications. This review article features fundamental properties of AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) as spintronic devices where such electric control and detection can be realized. We emphasize critical requirements for observing a large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in AFMTJs with collinear and noncollinear AFM electrodes, such as a momentum-dependent spin polarization and N\'eel spin currents. We further discuss spin torques in AFMTJs that are capable of N\'eel vector switching. Overall, AFMTJs have potential to become a new standard for spintronics providing larger magnetoresistive effects, few orders of magnitude faster switching speed, and much higher packing density than conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).</description>

      <title>Perspective on descriptors of mechanical behavior of cubic transition-metal carbides and nitrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cubic rocksalt structured transition-metal carbides, nitrides, and related alloys (TMC/Ns) are attractive for a wide variety of applications, notably as hard, wear-resistant material. To-date, valence electron concentration (VEC) is used as a good indicator of stability and mechanical properties of these refractory compounds. In this perspective, we argue for the need for electronic descriptors beyond VEC to explain and predict the mechanical behavior of the cubic TMC/Ns. As such, we point out that descriptors that highlight differences between constituent have been underused, along with semi-empirical models of mechanical properties. Additionally, it appears promising to partition VEC into contribution to ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds and we suggest that such partition could provide more insight into predicting mechanical properties in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biaxial tensile device for transport study of layered materials is described. The device is mounted on the standard 24 pin zero force connector and can be moved between various setups. Compact design of the device makes it suitable for a wide range of studies. In our case, it is placed inside a 50 mm diameter chamber in closed-circle refrigerator and is used in the temperature range 9 K - 310 K. A sample is glued in the center of a polyimide cruciform substrate, the ends of which are connected to a tension system driven by four computer-controlled stepper motors providing tensile force up to 30 N. Computer simulation results and their experimental verification show that tensile strain along one axis depends on the tensile load along perpendicular direction, and this dependence turns out to be relatively strong and exceeds 40%. The operation of the device is demonstrated by studying the effect of deformation on the electrical conductivity of a layered compound 2H-NbS2.</description>

Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a scattering phenomenon occurring in a superconductor (SC) connected to two metallic leads, where an incident electron on one side of the SC emerges on the opposite side as a hole. Despite its significance, CAR detection is often impeded by the prevalent electron tunneling (ET), wherein the incident electron exits on the opposing side as an electron. One approach to augment CAR over ET involves employing two antiparallel ferromagnets across the SC. However, this method is constrained by the low polarization in ferromagnets and necessitates the application of a magnetic field. Altermagnets (AMs) present a promising avenue for detecting and enhancing CAR due to their distinct Fermi surfaces for the two spins. Here, we propose a configuration utilizing two AMs rotated by $90^{\circ}$ with respect to each other on either side of an SC to enhance CAR. We calculate local and nonlocal conductivities across the AM-SC-AM junction using the Landauer-B\"uttiker scattering approach. Our findings reveal that in the strong phase of AMs, CAR overwhelmingly dominates nonlocal transport. In the weak phase, CAR can exhibit significant enhancement for larger values of the altermagnetic parameter compared to the scenario where AMs are in the normal metallic phase. As a function of the length of the SC, the conductivities exhibit oscillations reminiscent of Fabry-P\'erot interference.</description>

Abstract: Ultrafast heating of solids with modern X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) leads to a unique set of conditions that is characterized by the simultaneous presence of heated electrons in a cold ionic lattice. In this work, we analyze the effect of electronic heating on the dynamic structure factor (DSF) in bulk Aluminium (Al) with a face-centered cubic lattice and in silicon (Si) with a crystal diamond structure using first-principles linear-response time-dependent density functional theory simulations. We find a thermally induced red shift of the collective plasmon excitation in both materials. In addition, we show that the heating of the electrons in Al can lead to the formation of a double-plasmon peak due to the extension of the Landau damping region to smaller wavenumbers. Finally, we demonstrate that thermal effects generate a measurable and distinct signature (peak-valley structure) in the DSF of Si at small frequencies. Our simulations indicate that there is a variety of new features in the spectrum of X-ray-driven solids, specifically at finite momentum transfer, which can probed in upcoming X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments at various XFEL facilities.</description>
