      <title>Matching under Imperfectly Transferable Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine matching models with imperfectly transferable utility (ITU). We provide motivating examples, discuss the theoretical foundations of ITU matching models and present methods for estimating them. We also explore connected topics and provide an overview of the related literature. This paper has been submitted as a draft chapter for the Handbook of the Economics of Matching, edited by Che, Chiappori and Salani\'e.</description>

      <title>Limited substitutability, relative price changes and the uplifting of public natural capital values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the global economy continues to grow, ecosystem services tend to stagnate or decline. Economic theory has shown how such shifts in relative scarcities can be reflected in the appraisal of public projects and environmental-economic accounting, but empirical evidence has been lacking to put the theory into practice. To estimate the relative price change in ecosystem services that can be used to make such adjustments, we perform a global meta-analysis of environmental valuation studies to derive income elasticities of willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem services as a proxy for the degree of limited substitutability. Based on 861 income-WTP pairs, we estimate an income elasticity of WTP of around 0.79 (95-CI: 0.60 to 0.97). Combining these results with a global data set on shifts in the relative scarcity of ecosystem services, we estimate relative price change of ecosystem services of around 2.2 percent per year. In an application to natural capital valuation of non-timber forest ecosystem services by the World Bank, we show that their natural capital value should be uplifted by more than 50 percent (95-CI: 32 to 78 percent), materially elevating the role of public natural capital. We discuss implications for relative price adjustments in policy appraisal and for improving estimates of comprehensive national accounts.</description>

      <title>Renewable Energy Integration Strategies: A Transmission Operator's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the role of a transmission system operator within a carbon footprint reduction strategy incorporating carbon taxes and renewable generation subsidies in the decentralised energy market. Moreover, this manuscript offers insights into the influence of various compositions of aforementioned policies on generation mix and social welfare. For that, we employ an optimisation bi-level model in which a welfare-maximizing transmission system operator makes investments in transmission lines at the upper level while considering power market dynamics at the lower level. To account for the deregulated energy market structure, we assume that the generation companies at the lower level make capacity investments as price-takers in perfect competition. Considering alternative transmission infrastructure expansion budgets, carbon emission taxes and monetary incentives for renewable generation capacity expansion, we study how alternative compositions of these factors affect three output factors: the share of renewable generation in the generation mix, total generation amount, and social welfare. We apply the proposed modelling assessment to an illustrative three-node instance and a case study considering a simplified representation of the energy system of the Nordic and Baltic countries. The findings of this study can serve as an additional reference for policymakers seeking to simultaneously increase the proportion of renewable energy generation and total generation amount to meet increasing demand.</description>

      <title>Sustainability assessment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite broadband megaconstellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02338v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of megaconstellations is rapidly increasing the number of rocket launches. While Low Earth Orbit (LEO) broadband satellites help to connect unconnected communities and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are also significant environmental emissions impacts from burning rocket fuels. We present sustainability analytics for phase 1 of the three main LEO constellations including Amazon Kuiper (3,236 satellites), Eutelsat Group`s OneWeb (648 satellites), and SpaceX Starlink (4,425 satellites). We find that LEO megaconstellations provide substantially improved broadband speeds for rural and remote communities, but are roughly 6-8 times more emissions intensive (250 kg CO2eq/subscriber/year) than comparative terrestrial mobile broadband. In the worst-case emissions scenario, this rises to 12-14 times more (469 kg CO2eq/subscriber/year). Policy makers must carefully consider the trade-off between connecting unconnected communities to further the SDGs and mitigating the growing space sector environmental footprint, particularly regarding phase 2 plans to launch an order-of-magnitude more satellites.</description>
