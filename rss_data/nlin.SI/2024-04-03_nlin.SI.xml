      <title>Integrability of Nonabelian Differential-Difference Equations: the Symmetry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to tackle integrability problem for evolutionary differential-difference equations (D$\Delta$Es) on free associative algebras, also referred to as nonabelian D$\Delta$Es. This approach enables us to derive necessary integrability conditions, determine the integrability of a given equation, and make progress in the classification of integrable nonabelian D$\Delta$Es. This work involves establishing symbolic representations for the nonabelian difference algebra, difference operators, and formal series, as well as introducing a novel quasi-local extension for the algebra of formal series within the context of symbolic representations. Applying this formalism, we solve the classification problem of integrable skew-symmetric quasi-linear nonabelian equations of orders $(-1,1)$, $(-2,2)$, and $(-3,3)$, consequently revealing some new equations in the process.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ Rational $Q$-system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bethe ansatz equations for spin-$s$ Heisenberg spin chain with $s\ge1$ are significantly more difficult to analyze than the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ case, due to the presence of repeated roots. As a result, it is challenging to derive extra conditions for the Bethe roots to be physical and study the related completeness problem. In this paper, we propose the rational $Q$-system for the XXX$_s$ spin chain. Solutions of the proposed $Q$-system give all and only physical solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations required by completeness. This is checked numerically and proved rigorously. The rational $Q$-system is equivalent to the requirement that the solution and the corresponding dual solution of the $TQ$-relation are both polynomials, which we prove rigorously. Based on this analysis, we propose the extra conditions for solutions of the XXX$_s$ Bethe ansatz equations to be physical.</description>

      <title>mKdV-Related Flows for Legendrian Curves in the Pseudohermitian 3-Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate geometric evolution equations for Legendrian curves in the 3-sphere which are invariant under the action of the unitary group ${\rm U}(2)$. We define a natural symplectic structure on the space of Legendrian loops and show that the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation, along with its associated hierarchy, are realized as curvature evolutions induced by a sequence of Hamiltonian flows. For the flow among these that induces the mKdV equation, we investigate the geometry of solutions which evolve by rigid motions in ${\rm U}(2)$. Generalizations of our results to higher-order evolutions and curves in similar geometries are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Solution of Classical Turbulence. Decaying Energy Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15470v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper brings to fruition recently found \cite{migdal2023exact} exact reduction of decaying turbulence in the Navier-Stokes equation in $3 + 1$ dimensions to a Number Theory problem of finding the statistical limit of the Euler ensemble. We reformulate the Euler ensemble as a Markov chain and show the equivalence of this formulation to the \textbf{quantum} statistical theory of $N$ fermions on a ring, with an external field related to the random fractions of $\pi$. We find the solution of this system in the turbulent limit $N\to \infty, \nu \to 0$ in terms of a complex trajectory (instanton) providing a saddle point to the path integral over the density of these fermions. This results in an analytic formula for the observable correlation function of vorticity in wavevector space. This is a full solution of decaying turbulence from the first principle without approximations or fitted parameters. The energy spectrum decays as $k^{-\frac{7}{2}}$. We compute resulting integrals in \Mathematica{} and present effective index $n(t) = -t\partial_t \log E$ for the energy decay as a function of time. The asymptotic value of the effective index in energy decay $n(\infty) = \frac{7}{4}$, but the universal function $n(t)$ is neither constant nor linear.</description>
