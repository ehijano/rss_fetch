      <title>Empirical forms of the Petty projection inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Petty projection inequality is a fundamental affine isoperimetric principle for convex sets. It has shaped several directions of research in convex geometry which forged new connections between projection bodies, centroid bodies, and mixed volume inequalities. We establish several different empirical forms of the Petty projection inequality by re-examining these key relationships from a stochastic perspective. In particular, we derive sharp extremal inequalities for several multiple-entry functionals of random convex sets, including mixed projection bodies and mixed volumes.</description>

      <title>On a question of Kolmogorov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov asked the following question: can every bounded measurable set in the plane be mapped onto a polygon by a 1-Lipschitz map with arbitrarily small measure loss? The answer is negative in general, however, the case of compact sets is still open. We present an equivalent form of the question for compact sets. To do this, we prove a variant of Kirszbraun's Lipschitz extension theorem where the supremum distance from the identity is preserved. Furthermore, we give a positive answer to Kolmogorov's question for specific classes of sets, most importantly, for planar sets with tube-null boundary. In particular, we show that the Sierpi\'nski carpet can be mapped into the union of finitely many line segments by a 1-Lipschitz map with arbitrarily small displacements, answering a question of Balka, Elekes and M\'ath\'e.</description>

      <title>Tightening Inequalities on Volume Extremal $k$-Ellipsoids Using Asymmetry Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two well-known problems: upper bounding the volume of lower dimensional ellipsoids contained in convex bodies given their John ellipsoid, and lower bounding the volume of ellipsoids containing projections of convex bodies given their Loewner ellipsoid. For the first problem, we use the John asymmetry to unify a tight upper bound for the general case by Ball with a stronger inequality for symmetric convex bodies. We obtain an inequality that is tight for most asymmetry values in large dimensions and an even stronger inequality in the planar case that is always best possible. In contrast, we show for the second problem an inequality that is tight for bodies of any asymmetry, including cross-polytopes, parallelotopes, and (in almost all cases) simplices. Finally, we derive some consequences for the width-circumradius- and diameter-inradius-ratios when optimized over affine transformations and show connections to the Banach-Mazur distance.</description>

      <title>Partitions of unity and barycentric algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barycentric coordinates provide solutions to the problem of expressing an element of a compact convex set as a convex combination of a finite number of extreme points of the set. They have been studied widely within the geometric literature, typically in response to the demands of interpolation, numerical analysis and computer graphics. In this note we bring an algebraic perspective to the problem, based on barycentric algebras. We focus on the discussion of relations between different subclasses of partitions of unity, one arising in the context of barycentric coordinates, based on the tautological map introduced by Guessab.</description>

      <title>A Stability Version of the Jones Opaque Set Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a bounded, convex set. A set $O \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is an opaque set (for $\Omega$) if every line that intersects $\Omega$ also intersects $O$. What is the minimal possible length $L$ of an opaque set? The best lower bound $L \geq |\partial \Omega|/2$ is due to Jones (1962). It has been remarkably difficult to improve this bound, even in special cases where it is presumably very far from optimal. We prove a stability version: if $L - |\partial \Omega|/2$ is small, then any corresponding opaque set $O$ has to be made up of curves whose tangents behave very much like the tangents of the boundary $\partial \Omega$ in a precise sense.</description>

      <title>Sharp conditions for preserving uniformity, doubling measure and Poincar\'e inequality under sphericalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sphericalization, which is a mapping that conformally deforms the metric and the measure of an unbounded metric measure space so that the deformed space is bounded. The goal of this paper is to study sharp conditions on the deforming density function under which the sphericalization preserves uniformity of the space, the doubling property of the measure and the support of a Poincar\'e inequality. We also provide examples that demonstrate the sharpness of our conditions.</description>

      <title>A remark on dimensionality reduction in discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove a version of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss flattening Lemma for point sets taking values in discrete subgroups. More precisely, given $d,\lambda_0,N_0\in\mathbb{N}$, a point set $\mathcal{D}\subset\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\mathbb{Z}^d\cap B(0,N_0)$ with cardinality $|\mathcal{D}|=d$, and $\epsilon\in \left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ suitably chosen, we show that there exist a scaling factor $\lambda=\lambda(\epsilon,N_0)\in\mathbb{N}$ that does not depend on the dimension $d$, and an (affine) embedding $F:\mathcal{D}\to\frac{1}{\lambda}\mathbb{Z}^k$, where $k=k(d,\epsilon)=O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\log d\right)$, with distortion at most $\left(1+\epsilon+\frac{\epsilon}{\lambda_0}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Quasisymmetric uniformization of cellular branched covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of branched covering maps on topological $n$-spheres $\mathcal{S}^n$ called expanding cellular Markov branched covers which might be viewed as analogs of expanding Thurston maps. Similarly as expanding Thurston maps, expanding cellular Markov branched covers admit visual metrics. In this paper, we study the quasisymmetric uniformization problem corresponding to visual metrics of expanding cellular Markov branched covers. More precisely, for a cellular Markov branched cover $f\colon \mathbb{S}^n\to \mathbb{S}^n$ and a visual metric $\varrho$ of $f$, we prove that $\varrho$ is quasisymmetrically equivalent to the chordal metric if and only if $f$ is uniformly quasiregular, and the local multiplicity of the family $\{f^m\}_{m\in\mathbb{N}}$ is bounded uniformly.</description>

      <title>Trading linearity for ellipticity: a nonsmooth approach to Einstein's theory of gravity and the Lorentzian splitting theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Einstein's theory of gravity is formulated in a smooth setting, the celebrated singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose describe many physical situations in which this smoothness must eventually break down. In positive-definite signature, there is a highly successful theory of metric and metric-measure geometry which includes Riemannian manifolds as a special case, but permits the extraction of nonsmooth limits under dimension and curvature bounds analogous to the energy conditions from relativity: here sectional curvature is reformulated through triangle comparison, while Ricci curvature is reformulated using entropic convexity along geodesics of probability measures.
  This lecture highlights recent progress in the development of an analogous theory in Lorentzian signature, whose ultimate goal is to provide a nonsmooth theory of gravity. In particular, we foreshadow a low-regularity splitting theorem obtained by sacrificing linearity of the d'Alembertian to recover ellipticity. We exploit a negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator for this purpose. The same technique yields a simplified proof of Eschenberg (1988), Galloway (1989), and Newman's (1990) confirmation of Yau's (1982) conjecture, bringing both Lorentzian splitting results into a framework closer to the Cheeger--Gromoll (1971) splitting theorem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Condition for Uniqueness of Fr\'echet Means of Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean is an important statistical summary and measure of centrality of data; it has been defined and studied for persistent homology captured by persistence diagrams. However, the complicated geometry of the space of persistence diagrams implies that the Fr\'echet mean for a given set of persistence diagrams is not necessarily unique, which prohibits theoretical guarantees for empirical means with respect to population means. In this paper, we derive a variance expression for a set of persistence diagrams exhibiting a multi-matching between the persistence points known as a grouping. Moreover, we propose a condition for groupings, which we refer to as flatness; we prove that sets of persistence diagrams that exhibit flat groupings give rise to unique Fr\'echet means. We derive a finite sample convergence result for general groupings, which results in convergence for Fr\'echet means if the groupings are flat. We then interpret flat groupings in a recently-proposed general framework of Fr\'echet means in Alexandrov geometry. Finally, we show that for manifold-valued data, the persistence diagrams can be truncated to construct flat groupings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, as a first contribution, we provide alternative proofs of recent results by Harrison and Jeffs which determine the precise value of the Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) distance between the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$ and the $n$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ (for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$) when endowed with their respective geodesic metrics. Additionally, we prove that the GH distance between $\mathbb{S}^3$ and $\mathbb{S}^4$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2}\arccos\left(\frac{-1}{4}\right)$, thus settling the case $n=3$ of a conjecture by Lim, M\'emoli and Smith.</description>

      <title>The fractional chromatic number of the plane is at least 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of the unit distance graph of the Euclidean plane is greater than or equal to $4$. Notably, however, we cannot present a finite subgraph $G$ of the plane such that $\chi_f(G)\ge 4$. Instead, we utilize the concept of geometric fractional chromatic number $\chi_{gf}(G)$, which was introduced recently in connection with density bounds for 1-avoiding sets.
  First, as $G$ ranges over finite subgraphs of the plane, we establish that the supremum of $\chi_f(G)$ is the same as that of $\chi_{gf}(G)$. The proof exploits the amenability of the group of Euclidean transformations in dimension 2 and, as such, we do not know whether the analogous statement holds in higher dimensions. We then present a specific planar unit distance graph $G$ on 27 vertices such that $\chi_{gf}(G)=4$.</description>

      <title>Universal coarse geometry of spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of realizing highly entangled states on quantum processors with fundamentally different hardware geometries raises the question: to what extent does a state of a quantum spin system have an intrinsic geometry? In this paper, we propose that both states and dynamics of a spin system have a canonically associated coarse geometry, in the sense of Roe, on the set of sites in the thermodynamic limit. For a state $\phi$ on an (abstract) spin system with an infinite collection of sites $X$, we define a universal coarse structure $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}$ on the set $X$ with the property that a state has decay of correlations with respect to a coarse structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ if and only if $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}\subseteq \mathcal{E}$. We show that under mild assumptions, the coarsely connected completion $(\mathcal{E}_{\phi})_{con}$ is stable under quasi-local perturbations of the state $\phi$. We also develop in parallel a dynamical coarse structure for arbitrary quantum channels, and prove a similar stability result. We show that several order parameters of a state only depend on the coarse structure of an underlying spatial metric, and we establish a basic compatibility between the dynamical coarse structure associated to a quantum circuit $\alpha$ and the coarse structure of the state $\psi\circ \alpha$ where $\psi$ is any product state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of four manifolds with macroscopic dimension 4 equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. Further, we verify that these bundles have macroscopic dimension at most 3. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s similarity conjecture was proposed by P. Erd\H{o}s in 1974. The conjecture remains open for exponentially decaying sequences as well as Cantor sets that have both Newhouse thickness and Hausdorff dimension zero. In this article, written after 50 years of the conjecture being proposed, we review progress on some new variants of the original problem: namely, the bi-Lipschitz variant, the topological variant, and a variant ``in the large''. These problems were recently studied by the authors and their collaborators. Each of them offers new perspectives on the original conjecture.</description>
