      <title>An Isometric Embedding of a Bounded Set in a Euclidean Space into the Gromov-Hausdorff Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an isometric embedding of a bounded set in a Euclidean space into the Gromov-Hausdorff space. In particular, we can embed a bounded and connected Riemannian manifold into the Gromov-Hausdorff space by a bilipschitz map.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral structure of maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces with finite boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary $\partial X$ of a boundary continuous Gromov hyperbolic space $X$ carries a natural Moebius structure on the boundary. For a proper, geodesically complete, boundary continuous Gromov hyperbolic space $X$, the boundary $\partial X$ equipped with its cross-ratio is a particular kind of quasi-metric space, called a quasi-metric antipodal space. Given a quasi-metric antipodal space $Z$, one may consider the family of all hyperbolic fillings of $Z$. In \cite{biswas2024quasi} it was shown that this family has a unique upper bound $\mathcal{M}(Z)$ (with respect to a natural partial order on hyperbolic fillings of $Z$), which can be described explicitly in terms of the cross-ratio on $Z$. As shown in \cite{biswas2024quasi}, the spaces $\mathcal{M}(Z)$ constitute a natural class of spaces called maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces.
  A natural problem is to describe explicitly the maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces $X$ whose boundary $\partial X$ is finite. We show that for a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space $X$ with boundary $\partial X$ of cardinality $n$, the space $X$ is isometric to a finite polyhedral complex embedded in $(\mathbb{R}^n, ||.||_{\infty})$ with cells of dimension at most $n/2$, given by attaching $n$ half-lines to vertices of a compact polyhedral complex. In particular the geometry at infinity of $X$ is trivial. The combinatorics of the polyhedral complex is determined by certain relations $R \subset \partial X \times \partial X$ on the boundary $\partial X$, called antipodal relations.
  In \cite{biswas2024quasi} it was shown that maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces are injective metric spaces. We give a shorter, simpler proof of this fact in the case of spaces with finite boundary. We also consider the space of deformations of a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space with finite boundary, and define an associated Teichmuller space.</description>

      <title>The Klain approach to zonal valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show an analogue of the Klain-Schneider theorem for valuations that are invariant under rotations around a fixed axis, called zonal. Using this, we establish a new integral representation of zonal valuations involving mixed area measures with a disk. In our argument, we introduce an easy way to translate between this representation and the one involving area measures, yielding a shorter proof of a recent characterization by Knoerr. As applications, we obtain various zonal integral geometric formulas, extending results by Hug, Mussnig, and Ulivelli. Finally, we provide a simpler proof of the integral representation of the mean section operators by Goodey and Weil.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of size-2 positive semidefinite matrix factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize when a size-2 positive semidefinite (psd) factorization of a positive matrix of rank 3 and psd rank 2 is unique. The characterization is obtained using tools from rigidity theory. In the first step, we define s-infinitesimally rigid psd factorizations and characterize 1- and 2-infinitesimally rigid size-2 psd factorizations. In the second step, we connect 1- and 2-infinitesimal rigidity of size-2 psd factorizations to uniqueness via global rigidity. We also prove necessary conditions on a positive matrix of rank 3 and psd rank 2 to be on the topological boundary of all nonnegative matrices with the same rank conditions.</description>

      <title>Exponential odd-distance sets under the Manhattan metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a set of $2^n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that all pairwise Manhattan distances are odd integers, which improves the recent linear lower bound of Golovanov, Kupavskii and Sagdeev. In contrast to the Euclidean and maximum metrics, this shows that the odd-distance set problem behaves very differently to the equilateral set problem under the Manhattan metric. Moreover, all coordinates of the points in our construction are integers or half-integers, and we show that our construction is optimal under this additional restriction.</description>

      <title>Uniform diameter estimates for Kaehler metrics in big cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize previous diameter estimates and local non-vanishing of volumes for Kaehler metrics to the case of big cohomology classes. In our proof, among other things, we will prove a uniform diameter estimate for a family of smooth Kaehler metrics only involving an integrability condition. We also have to use fine stability properties of complex Monge-Ampere equations with prescribed singularities.</description>

      <title>Surgery and positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preserving weighted Riemannian metrics of positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature along surgery. We establish two theorems of this type: One for connected sums, and one for surgeries along higher-dimensional spheres. In contrast to known surgery results for positive Ricci curvature, these results are local, i.e. we only impose assumptions on the weighted metric locally around the sphere along which the surgery is performed. As application we then show that all closed, simply-connected spin 5-manifolds admit a weighted Riemannian metric of positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. By a result of Lott, this also provides new examples of manifolds with a Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Fractional $p$-Laplacians via Neumann problems in unbounded metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness, Harnack inequality and sharp regularity of solutions to a fractional $p$-Laplace non-homogeneous equation $(-\Delta_p)^su =f$, with $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, for data $f$ satisfying a weighted $L^{p'}$ condition in a doubling metric measure space $(Z,d_Z,\nu)$ that is possibly unbounded. Our approach is inspired by the work of Caffarelli and Silvestre \cite{CS} (see also Mol{\v{c}}anov and Ostrovski{\u{i}} \cite{MO}), and extends the techniques developed in
  \cite{CKKSS}, where the bounded case is studied. Unlike in \cite{EbGKSS}, we do not assume that $Z$ supports a Poincar\'e inequality. The proof is based on the well-posedness of the Neumann problem on a Gromov hyperbolic space $(X,d_X, \mu)$ that arises as an hyperbolic filling of $Z$.</description>

      <title>Tubes in sub-Riemannian geometry and a Weyl's invariance result for curves in the Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the paper is threefold: first, we prove optimal regularity results for the distance from $C^k$ submanifolds of general rank-varying sub-Riemannian structures. Then, we study the asymptotics of the volume of tubular neighbourhoods around such submanifolds. Finally, for the case of curves in the Heisenberg groups, we prove a Weyl's invariance result: the volume of small tubes around a curve does not depend on the way the curve is isometrically embedded, but only on its Reeb angle. The proof does not need the computation of the actual volume of the tube, and it is new even for the three-dimensional Heisenberg group.</description>
