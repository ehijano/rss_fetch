      <title>New intelligent empowerment for digital transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes an innovative evaluation method based on large language models (LLMs) specifically designed to measure the digital transformation (DT) process of enterprises. By analyzing the annual reports of 4407 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq from 2005 to 2022, a comprehensive set of DT indicators was constructed. The findings revealed that DT significantly improves a company's financial performance, however, different digital technologies exhibit varying effects on financial performance. Specifically, blockchain technology has a relatively limited positive impact on financial performance. In addition, this study further discovered that DT can promote the growth of financial performance by enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs. This study provides a novel DT evaluation tool for the academic community, while also expanding the application scope of generative artificial intelligence technology in economic research.</description>

      <title>A Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure for NLP Stock Return Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure in the context of a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach for stock return and volatility forecasting. A novel sentiment score equation is proposed to represent the impact of intraday news on forecasting next-period stock return and volatility for selected U.S. semiconductor tickers, a very vibrant industry sector. This work improves the forecast accuracy by addressing news bias, memory, and weight, and incorporating shifts in sentiment direction. More importantly, it extends the use of the remarkable tool of change of Probability Measure developed in the finance of Asset Pricing to NLP forecasting by constructing a Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure, obtained from a redistribution of the weights in the probability space, meant to correct for excessive or insufficient news.</description>

      <title>Marketron games: Self-propelling stocks vs dumb money and metastable dynamics of the Good, Bad and Ugly markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of price formation in an inelastic market whose dynamics are partially driven by both money flows and their impact on asset prices. The money flow to the market is viewed as an investment policy of outside investors. For the price impact effect, we use an impact function that incorporates the phenomena of market inelasticity and saturation from new money (the $dumb \; money$ effect). Due to the dependence of market investors' flows on market performance, the model implies a feedback mechanism that gives rise to nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, the market price dynamics are seen as a nonlinear diffusion of a particle (the $marketron$) in a two-dimensional space formed by the log-price $x$ and a memory variable $y$. The latter stores information about past money flows, so that the dynamics are non-Markovian in the log price $x$ alone, but Markovian in the pair $(x,y)$, bearing a strong resemblance to spiking neuron models in neuroscience. In addition to market flows, the model dynamics are partially driven by return predictors, modeled as unobservable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. By using a new interpretation of predictive signals as $self$-$propulsion$ components of the price dynamics, we treat the marketron as an active particle, amenable to methods developed in the physics of active matter. We show that, depending on the choice of parameters, our model can produce a rich variety of interesting dynamic scenarios. In particular, it predicts three distinct regimes of the market, which we call the $Good$, the $Bad$, and the $Ugly$ markets. The latter regime describes a scenario of a total market collapse or, alternatively, a corporate default event, depending on whether our model is applied to the whole market or an individual stock.</description>
