      <title>Audio-visual cross-modality knowledge transfer for machine learning-based in-situ monitoring in laser additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various machine learning (ML)-based in-situ monitoring systems have been developed to detect laser additive manufacturing (LAM) process anomalies and defects. Multimodal fusion can improve in-situ monitoring performance by acquiring and integrating data from multiple modalities, including visual and audio data. However, multimodal fusion employs multiple sensors of different types, which leads to higher hardware, computational, and operational costs. This paper proposes a cross-modality knowledge transfer (CMKT) methodology that transfers knowledge from a source to a target modality for LAM in-situ monitoring. CMKT enhances the usefulness of the features extracted from the target modality during the training phase and removes the sensors of the source modality during the prediction phase. This paper proposes three CMKT methods: semantic alignment, fully supervised mapping, and semi-supervised mapping. Semantic alignment establishes a shared encoded space between modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. It utilizes a semantic alignment loss to align the distributions of the same classes (e.g., visual defective and audio defective classes) and a separation loss to separate the distributions of different classes (e.g., visual defective and audio defect-free classes). The two mapping methods transfer knowledge by deriving the features of one modality from the other modality using fully supervised and semi-supervised learning. The proposed CMKT methods were implemented and compared with multimodal audio-visual fusion in an LAM in-situ anomaly detection case study. The semantic alignment method achieves a 98.4% accuracy while removing the audio modality during the prediction phase, which is comparable to the accuracy of multimodal fusion (98.2%).</description>

      <title>Research on Heterogeneous Computation Resource Allocation based on Data-driven Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of the mobile Internet and the Internet of Things is leading to a diversification of user devices and the emergence of new mobile applications on a regular basis. Such applications include those that are computationally intensive, such as pattern recognition, interactive gaming, virtual reality, and augmented reality. However, the computing and energy resources available on the user's equipment are limited, which presents a challenge in effectively supporting such demanding applications. In this work, we propose a heterogeneous computing resource allocation model based on a data-driven approach. The model first collects and analyzes historical workload data at scale, extracts key features, and builds a detailed data set. Then, a data-driven deep neural network is used to predict future resource requirements. Based on the prediction results, the model adopts a dynamic adjustment and optimization resource allocation strategy. This strategy not only fully considers the characteristics of different computing resources, but also accurately matches the requirements of various tasks, and realizes dynamic and flexible resource allocation, thereby greatly improving the overall performance and resource utilization of the system. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly better than the traditional resource allocation method in a variety of scenarios, demonstrating its excellent accuracy and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of Non-parameterized Ventilated Acoustic Resonator via Variational Autoencoder with Acoustic Response-encoded Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ventilated acoustic resonator(VAR), a type of acoustic metamaterial, emerge as an alternative for sound attenuation in environments that require ventilation, owing to its excellent low-frequency attenuation performance and flexible shape adaptability. However, due to the non-linear acoustic responses of VARs, the VAR designs are generally obtained within a limited parametrized design space, and the design relies on the iteration of the numerical simulation which consumes a considerable amount of computational time and resources. This paper proposes an acoustic response-encoded variational autoencoder (AR-VAE), a novel variational autoencoder-based generative design model for the efficient and accurate inverse design of VAR even with non-parametrized designs. The AR-VAE matches the high-dimensional acoustic response with the VAR cross-section image in the dimension-reduced latent space, which enables the AR-VAE to generate various non-parametrized VAR cross-section images with the target acoustic response. AR-VAE generates non-parameterized VARs from target acoustic responses, which show a 25-fold reduction in mean squared error compared to conventional deep learning-based parameter searching methods while exhibiting lower average mean squared error and peak frequency variance. By combining the inverse-designed VARs by AR-VAE, multi-cavity VAR was devised for broadband and multitarget peak frequency attenuation. The proposed design method presents a new approach for structural inverse-design with a high-dimensional non-linear physical response.</description>

      <title>HyperCAN: Hypernetwork-Driven Deep Parameterized Constitutive Models for Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce HyperCAN, a machine learning framework that utilizes hypernetworks to construct adaptable constitutive artificial neural networks for a wide range of beam-based metamaterials exhibiting diverse mechanical behavior under finite deformations. HyperCAN integrates an input convex network that models the nonlinear stress-strain map of a truss lattice, while ensuring adherence to fundamental mechanics principles, along with a hypernetwork that dynamically adjusts the parameters of the convex network as a function of the lattice topology and geometry. This unified framework demonstrates robust generalization in predicting the mechanical behavior of previously unseen metamaterial designs and loading scenarios well beyond the training domain. We show how HyperCAN can be integrated into multiscale simulations to accurately capture the highly nonlinear responses of large-scale truss metamaterials, closely matching fully resolved simulations while significantly reducing computational costs. This offers new efficient opportunities for the multiscale design and optimization of truss metamaterials.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic, brittle damage model for finite strains with a generic damage tensor regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a universal framework for the nonlocal modeling of anisotropic damage at finite strains. By the combination of two recent works, the new framework allows for the flexible incorporation of different established hyperelastic finite strain material formulations into anisotropic damage whilst ensuring mesh-independent results by employing a generic set of micromorphic gradient-extensions. First, the anisotropic damage model, generally satisfying the damage growth criterion, is investigated for the specific choice of a Neo-Hookean material on a single element. Next, the model is applied with different gradient-extensions in structural simulations of an asymmetrically notched specimen to identify an efficient choice in the form of a volumetric-deviatoric regularization. Thereafter, the universal framework, which is without loss of generality here specified for a Neo-Hookean material with a volumetric-deviatoric gradient-extension, successfully serves for the complex simulation of a pressure loaded rotor blade.
  After acceptance of the manuscript, we make the codes of the material subroutines accessible to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11171630.</description>

      <title>Online Vehicle Routing with Pickups and Deliveries under Time-Dependent Travel-Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06324v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem with pickups, deliveries and spatiotemporal service constraints ($VRPPDSTC$) is a quite challenging algorithmic problem that can be dealt with in either an offline or an online fashion. In this work, we focus on a generalization, called $VRPPDSTCtd$, in which the travel-time metric is \emph{time-dependent}: the traversal-time per road segment (represented as a directed arc) is determined by some function of the departure-time from its tail towards its head. Time-dependence makes things much more complicated, even for the simpler problem of computing earliest-arrival-time paths which is a crucial subroutine to be solved (numerous times) by $VRPPDSTCtd$ schedulers.
  We propose two \emph{online} schedulers of requests to workers, one which is a time-dependent variant of the classical Plain-Insertion heuristic, and an extension of it trying to digest some sort of forecasts for future demands for service. We enrich these two online schedulers with two additional heuristics, one targeting for distance-balanced assignments of work loads to the workers and another that makes local-search-improvements to the produced solutions.
  We conduct a careful experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms on a real-world instance, with or without these heuristics, and compare their quality with human-curated assignments provided by professional experts (human operators at actual pickup-and-delivery control centers), and also with feasible solutions constructed from a relaxed MILP formulation of $VRPPDSTCtd$, which is also introduced in this paper.
  Our findings are quite encouraging, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms produce solutions which (i) are significant improvements over the human-curated assignments, and (ii) have overall quality pretty close to that of the (extremely time-consuming) solutions provided by an exact solver for the MILP formulation.</description>

      <title>Advancing oncology with federated learning: transcending boundaries in breast, lung, and prostate cancer. A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of centralised machine learning (ML) in oncology, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns and harnessing the power of diverse, multi-center data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on the state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Distinct from previous surveys, our comprehensive review critically evaluates the real-world implementation and impact of FL on cancer care, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability, performance and data privacy in clinical settings and data. We evaluated state-of-the-art advances in FL, demonstrating its growing adoption amid tightening data privacy regulations. FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of the 25 studies reviewed, spanning diverse ML models and clinical applications, and facilitating integration of multi-modal information for precision medicine. Despite the current challenges identified in reproducibility, standardisation and methodology across studies, the demonstrable benefits of FL in harnessing real-world data and addressing clinical needs highlight its significant potential for advancing cancer research. We propose that future research should focus on addressing these limitations and investigating further advanced FL methods, to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.</description>

      <title>The impact of internal variability on benchmarking deep learning climate emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We implement a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and find that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally-resolved surface-level climate variables. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. We identify that this outcome is a result of high levels of internal variability in the benchmark targets. To address internal variability, we update the benchmark targets with ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model that contain 50 instead of 3 climate simulations per emission pathway. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based model for emulating precipitation. We publish our code, data, and an interactive tutorial at github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.</description>

      <title>FiST-Financial Style Transfer with Hallucination and Creativity Control Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial report generation using general purpose large language models pose two major challenges, including the lack of compound sentences and hallucinations. Advanced prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques are incapable of curing the writing style discrepancies. In this work we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning process wherein public domain financial reports are processed into prompt-completions and augmented using simple LLM prompts to then enable sectional financial report generation using minimal instructions and tabular data inputs. Our proposed fine-tuning framework results doubles the number of correct questions answers and reduces hallucinations by over 50%. Additionally, the two-stage fine tuned models have lower perplexity, improved ROUGE, TER and BLEU scores, higher creativity and knowledge density with lower uncertainty and cross entropy.</description>

      <title>CryoBench: Diverse and challenging datasets for the heterogeneity problem in cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining high-resolution 3D biomolecular structures from imaging data. As this technique can capture dynamic biomolecular complexes, 3D reconstruction methods are increasingly being developed to resolve this intrinsic structural heterogeneity. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks with ground truth structures and validation metrics limits the advancement of the field. Here, we propose CryoBench, a suite of datasets, metrics, and performance benchmarks for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM. We propose five datasets representing different sources of heterogeneity and degrees of difficulty. These include conformational heterogeneity generated from simple motions and random configurations of antibody complexes and from tens of thousands of structures sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation. We also design datasets containing compositional heterogeneity from mixtures of ribosome assembly states and 100 common complexes present in cells. We then perform a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art heterogeneous reconstruction tools including neural and non-neural methods and their sensitivity to noise, and propose new metrics for quantitative comparison of methods. We hope that this benchmark will be a foundational resource for analyzing existing methods and new algorithmic development in both the cryo-EM and machine learning communities.</description>

      <title>Meta-heuristic Optimizer Inspired by the Philosophy of Yi Jing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the philosophy of Yi Jing, the Yin-Yang pair optimization (YYPO) algorithm has been shown to achieve competitive performance in single objective optimizations, in addition to the advantage of low time complexity when compared to other population-based meta-heuristics. Building upon a reversal concept in Yi Jing, we propose the novel Yi optimization (YI) algorithm. Specifically, we enhance the Yin-Yang pair in YYPO with a proposed Yi-point, in which we use Cauchy flight to update the solution, by implementing both the harmony and reversal concept of Yi Jing. The proposed Yi-point balances both the effort of exploration and exploitation in the optimization process. To examine YI, we use the IEEE CEC 2017 benchmarks and compare YI against the dynamical YYPO, CV1.0 optimizer, and four classical optimizers, i.e., the differential evolution, the genetic algorithm, the particle swarm optimization, and the simulated annealing. According to the experimental results, YI shows highly competitive performance while keeping the low time complexity. The results of this work have implications for enhancing a meta-heuristic optimizer using the philosophy of Yi Jing. While this work implements only certain aspects of Yi Jing, we envisage enhanced performance by incorporating other aspects.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework Utilizing Machine Learning for Robust Predictive Maintenance: Enhancing Tire Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel digital twin framework for predictive maintenance of long-term physical systems. Using monitoring tire health as an application, we show how the digital twin framework can be used to enhance automotive safety and efficiency, and how the technical challenges can be overcome using a three-step approach. Firstly, for managing the data complexity over a long operation span, we employ data reduction techniques to concisely represent physical tires using historical performance and usage data. Relying on these data, for fast real-time prediction, we train a transformer-based model offline on our concise dataset to predict future tire health over time, represented as Remaining Casing Potential (RCP). Based on our architecture, our model quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, providing reliable confidence intervals around predicted RCP. Secondly, to incorporate real-time data, we update the predictive model in the digital twin framework, ensuring its accuracy throughout its life span with the aid of hybrid modeling and the use of discrepancy function. Thirdly, to assist decision making in predictive maintenance, we implement a Tire State Decision Algorithm, which strategically determines the optimal timing for tire replacement based on RCP forecasted by our transformer model. This approach ensures our digital twin accurately predicts system health, continually refines its digital representation, and supports predictive maintenance decisions. Our framework effectively embodies a physical system, leveraging big data and machine learning for predictive maintenance, model updates, and decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban populations continue to grow, highlighting the critical need to safeguard civilians against potential disruptions, such as dangerous gas contaminant dispersion. The digital twin (DT) framework offers promise in analyzing and predicting such events. This study presents a computational framework for modelling airborne contaminant dispersion in built environments. Leveraging automatic generation of computational domains and solution processes, the proposed framework solves the underlying physical model equations with the finite element method (FEM) for numerical solutions. Model order reduction (MOR) methods are investigated to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. The study outlines the automatic model generation process, the details of the employed model, and the future perspectives for the realization of a DT. Throughout this research, the aim is to develop a reliable predictive model combining physics and data in a hybrid DT to provide informed real-time support within evacuation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemistry plays a crucial role in many domains, such as drug discovery and material science. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit remarkable capabilities on natural language processing tasks, existing research indicates that their performance on chemistry tasks is discouragingly low. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus by a substantial margin. To accomplish this, we propose SMolInstruct, a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality dataset for instruction tuning. It contains 14 selected chemistry tasks and over three million samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. Using SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks. Our analysis further demonstrates the critical role of the proposed dataset in driving the performance improvements.</description>
