      <title>Polymer Topology and the Depletion Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a theoretical model we show that ideal ring polymers are stronger depletants than ideal linear polymers of equal radii of gyration, but not of equal hydrodynamic radii. The difference in the depletion-induced force profile is largely controlled by the thickness of the depletion layer. Theory suggests that this thickness is equal to the average extent of a polymer along the direction perpendicular to the surfaces of the colloids. Within the limits of finite-size effects, Molecular Dynamics simulations support this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Hydration Free Energies of Linear Alkanes: Evaluating and Correcting Classical Force Field Predictions with Different Water Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common force fields tend to overestimate the hydration free energies of hydrophobic solutes, leading to an exaggerated hydrophobic effect. We compute the hydration free energies of linear alkanes from methane to eicosane (C$_{20}$H$_{42}$) using free energy perturbation with various three-site (SPC/E, OPC3) and four-site (TIP4P/2005, OPC) water models and the TraPPE-UA force field for alkanes. All water models overestimate the hydration free energies, though the four-site models perform better than the three-site ones. By utilizing cavity free energies, we reparameterize the alkane--water well depth to bring simulation results in agreement with experimental and group-contribution estimates. We find that the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) combined with TIP4P/2005 water provides closer estimates of the hydration free energy. The HH alkane model (a reparameterized TraPPE-UA force field) with TIP4P/2005 reproduces experimental hydration free energies. We also show that applying a shifted Lennard--Jones potential leads to systematic deviations in the hydration free energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Combined effects of particle geometry and applied vibrations on the mechanics and strength of entangled materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled materials offer attractive structural features including tensile strength and large deformations, combined with infinite assembly and disassembly capabilities. How the geometry of individual particles governs entanglement, and in turn translates into macroscopic structural properties, provides a rich landscape in terms of mechanics and offers intriguing possibilities in terms of structural design. Despite this potential, there are major knowledge gaps on the entanglement mechanisms and how they can generate strength. In particular, vibrations are known to have strong effects on entanglement and disentanglement but the exact mechanisms underlying these observations are unknown. In this report we present tensile tests and discrete element method (DEM) simulations on bundles of entangled staple-like particles that capture the combined effects of particle geometry and vibrations on local entanglement, tensile force chains and strength. We show that standard steel staples with $\theta = 90^\circ$ crown-leg angle initially entangle better than $\theta = 20^\circ$ modified staples because of their more "open" geometry. However, as vibrations are applied entanglement increase faster in $\theta = 20^\circ$ bundles, so that they develop strong and stable tensile force chains, producing bundles which are almost ten times stronger than $\theta = 90^\circ$ bundles. Both tensile strength and entanglement density increase with vibrations and also with deformations, up to a steady state value. At that point the rate of entanglement equals the rate of disentanglement, and each of these rates remains relatively high. Finally, we show that vibration can be used as a manipulation strategy to either entangle or disentangle staple-like entangled granular materials, with confinement playing a significant role in determining whether vibration promotes entanglement or disentanglement.</description>

      <title>Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.</description>

      <title>Fluidity and morphological stability of an amorphous thin film with radiation-induced defect kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common to model ion-irradiated amorphous thin films as if they were highly viscous fluids. In such models, one is frequently concerned with the ion-enhanced fluidity, a measure of the ability of the free interface to relax surface energy. Motivated by usual fluid dynamics problems, the ion-enhanced fluidity is near-universally treated as a constant throughout the amorphous layer. However, for an irradiated thin film, the fluidity is ultimately caused by radiation-induced defect kinetics within the film, leading to regions with greater or lesser fluidity, and sensitive dependence on ion energy, species, flux, irradiation angle, temperature, and other experimental parameters. Here, we develop and analyze a model of radiation-induced defect kinetics coupled to the continuum equations of a viscous thin film. Using realistic parameter values, we show that defect kinetics can meaningfully alter theoretical predictions of surface relaxation and ion-enhanced fluidity. Implications for aligning theoretical and experimental work, especially for surface nano-patterning of silicon induced by low-energy argon irradiation, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of elastic inhomogeneity on collective dynamical properties investigated by field theoretical description in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting the vibrational properties of amorphous solids beyond Debye's theory is challenging due to the presence of inhomogeneity on the mesoscopic scale. In this work, we model this inhomogeneity by real-space fluctuating elasticity with a spatially correlated distribution and calculate the dynamical properties using an exact real-space field theoretical approach. Our results clarify that the excess low-frequency density of states (DOS) originates from a selective scattering effect (stronger scattering of short wavelengths) induced by elastic inhomogeneity. The visualization of the local DOS in real space reveals the existence of anomalous modes, highly excited spots, at low frequencies. The findings regarding these highly excited spots and the selectivity of the correlation length were missed in previous perturbative field approaches in wave-vector space, and they align with recent progress from particle-level simulations and experiments. These results provide concrete insights into the low-frequency vibrational anomaly of amorphous solids from the perspective of simple elastic inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Thin-film flows of granular suspensions on a solid surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article examines the complex dynamics of thin-film flows of granular suspensions spreading over rigid solid substrates with free air interfaces. Such systems feature an involved coupling of the free-surface dynamics with the flow and microstructure of the suspension. In particular, we develop two canonical thin-film situations: drop spreading and dip-coating. In drop spreading, confinement of the particulate phase near the advancing contact line alters both the spreading rate and the interface shape. In dip-coating, understanding the entrainment of fluid and particles becomes challenging as the film thickness approaches the particle size.</description>

      <title>Behavior of passive polymeric tracers of different topologies in a dilute bath of active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using computer simulations in two dimensions we investigate the dynamics and structure of passive polymeric tracer with different topologies immersed in a low-density active particle bath. One of the key observations is that polymer exhibit faster dynamics compared to passive colloidal particles at high activity, for the same particle density, in both linear and star polymer topologies. This enhanced motion is attributed to the accumulation of active particles, which induces prolonged and persistent movement of the polymer. Further analysis reveals that star polymers exhibit more complex and intriguing behavior than their linear counterparts. Notably, the accumulation of active particles promotes the pairing of arms in star polymers. For instance, a three-armed star polymer adopts a conformation similar to a linear polymer with two-arms due to this pairing as a result, at high activity, the dynamics of both the polymers converge. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a linear polymer with the same total number of beads as the star polymer. Interestingly, at high activity -- where arm pairing in the star polymer is significant -- the star polymer demonstrates faster dynamics than the linear polymer, despite having the identical number of beads. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interactions between active and passive components of varying topologies in dilute systems and highlight their potential for innovative applications ranging from materials science to biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Disorder to Order Transition in 1D Nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extensively study the phenomenology of one dimensional Nonreciprocal Cahn Hilliard model for varying nonreciprocity $(\alpha)$ and different boundary conditions. At small $\alpha$, a perturbed uniform state evolves to a defect laden configuration that lacks global polar order. Defects are the sources and sinks of travelling waves and nonreciprocity selects defects with a unique wave number that increases monotonically with $\alpha_c$. A critical threshold $\alpha_c$ marks the onset of a transition to states with finite global polar order. For periodic boundaries, above $\alpha_c$, the system shows travelling waves that are completely ordered. In contrast, travelling waves are incompatible with Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries. Instead, for $\alpha \gtrsim \alpha_c$, we find fluctuating domains that show intermittent polar order and at large $\alpha$, the system partitions into two domains with opposite polar order.</description>

      <title>Adhesive forces in droplet kinetic friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic frictional forces resisting droplet motion often appear to be separate to surface wettability and adhesive forces. Here we show that such friction arises from a simple combination of the contact angle hysteresis and adhesive force. We show theoretically, and confirm using tilt angle experiments of droplets on liquid-like surfaces, the dependence of the coefficient of droplet-on-solid kinetic friction on system parameters. We also show that a molecular kinetic-type model can describe the observed non-linear velocity-force relationship. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the relationship between droplet-on-solid friction, and wettability and liquid adhesion.</description>

      <title>Atomic bonding in equilibrium single-component melts. The cases of arsenic, antimony and bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In liquid pnictogens, quasi-stable structures can be formed near melting temperature. The nature of their stability does not have the unified point of view. In the present work, the task of determining the degree of atomic bonding in these structures is solved using the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) method. The original results of ab-initio simulation of arsenic, antimony and bismuth melts near their melting temperatures are used. It is shown that the features of the electron interaction at the level of $p$-orbitals determine the characteristic bond lengths and angles between atoms. It has been established that the stability of structures decreases according to a power law with an increase in the atomic mass of a chemical element and the number of atoms in the structure. The obtained results clarify the understanding the mechanisms of formation of quasi-stable structures in pnictogen melts from first principles.</description>

      <title>Harvesting chemical power from cyclic environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Life relies on a sophisticated metabolic molecular machinery that turns over high-energy molecules to evolve complex macromolecules and assemblies. At the molecular origin of life, such machinery was absent, implying the need for simple yet robust physical mechanisms to harvest energy from the environment and perform chemical work or produce chemical power. However, the mechanisms involved in harvesting energy from a macroscopic cyclic environment to drive chemical processes on the molecular scale remain elusive. In this work, we propose a theory that describes the kinetics of chemical reactions in a system subject to a cyclic reservoir with varying properties. We compare cycles of solvent (wet-dry cycles), with cycles of a component participating in a chemical reaction (reactant cycle). We find that for both wet-dry and reactant cycles, resonance frequencies exist at which the chemical power is maximal. We identify which cycle type is more beneficial in harvesting chemical power for different molecular interactions. Our findings of harvest efficiencies around ten percent suggest that the cyclic environment could have played a key role in catalyzing the metabolic molecular machinery at the molecular origin of life.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Coulomb fissions of drops on lubricated surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged water drops are more widespread than commonly acknowledged. For example, raindrops typically carry charges of order Q ~ 1 pC, while routine pipetting in the laboratory produces drops with Q ~ 50 pC. Here, we show that such modest charging can spontaneously generate periodic Coulomb fissions for evaporating water drops on lubricated surfaces, with more than 60 successive cycles observed over 30 min. Interestingly, the underlying instability can be quantitatively predicted by two fissility thresholds: one marking the onset of drop elongation and another triggering fission. Each fission culminates with a fine liquid jet that disintegrates into 40-50 microdroplets, expelled within microseconds. The phenomenon spans an extraordinary range of length scales (from millimetres to microns) and time scales (hour to microseconds), with broad potential applications ranging from nanoscale fabrication to electrospray ionization.</description>

Here, it is shown that the shell will resist exactly three load cases and comply with the other three, provided the shell is simply connected, meaning it has no holes and no handles.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusion of sticky dendrimers in an associative polymer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the static and dynamic properties of dendrimers diffusing through a network of linear associative polymers using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations. Both dendrimers and network chains are modelled as bead-spring chain polymers, with hydrodynamic interactions incorporated for the accurate prediction of dynamic properties. Linear chains form a network via the associating groups distributed along their backbones, and the dendrimers interact attractively or repulsively with the network, enabling a direct comparison of sticky and non-sticky behaviour of dendrimers. Structural analysis reveals that while non-sticky dendrimers shrink with increasing network concentration, similar to linear polymer behaviour, sticky dendrimers exhibit stretching at low concentrations due to binding interactions. Dendrimer dynamics are largely insensitive to network architecture but are strongly influenced by the strength of dendrimer-network interactions. Increasing attraction to the network leads to subdiffusive motion and non-Gaussian displacement statistics, even when dendrimers are smaller than the average mesh size. The long-time diffusivity aligns with theoretical predictions for nanoparticle transport in polymer networks. Additionally, dendrimers deform the network locally, altering the mesh size distribution depending on their stickiness. These findings offer insight into the interplay between macromolecular architecture, binding interactions, and transport in polymeric environments.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and directed coalescence of condensates out of equilibrium</title>

Abstract: Phase separation into domains with distinct composition and properties has widespread implications, ranging from alloys and emulsions to biomolecular condensates in cells. In living and nonliving matter, the organization of these domains can be controlled by nonequilibrium chemical reactions, external fields, or mechanical stresses. In this context, stationary states can emerge from long-range monopolar interactions analogous to electrostatics. More generally, as discussed here, because fluxes induce dipolar force fields, externally controlled boundary motion effectively polarizes the domain even for microscopically nonpolarizable matter. The dipole-dipole interactions resulting from this translation-induced polarization cause directed coalescence of domains. This coarsening mechanism complements Ostwald ripening and coalescence due to Brownian motion or Marangoni flows, and has implications for controlling domains by electric fields or concentration gradients. Interestingly, the chemical potential gradients around a domain that nucleates material are exactly opposite to the hydrodynamic pressure gradients around an impermeable colloid that pushes the fluid, suggesting a competition between phase separation and hydrodynamics. In addition to chemical control, the motion of domains can also be driven by mechanical stresses. An example is the cell interior, where mechanical stresses are actively generated by molecular motors and opposed by passive viscoelastic stresses in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. The resulting fluid flows lead to Brownian motion with a suppressed or enhanced size scaling which modifies collision-coalescence. For active stresses with a long correlation time, the domains show superdiffusion on intermediate time scales. Together, these findings shed new light on the dynamics of domains in viscoelastic media and conserved order parameters in general.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Heterogeneity in Supercooled Water and its Spectroscopic Fingerprints</title>

Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.</description>

      <title>Mean-field model for the bubble size distribution in coarsening wet foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous foams are subject to coarsening, whereby gas from the bubbles diffuses through the liquid phase. Gas is preferentially transported from small to large bubbles, resulting in a gradual decrease of the number of bubbles and an increase in the average bubble size. Coarsening foams are expected to approach a scaling state at late times in which their statistical properties are invariant. However, a model predicting the experimentally observed bubble-size distribution in the scaling state of foams with moderate liquid content, as a function of the liquid fraction $\phi$, has not yet been developed. To this end, we propose a three-dimensional mean-field bubble growth law for foams without inter-bubble adhesion, validated against bubble-scale simulations, and use it to derive a prediction of the scaling-state bubble-size distribution for any $\phi$ from zero up to the unjamming transition $\phi_\text{c} \approx 36\%$. We verify that the derived scaling state is approached from a variety of initial conditions using mean-field simulations implementing the proposed growth law. Comparing our predicted bubble-size distribution with previous simulations and experimental results, we likewise find a large population of small bubbles when $\phi &gt; 0$, but there are qualitative differences from prior results which we attribute to the absence of rattlers, i.e. bubbles not pressed into contact with their neighbours, in our model.</description>

      <title>Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20287v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, current without density gradient, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a new transport effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-range colored noise. Active processes driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Elastohydrodynamics of 3D chemically active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength and nature of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with a computationally efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics. Through two illustrative examples, we conduct initial-value simulations that show that, as the stiffness of the filament is decreased, the dynamic behaviour moves from rigid motion to planar buckling, through an out-of-plane transition, eventually reaching diffusive-like behaviours for very deformable filaments.</description>
