      <title>Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength investigation of spiral structures in $z &gt; 1$ galaxies with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have revealed the prevalence of spiral structures at $z &gt; 1$. Unlike in the local Universe, the origin and the consequence of spirals at this epoch remain unexplored. We use public JWST/NIRCam data from the COSMOS-Web survey to map spiral structures in eight massive ($&gt; 10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies at $z_{\rm spec} \sim 1.5$. We present a method for systematically quantifying spiral arms at $z&gt;1$, enabling direct measurements of flux distributions. Using rest-frame near-IR images, we construct morphological models accurately tracing spiral arms. We detect offsets ($\sim 0.2 - 0.8\,\rm kpc$) between the rest-frame optical and near-IR flux distributions across most arms. Drawing parallels to the local Universe, we conclude that these offsets reflect the presence of density waves. For nine out of eighteen arms, the offsets indicate spiral shocks triggered by density waves. Five arms have offsets in the opposite direction and are likely associated with tidal interactions. For the remaining cases with no detected offsets, we suggest that stochastic 'clumpy' star formation is the primary driver of their formation. In conclusion, we find a multi-faceted nature of spiral arms at $z &gt; 1$, similar to that in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Clumps as multiscale structures in cosmic noon galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming clumps have been found to significantly influence the star formation of gas-rich $z&gt;1$ galaxies. Using public data from JWST/NIRCam (COSMOS-Web) and ALMA (FMOS-COSMOS), we study a sample of 32 massive ($&gt;10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) main-sequence galaxies at $z_{\rm spec}\sim1.5$ with $\sim0.3\,\rm kpc$ resolution. We create composite morphological models consisting of bulge, disk, and clumps to fully 'deconstruct' the galaxy images. With the resulting measurements of the flux and size of these components, we find the following: (I)The combined contribution of clumps is $1-30\%$ towards the net star formation rate (SFR) of the host while contributing $1-20\%$ to its stellar mass. The clumps show a correlation between their stellar mass and SFR, but have an increased specific-SFR (sSFR) relative to the star-forming main sequence, with offsets ranging from $0\lesssim\Delta\log\rm sSFR\lesssim 0.4$. They feature star formation surface densities of $10^{-2}-10^{2}\,\rm M_{\odot}/yr/kpc^{2}$, consistent with values observed in local star-forming and starburst galaxies. (II)The clumps span a large range of characteristic sizes ($r_{e}\sim0.1-1\,\rm kpc$) and stellar masses ($\sim 10^{8.0-9.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$). We estimate a mass-size relation ($r_{e}\propto\rm M_{\star}^{\,0.52\pm0.07}$) along with a stellar mass function (slope, $\alpha=-1.85\pm 0.19$), both suggesting a hierarchical nature similar to that expected in star-forming regions in local galaxies. (III)Our measurements agree with the properties of stellar clumps in $z\gtrsim1$ lensed systems, bridging the gap between lensed and unlensed studies by detecting structures at sub-kpc scales.(IV)Clumps are found to be preferentially located along spiral features visible primarily in the residual rest-frame near-IR images. In conclusion, we present an observation-based, coherent picture of star-forming clumps at $z&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>HST Observations within the Sphere of Influence of the Powerful Supermassive Black Hole in PKS0745-191</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of PKS0745-191, a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) undergoing powerful radio-mode AGN feedback ($P_{\rm cav}\sim5\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$). These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within a SMBHs sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, non-rotational ionized gas flows on sub-kpc scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive $M_{\rm BH}\sim1.5\times10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved. These results provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, highlighting the intricate relationship between SMBH fueling and AGN feedback within the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Recent star formation episodes in the Galaxy: impact on its chemical properties and the evolution of its abundance gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disc exploring various schemes of recent (last several Gyr) star formation episodes, as reported in recent observational works. We use a semi-analytical model with parametrized radial migration and we introduce gaussian star formation episodes constrained by those recent observations. We find significant impact of the star formation episodes on several observables, like the local age-metallicity and [alpha/Fe] vs metallicity relations, as well as the local stellar metallicity distribution or the existence of young [alpha/Fe]-rich stars. Moreover, we show that the recently found "wiggly" behaviour of the disk abundance gradient with age can be interpreted in terms of either star formation or infall episodes.</description>

      <title>Strong Lensing analysis of SPT-CLJ2325$-$4111 and SPT-CLJ0049$-$2440, two Powerful Cosmic Telescopes ($R_E &gt; 40''$) from the SPT Clusters Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results from a study of two massive ($M_{500c} &gt; 6.0 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) strong lensing clusters selected from the South Pole Telescope cluster survey for their high Einstein radius ($R_E &gt; 40''$), SPT-CLJ2325$-$4111 and SPT-CLJ0049$-$2440. Ground-based and shallow HST imaging indicated extensive strong lensing evidence in these fields, with giant arcs spanning 18\arcsec\ and 31\arcsec, respectively, motivating further space-based imaging followup. Here, we present multiband HST imaging and ground-based Magellan spectroscopy of the fields, from which we compile detailed strong lensing models. The lens models of SPT-CL\,J2325$-$4111 and SPT-CL\,J0049$-$2440 were optimized using 9, and 8 secure multiple-imaged systems with a final image-plane rms of 0\farcs63 and 0\farcs73, respectively. From the lensing analysis, we measure the projected mass density within 500~kpc of $M(&lt;500 ~{\rm kpc}) = 7.30\pm0.07 \times 10^{14}$$M_{\odot}$, and $M(&lt;500 ~{\rm kpc})=7.12^{+0.16}_{-0.19}\times 10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ for these two clusters, and a sub-halos mass ratio of $0.12\pm{0.01}$ and $0.21^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, respectively. Both clusters produce a large area with high magnification ($\mu\geq 3$) for a source at $z=9$, $A^{lens}_{| \mu | \geq 3 }=4.93^{+0.03}_{-0.04} arcmin^2$, and $A^{lens}_{| \mu | \geq 3 }=3.64^{+0.14}_{-0.10} arcmin^2$ respectively, placing them in the top tier of strong lensing clusters. We conclude that these clusters are spectacular sightlines for further observations that will reduce the systematic uncertainties due to cosmic variance. This paper provides the community with two additional well-calibrated cosmic telescopes, as strong as the Frontier Fields, suitable for studies of the highly magnified background Universe.</description>

      <title>The Quasar Feedback Survey: zooming into the origin of radio emission with e-MERLIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 6 GHz e-MERLIN observations of 42 $z&lt;0.2$ type 1 and type 2 mostly radio-quiet quasars ($L_{\rm[OIII]}\gtrsim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$; $L_{\rm AGN}\gtrsim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) from the Quasar Feedback Survey. The nature and origin of radio emission in these types of sources is typically ambiguous based on all-sky, low-resolution surveys. With e-MERLIN, we investigate radio emission on sub-kiloparsec scales ($\sim$10s-100s pc). We find 37/42 quasars are detected, with a diversity of radio morphologies, including compact cores, knots and extended jet-like structures, with sizes of 30-540 pc. Based on morphology and brightness temperature, we classify 76 per cent of the quasars as radio-AGN, compared to the $\sim$57 per cent identified as radio-AGN at the $\sim$1-60 kpc scales probed in prior studies. Combining results from e-MERLIN and the Very Large Array, 86 per cent reveal a radio-AGN. On average, $\sim$60 per cent of the total radio flux is resolved away in the e-MERLIN maps, and is likely dominated by jet-driven lobes and outflow-driven shocks. We find no significant differences in measured radio properties between type 1 and type 2 quasars, and estimate sub-relativistic jet speeds of $\sim$0.2-0.3c and modest jet powers of $P_\mathrm{jet} \approx \times$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the few targets, where these measurements were possible. These quasars share characteristics with compact radio-selected populations, and the global radio emission likely traces strong interactions between the AGN (jets/outflows) and their host galaxy ISM from 10s parsec to 10s kiloparsec scales.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration IV.: RR~Lyrae stars as traces of the Galactic bar -- 3D and 5D analysis, extinction variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We created new reddening maps and derived new extinction laws from visual to near-infrared passbands using improved RR~Lyrae period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations, thus enabling distance estimates for individual bulge RR~Lyrae variables. The extinction law is most uniform in RIK and RJK and the distances to individual RR~Lyrae based on these colors are determined with an accuracy six and four percent, respectively. Using only the near-infrared passbands for distance estimation we inferred the distance to the Galactic center equal to djk = 8.2 +- 0.001(stat) +- 0.53(sys)pc after geometrical correction. We show that variations in the extinction law toward the Galactic bulge can mimic a barred spatial distribution in the bulge RR~Lyrae star population in visual passbands. This arises from a gradient in extinction differences along Galactic longitudes and latitudes, which can create the perception of the Galactic bar, particularly when using visual passband-based distances. A barred angle in the RR~Lyrae spatial distribution disappears when near-infrared passband-based distances are used, as well as when reddening law variations are incorporated in visual passband-based distances. The prominence of the bar, as traced by RR~Lyrae stars, depends on their metallicity, with metal-poor RR~Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.0dex) showing little to no tilt with respect to the bar. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]&gt;-1.0dex) RR~Lyrae stars do show a barred/bulge signature in spatial properties derived using near-infrared distances, with an angle {\iota} = 18 +- 5deg, consistent with previous bar measurements from the literature. The 5D kinematic analysis, primarily based on transverse velocities, indicates a rotational lag in RR~Lyrae stars compared to red clump giants. Despite variations in the extinction law, our kinematic conclusions are robust across different distance estimation methods.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: Photometric Re-calibration with the BEst STar Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03513v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an independent validation and comprehensive re-calibration of S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS) DR1 12-band photometry using about 30,000--70,000 standard stars from the BEst STar (BEST) database. We identify spatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\,mmag for blue filters ($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the higher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration. Moreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic errors, up to 50\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field corrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the systematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial fitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The re-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within 6\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of re-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point precision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST DR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated USS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the milli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys. The re-calibrated USS DR1 photometry is publicly available: doi: 10.12149/101503 (https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101504/).</description>

      <title>Implications of the intriguing constant inner mass surface density observed in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known for long that the observed mass surface density of cored dark matter (DM) halos is approximately constant, independently of the galaxy mass (i.e., rhoc X rc simeq constant}, with rhoc and rc the central volume density and the radius of the core, respectively). Here we review the evidence supporting this empirical fact as well as its theoretical interpretation. It seems to be an emergent law resulting from the concentration-halo mass relation predicted by the current cosmological model, where the DM is made of collisionless cold DM particles (CDM). We argue that the prediction rhoc X rc simeq constant is not specific to this particular model of DM but holds for any other DM model (e.g., self-interacting) or process (e.g., stellar or AGN feedback) that redistributes the DM within halos conserving its CDM mass. In addition, the fact that rhoc X rc simeq constant is shown to allow the estimate of the core DM mass and baryon fraction from stellar photometry alone, particularly useful when the observationally-expensive conventional spectroscopic techniques are unfeasible.</description>

      <title>Jet properties of FR0 radio galaxies: need for VLBI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type 0 radio galaxies are a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) that lack extended kpc-scale jets, different from the classical FRI and FRII radio galaxies. They constitute the most abundant population of radio galaxies in the local Universe (z&lt;0.1), yet remain largely unexplored. VLBI observations of a limited number of FR0s demonstrated that their central supermassive black hole (SMBH) are able to lunch mostly two-sided jets, with mildly relativistic bulk speed. In this work, we highlight the need of further high-resolution radio observations to probe the jet structures of these compact radio galaxies, by showing exploratory results of our EVN+eMERLIN observation campaign of FR0s. A preliminary analysis of these recent data reveals a possible change of the jet direction at different scales.

      <title>ALMA chemical survey of disk-outflow sources in Taurus (ALMA-DOT) VII: the layered molecular outflow from HL Tau and its relationship with the ringed disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringed disk around HL Tau stands out as the iconic signature of planet formation, but the origin of the substructures is still debated. The HL Tau system also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost component traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with the disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO (2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and ~ 0.28" resolution, conducted within the ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a rich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and distance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the features generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction of the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence of distinct nested shells having higher velocity and faster acceleration going toward the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such configuration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we compare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three outermost shells are found to be at 55, 67 and 86 au from the star, coincident with regions of enhanced gas density in the disk. The wind may be capable of removing angular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of $\lambda \sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from these regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in nested shells with brighter emission rooted in rings of enhanced gas density could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according to which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a connected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected protoplanets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy with SPH simulations: II. AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate AGN feedback from an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, by performing isolated galaxy simulations using a modified version of the GADGET-3 code. We consider Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group as our simulation reference model. Beginning with black hole seeds ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, our simulations focus on comparing stellar-only feedback with AGN+stellar/SN feedback over 13.7 Gyr of galactic evolution. Our results indicate that a low-mass AGN in a dwarf galaxy influences the star formation history under specific physical conditions. While AGN feedback is generally negative on star formation, instances of positive feedback were also identified. Despite measurable effects on the evolution of the dwarf host galaxy, black hole seeds exhibited only marginal growth. We tested several physical scenarios as modified models in our simulations, primarily concerning the dynamics of the central black holes, which may wander within dwarf galaxies rather than being centrally located. However, none of these adjustments significantly impacted the growth of the black hole seeds. This suggests that intermediate-mass black holes may struggle to achieve higher masses in isolated environments, with mergers and interactions likely playing crucial roles in their growth. Nevertheless, AGN feedback exhibited non-negligible effects in our simulated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, despite the assumed dominant role of stellar feedback in the low-mass regime.</description>

      <title>Polarization Profiles of Globular Cluster Pulsars from FAST I. 25 Profiles from Previously Known Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar polarization profiles are critical for understanding their magnetospheric structures and radiation mechanisms. We present polarization profile measurements for 25 pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) from the observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The diversity of polarization profiles shows complex magnetic structure and emission pattern of pulsars. Among these, the polarization profiles of 15 pulsars were firstly measured. M53A present a 57\% linear polarization ratio, being highest among these 25 GC pulsars. M15H present a 42\% circular polarization ratio, which is the highest among these 25 pulsars. The average ratios of circular and absolute circular polarization of these GC pulsars are -1\% and 10\% respectively, lower than normal pulsars measured with Parkes (\citealt{Oswald2023}), which are 5\% and 32\%, respectively. The Rotation Measure (RM) values of each pulsar were measured, giving the range of pulsar(s) from M3, M5, M15, M71, M53, NGC6517, NGC6539, NGC6760 being 8(1) to 16(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -1(2) to -4(6) rad $m^{-2}$, -70(2) to -76(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -480(14) rad $m^{-2}$ (M71A only), -2(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (M53A only), 187(1) to 212(2) rad $m^{-2}$, 109(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (NGC6539A only), and 102(1) to 129(4) rad $m^{-2}$. The GCs closer to the Galactic plane (GP) tend to have larger RM. This is consistent with previous study (\citealt{Hutschenreuter2022}).</description>

      <title>Twinkle: A GPU-based binary-lens microlensing code with contour integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing rate of microlensing planet detections, microlensing modeling software faces significant challenges in computation efficiency. Here, we develop the Twinkle code, an efficient and robust binary-lens modeling software suite optimized for heterogeneous computing devices, especially GPUs. Existing microlensing codes have the issue of catastrophic cancellation that undermines the numerical stability and precision, and Twinkle resolves them by refining the coefficients of the binary-lens equation. We also devise an improved method for robustly identifying ghost images, thereby enhancing computational reliability. We have advanced the state of the art by optimizing Twinkle specifically for heterogeneous computing devices by taking into account the unique task and cache memory dispatching patterns of GPUs, while the compatibility with the traditional computing architectures of CPUs is still maintained. Twinkle has demonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (&gt;~100 times) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle will translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis for ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects. Both GPU and CPU versions of Twinkle are open-source and publicly available.</description>

      <title>The fragmentation of molecular clouds in starburst environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant amount of star formation occurs and has occurred in environments unlike the solar neighbourhood. The majority of stars formed closer to the peak of the cosmic star formation rate (z &gt; 1.3) and a great deal of star formation presently occurs in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. These environments are unified by the presence of a high interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a high cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR). Numerical studies of stellar birth typically neglect this fact, and those that do not have thus far been limited in scope. In this work we present the first comprehensive analysis of hydrodynamical simulations of star formation in extreme environments where we have increased the ISRF and CRIR to values typical of the CMZ and starburst galaxies. We note changes in the fragmentation behaviour on both the core and stellar system scale, leading to top-heavy core and stellar system mass functions in high ISRF/CRIR clouds. Clouds fragment less on the core scale, producing fewer but more massive cores. Conversely, the cores fragment more intensely and produce richer clusters of stellar systems. We present a picture where high ISRF/CRIR clouds fragment less on the scale of cores and clumps, but more on the scale of stellar systems. The change in fragmentation behaviour subsequently changes the mass function of the stellar systems that form through enhanced accretion rates.</description>

      <title>The properties of GSN 069 accretion disk from a joint X-ray and UV spectral analysis: stress-testing quasi-periodic eruption models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and XMM-Newton data of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069. Using ultraviolet (UV) and optical images at HST resolution, we show that GSN 069's emission consists of a point source superimposed on a diffuse stellar component. The latter accounts for $\leq 5\%$ of the UV emission in the inner 0.5"$\times$0.5" region, while the luminosity of the former cannot be attributed to stars. Analyzing the 2014/2018 HST UV spectra, we show that to leading order the intrinsic spectral shape is $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{4/3}$, with $\sim 10\%$ far UV flux variability between epochs. The contemporaneous X-ray and UV spectra can be modeled self-consistently in a thin disk framework. At observed epochs, the disk had an outer radius ($R_{\rm out}$) of $\mathcal{O}(10^3 R_{\rm g})$, and shows both cooling and expansion over the four years. Incorporating relativistic effects via numerical ray tracing, we constrain the disk inclination angle ($i$) to be $30^\circ \lesssim i \lesssim 65^\circ $ and identify a narrow region of spin-inclination parameter space that describes the observations. These findings confirm that GSN 069 hosts a compact, viscously expanding accretion disk likely formed after a TDE. Implications for QPE models are: (i) No published disk instability model can explain the disk's stability in 2014 (no QPEs) and its instability in 2018 (QPEs present); (ii) While the disk size in 2018 allows for orbiter/disk interactions to produce QPEs, in 2014 the disk was already sufficiently extended, yet no QPEs were present. These findings pose challenges to existing QPE models.</description>

      <title>Empirical Modeling of Magnetic Braking in Millisecond Pulsars to Measure the Local Dark Matter Density and Effects of Orbiting Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method that enables us to estimate the acceleration of individual millisecond pulsars (MSPs) using only their spin period and its time derivative. For our binary MSP sample, we show that one can obtain an empirical calibration of the magnetic braking term that relies only on observed quantities. We find that such a model for magnetic braking is only valid for MSPs with small surface magnetic field strengths ($&lt;3\times10^8$ G) and large characteristic ages ($&gt;$ 5 Gyr). With this method we are able to effectively double the number of pulsars with line-of-sight acceleration measurements, from 28 to 54 sources. This expanded dataset leads to an updated measurement of the total density in the midplane, which we find to be $\rho_0$ = 0.086 $\pm$ 0.001 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$, and an updated measurement of the local dark matter density, which we calculate to be $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ = 0.014 $\pm$ 0.005 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ (0.53 $\pm$ 0.30 GeV/cm$^3$). This updated value for $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ is in good agreement with literature values derived from kinematic estimates. We show that each new acceleration measurement improves the precision of $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ by the same amount as roughly 10$^5$ stars. The pulsar accelerations are very asymmetric above and below the disk; we show that the shape and size of this asymmetry can be largely explained by the north-south asymmetry of disk star counts and the offset in the Milky Way disk and halo centers of mass due to the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Binary Systems on Microlensing Using SPISEA and PopSyCLE Population Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing provides a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of stars, black holes, and other objects in the Milky Way. Population simulations are necessary to interpret results from microlensing surveys. The contribution from binary objects is often neglected or minimized in analysis of observations and simulations despite the high percentage of binary systems and microlensing's ability to probe binaries. To simulate the population effects we added multiple systems to Stellar Population Interface for Stellar Evolution and Atmospheres (SPISEA), which simulates stellar clusters. We then inject these multiples into Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE), which simulates Milky Way microlensing surveys. When making OGLE observational selection criteria, we find that 55% of observed microlensing events involve a binary system. Specifically, 14.5% of events have a multiple-lens and a single source, 31.7% have a single lens and a multiple-source, and 8.8% have a multiple-lens and a multiple-source. The majority of these events have photometric lightcurves that appear single and are fit well by a single-lens, single-source model. This suggests that binary source and binary lens-binary source models should be included more frequently in event analysis. The mean Einstein crossing time shifts from 19.1 days for single events only to 21.3 days for singles and multiple events, after cutting binary events with multiple peaks. The Einstein crossing time distribution of singles and single-peaked multiple events is better aligned with observed distributions from OGLE (arXiv:1707.07634) than singles alone, indicating that multiple systems are a significant missing piece between simulations and reality.</description>

      <title>High Resolution {\it BOES} Spectroscopy of Raman-scattered He~II$\lambda$6545 in Young Planetary Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young planetary nebulae (PNe) are characterized by their hot central stars and the presence of abundant neutral and molecular components, which result from significant mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of stellar evolution. Far-UV \ion{He}{2}$\lambda$1025 line photons produced near the central star can undergo Raman scattering by hydrogen atoms, creating a broad emission feature centered at $\sim$ 6545~\AA. We conducted high-resolution spectroscopy of 12 young PNe from April 2019 to March 2020 using the Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph ({\it BOES}). Building on the study by Choi and Lee, who identified Raman-scattered \ion{He}{2} at 6545~\AA\ in NGC~6881 and NGC~6886, we report new detections of this feature in NGC~6741 and NGC~6884. Profile fitting reveals that the velocity of the \ion{H}{1} component relative to the \ion{He}{2} emission region ranges from $26-33~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in these PNe. Using photoionization modeling, we estimate the line flux of \ion{He}{2}$\lambda$1025 and derive Raman conversion efficiencies of 0.39, 0.21, 0.24, and 0.07 for NGC~6881, NGC~6741, NGC~6886, and NGC~6884, respectively. These results, combined with radiative transfer modeling, suggest the presence of \ion{H}{1} components with masses around $10^{-2}~M_\odot$, moving outward from the central \ion{He}{2} emission region at speeds characteristic of the slow stellar wind from a mass-losing giant star.</description>

      <title>Exploring membership and variability in NGC 7419: An open cluster rich in super giants and Be type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 7419 is a young open cluster notable for hosting five Red Supergiants and a much higher abundance of Classical Be stars (CBe) than typical open clusters. We perform a membership analysis using GAIA DR3 data and machine learning techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Random Forest (RF) and determine the cluster's mean distance to be 3.6 $\pm$ 0.7 kpc. We identify 499 GAIA-based members with a mass above $\sim$ 1.5 M$\odot$, and estimate the cluster's age to be $21.1 ^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$ Myr. Using our revised $H\alpha$ excess-based analysis, we find 42 CBe stars containing many known CBe stars, bringing the total number of CBe stars in NGC 7419 to 49 and the fraction of CBe to (B+CBe) members to 12.2 %. We investigate the variability of the candidate members from ZTF and NEOWISE data using standard deviation, median absolute deviation, and Stetson Index (J), and their periodicity using the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram variability. We find that 66 % of CBe stars are variable: 23 % show periodic signals from pulsation or rotation, 41 \% exhibit variability from disk dynamics or binarity, and 14 % have long-term variations due to disk dissipation/formation. We also find that all pulsating CBe stars are early-type, while 50 \% of stars with long-term variations are early-type, and the other 50 % are mid-type. Our results agree with previous findings in the literature and confirm that CBe stars display variability through multiple mechanisms across different timescales.</description>

      <title>High-cadence stellar variability studies of RR Lyrae stars with DECam: New multi-band templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the most extensive set to date of high-quality RR Lyrae light curve templates in the griz bands, based on time-series observations of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) East field, located in the Galactic bulge at coordinates (RA, DEC)(J2000) = (18:03:34, -29:32:02), obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Our templates, which cover both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, can be especially useful when there is insufficient data for accurately calculating the average magnitudes and colors, hence distances, as well as to inform multi-band light curve classifiers, as will be required in the case of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In this paper, we describe in detail the procedures that were adopted in producing these templates, including a novel approach to account for the presence of outliers in photometry. Our final sample comprises 136 RRab and 144 RRc templates, all of which are publicly available. Lastly, in this paper we study the inferred Fourier parameters and other light curve descriptors, including rise time,skewness, and kurtosis, as well as their correlations with the pulsation mode, period, and effective wavelength.</description>

      <title>Eruptive YSOs in Cygnus-X: a mid-infrared variability study with NEOWISE and SPICY</title>

Abstract: The mass accretion process controls pre-main-sequence evolution, although its intrinsic instability has yet to be fully understood, especially towards the protostellar stage. In this work, we have undertaken a thorough examination of the mid-infrared variability of Spitzer-selected YSOs in the Cygnus-X star-forming region over the last decade, using the NEOWISE time series. This work compares two groups of young stars: embedded Class I objects, and the more evolved flat-spectrum/Class II sources. We report on 48 candidate eruptive variables within these groups, including 14 with characteristics that resemble the photometric behaviour of FUors. We also include an additional 20 YSOs, which are of a less certain categorisation. We find the candidate FUors to be an order of magnitude more common among the younger Class I systems than more evolved objects. A large number of the identified short-duration eruptive YSOs display mid-infrared colour behaviour that is redder-when-brighter, which contrasts with optically bright outbursts seen in YSOs. Finally, we note the unusual long-term rising behaviours of four Class I YSOs, with rise timescales longer than five years, which is far slower than 6-12 month timescale for the majority of optically discovered FUors. Additionally, our broader investigation of MIR variability for embedded class I YSOs shows that there is a higher incidence of high amplitude variability for these stars, than is seen in class II sources. This holds true for all variable class I YSOs, not just the eruptive sources.</description>

      <title>Do Unusually Cold Starburst Galaxies Exist? A Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of CO($J$=9$\to$8) and OH$^+$($N$=1$\to$0) toward the four millimeter-selected lensed starburst galaxies SPT 2354-58, 0150-59, 0314-44, and 0452-50, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Compact Array (ALMA/ACA), as part of a larger study of OH$^+$ in the early universe. In this work, we use these observations for the main purpose of spectroscopic redshift measurements. For all sources except SPT 0452-50, we confirm the previously reported most likely redshifts, and we find typical CO and OH$^+$ properties for massive starbursts. For SPT 0452-50, we rule out the previously reported value of $z$=2.0105, measuring a firm redshift of $z$=5.0160 based on [OI], [CII], H$_2$O, and CO emission instead when adding in ancillary ALMA data. Previously, SPT 0452-50 was considered an outlier in relations between dust temperature, far-infrared luminosity and redshift, which may have hinted at an unusually cold starburst with a dust temperature of only $T_{\rm dust}$=(21$\pm$2) K. Instead, our new measurements suggest it to be among highly luminous massive dusty starbursts at $z$$&gt;$5, with rather typical properties within that population. We find a revised dust temperature of $T_{\rm dust}$=(76.2$\pm$2.5) K, and an updated lensing-corrected far-infrared luminosity (42.5-122.5 $\mu$m) of (2.35$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$)$\times$10$^{13}$ $L_\odot$ - i.e., about an order of magnitude higher than previously reported. We thus do not find evidence for the existence of unusually cold starburst galaxies in the early universe that were missed by previous selection techniques.</description>

      <title>AGN energetics and lifetimes from remnant radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy coupling efficiency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts is known to {vary} significantly with factors including the jet kinetic power, duration of the outburst, and properties of the host galaxy group or cluster. As such, constraints on their jet power and lifetime functions are crucial to quantify the role of kinetic-mode AGN feedback on the evolution of galaxies since $z \sim 1$. In this work, we address this issue by measuring the energetics of a sample of 79~low-redshift (0.02 $&lt; z &lt;$ 0.2) remnant radio galaxies compiled from large-sky radio surveys - remnants uniquely probe the full duration of an AGN outburst. The jet kinetic power and outburst duration of each remnant are determined using the RAiSE dynamical model based on the surface brightness distribution observed in multi-frequency radio images. We compare the energetics constrained for this sample to those predicted for mock radio source populations - with various intrinsic functions for jet power and lifetime distributions - to correct for sample selection biases imposed on our sample. The intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions that yield a selection-biased mock population most similar to our observed sample are determined using Bayesian inference. Our analysis places robust constraints on assumed power-law indices for the intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions: $p(Q)\propto Q^{-1.49\pm0.07}$ and $p(t_{\mathrm{on}})\propto t_{\mathrm{on}}^{-0.97\pm0.12}$ respectively. We discuss the implications of these findings for feedback-regulated accretion and the self-regulating nature of jet activity. The methodology proposed in this work can be extended to active radio galaxies in future studies.</description>

      <title>Resolving turbulence drivers in two luminous obscured quasars with JWST/NIRSpec IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we investigate the turbulence and energy injection in the extended nebulae surrounding two luminous obscured quasars, WISEA J100211.29$+$013706.7 ($z=1.5933$) and SDSS J165202.64$+$172852.3 ($z=2.9489$). Utilizing high-resolution data from the NIRSpec IFU onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, we analyze the velocity fields of line-emitting gas in and around these quasars and construct the second-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) to quantify turbulent motions across different spatial scales. Our findings reveal a notable flattening in the VSFs from $\approx\!3$ kpc up to a scale of 10--20 kpc, suggesting that energy injection predominantly occurs at a scale $\lesssim$10 kpc, likely powered by quasar outflows and jet-driven bubbles. The extended spatial range of flat VSFs may also indicate the presence of multiple energy injection sources at these scales. For J1652, the turbulent energy in the host interstellar medium (ISM) is significantly higher than in tidally stripped gas, consistent with the expectation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activities stirring up the host ISM. Compared to the VSFs observed on spatial scales of 10--50 kpc around lower-redshift UV-bright quasars, these obscured quasars exhibit higher turbulent energies in their immediate surroundings, implying different turbulence drivers between the ISM and halo-scale gas. Future studies with an expanded sample are essential to elucidate further the extent and the pivotal role of AGNs in shaping the gas kinematics of host galaxies and beyond.</description>

      <title>ALMA 0.1 pc View of Molecular Clouds Associated with High-Mass Protostellar Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud: Are Low-Metallicity Clouds Filamentary or Not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filamentary molecular clouds are an essential intermediate stage in the star formation process. To test whether these structures are universal throughout cosmic star formation history, it is crucial to study low-metallicity environments within the Local Group. We present an ALMA analysis of the ALMA archival data at the spatial resolution of $\sim$0.1 pc for 17 massive young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; Z $\sim$0.2 $Z_{\odot}$). This sample represents approximately 30% of the YSOs confirmed by Spitzer spectroscopy. Early ALMA studies of the SMC have shown that the CO emission line traces an H$_2$ number density of $\gtrsim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, an order of magnitude higher than in the typical Galactic environments. Using the CO($J$ = 3-2) data, we investigated the spatial and velocity distribution of molecular clouds. Our analysis shows that about 60% of the clouds have steep radial profiles from the spine of the elongated structures, while the remaining clouds have a smooth distribution and are characterized by lower brightness temperatures. We categorized the former as filaments and the latter as non-filaments. Some of the filamentary clouds are associated with YSOs with outflows and exhibit higher temperatures, likely reflecting their formation conditions, suggesting that these clouds are younger than non-filamentary ones. This indicates that even if filaments form during star formation, their steep structures may become less prominent and transit to a lower-temperature state. Such transitions in structure and temperature have not been reported in metal-rich regions, highlighting a key behavior for characterizing the evolution of the interstellar medium and star formation in low-metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>The size of accretion disks from self-consistent X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry fitting: applications to ASASSN-14li and HLX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius ($R_{\rm out}$) as a free parameter, integrating it into standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data ($\Delta t \approx 350-1300$ days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. We show that at these late-times the multi-wavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) of $7^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$, consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations; and an $R_{\rm out}$ of $45 \pm 13 \, R_{\rm g}$, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations on the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate HLX-1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX-1, we find $M_{\rm BH} = 4^{+3}_{-1} \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm out} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{3} \, R_{\rm g}$, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination ($i$) of HLX-1 to be $10^o \leq i \leq 70^o$.</description>

      <title>Stars or gas? Constraining the hardening processes of massive black-hole binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive black-hole binaries will be the loudest sources detectable by LISA. These systems are predicted to form during the hierarchical assembly of cosmic structures and coalesce by interacting with the surrounding environment. The hardening phase of their orbit is driven by either stars or gas and encodes distinctive features into the binary black holes that can potentially be reconstructed with gravitational-wave observations. We present a Bayesian framework to assess the likelihood of massive mergers being hardened by either gaseous or stellar interactions. We use state-of-the-art astrophysical models tracking the cosmological evolution of massive black-hole binaries and construct a large number of simulated catalogs of sources detectable by LISA. From these, we select a representative catalog and run both parameter estimation assuming a realistic LISA response as well model comparison capturing selection effects. Our results suggest that, at least within the context of the adopted models, future LISA observations can confidently constrain whether stars or gas are responsible for the binary hardening. We stress that accurate astrophysical modeling of the black-hole spins and the inclusion of subdominant emission modes in the adopted signal might be crucial to avoid systematic biases.</description>

      <title>The Disk Wind Contribution to the Gamma-Ray emission from the nearby Seyfert Galaxy GRS 1734-292</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies have been detected in GeV gamma-rays by the $Fermi$ Large Area Telescope (LAT), but the origin of much of this emission is unclear. We consider the nearby example, the Seyfert galaxy GRS 1734-292, which exhibits weak starburst and jet activities that are insufficient to explain the observed gamma-ray flux. With the first detailed multi-wavelength study of this source, we demonstrate that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk wind can account for its gamma-ray emission. Using a lepto-hadronic emission model based on a shocked ambient medium and a shocked wind region created by an AGN accretion disk wind, we identify two viable scenarios that are consistent with the $Fermi$-LAT data and multi-wavelength observations: a hadronic $pp$-dominated scenario and a leptonic external Compton-dominated scenario. Both of these show that future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) could detect TeV emission from a disk wind in GRS 1734-292. Such a detection would substantially improve our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration efficiency in AGN disk wind systems, and would establish radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies as cosmic ray accelerators capable of reaching ultra-high energies.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>
