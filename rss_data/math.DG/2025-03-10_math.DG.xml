      <description>arXiv:2503.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that smooth polarized Fano fibrations have no nontrivial finite covers. Using results by Sun-Zhang and Wylie, it follows that shrinking K\"ahler-Ricci solitons are simply-connected.</description>

      <title>Ricci flow from singular spaces with bounded curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of a solution to the Ricci flow with a compact length space of bounded curvature, i.e., a space that has curvature bounded above and below in the sense of Alexandrov, as its initial condition. We show that this flow converges in the $C^{1,\alpha}$-sense to a $C^{1,\alpha}$-continuous Riemannian manifold which is isometric to the original metric space. Moreover, we prove that the flow is uniquely determined by the initial condition, up to isometry.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds with flat Euclidean conformal infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a rigidity theorem for Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds whose conformal infinity is a flat Euclidean space. The proof relies on analyzing the propagation of curvature tensors over the level sets of an adapted boundary defining function. Additionally, we provide examples of Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds with non-compact conformal infinities. Furthermore, we draw analogies with Ricci-flat manifolds exhibiting Euclidean volume growth, particularly when the compactified metric has non-negative scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>A Hadamard theorem in transversely affine geometry with applications to affine orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a novel notion of transversely affine foliation, comparing and contrasting it to the previous ones in the literature. We then use it to give an extension of the classic Hadamard's theorem from Riemannian geometry to this setting. Our main result is a transversely affine version of a well-known "Hadamard-like" theorem by J. Hebda for Riemannian foliations. Alternatively, our result can be viewed as a foliation-theoretic analogue of the Hadamard's theorem for affine manifolds proven by Beem and Parker. Namely, we show that under the transverse analogs of pseudoconvexity and disprisonment for the family of geodesics in the transverse affine geometry, together with an absence of transverse conjugate points, the universal cover of a manifold endowed with a transversely affine foliation whose leaves are compact and with finite holonomy is diffeomorphic to the product of a contractible manifold with the universal cover of a leaf. This also leads to a Beem-Parker-type Hadamard-like theorem for affine orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete Asymptotic Behaviours of the J-function of a Fano Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a condition on the coefficients of a cohomology-valued power series, which we call ``asymptotically Mittag-Leffler''. We show that if the $J$-function of a Fano manifold is asymptotically Mittag-Leffler, then it has the exponential growth as $t\to +\infty$. This provides an alternative method to compute the principal asymptotic class of a Fano manifold using the coefficients of $J$-function. We also verify that the $J$-function of the projective space is asymptotically Mittag-Leffler, and the property of having an asymptotically Mittag-Leffler $J$-function is preserved when taking product and hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Vanishing theorems for Hodge numbers and the Calabi curvature operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a compact $n$-dimensional K\"ahler manifold with $\frac{n}{2}$-positive Calabi curvature operator has the rational cohomology of complex projective space. For even $n,$ this is sharp in the sense that the complex quadric with its symmetric metric has $\frac{n}{2}$-nonnegative Calabi curvature operator, yet $b_n =2.$ Furthermore, the compact K\"ahler manifolds with $\frac{n}{2}$-nonnegative Calabi curvature operator are completely classified. In addition, the previously known results for the K\"ahler curvature operator are improved when the metric is K\"ahler-Einstein.</description>

Abstract: We prove a splitting theorem for a smooth noncompact manifold with (possibly noncompact) boundary. We show that if a noncompact manifold of dimension $n\geq 2$ has $\lambda_1(-\alpha\Delta+\operatorname{Ric})\geq 0$ for some $\alpha&lt;\frac{4}{n-1}$ and mean-convex boundary, then it is either isometric to $\Sigma\times \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ for a closed manifold $\Sigma$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature or it has no interior ends.</description>

Abstract: We consider a compact submanifold $M$ of a Riemannian manifold $N$ and we use the second variation formula as a tool to drive some geometric results on reach$(M, N)$ the reach of $M$ in $N$, including some useful relations between the extrinsic geometry of $M$ in $N$ and reach$(M, N)$. Our results generalize some theorems previously proved for the special case where $N$ is Euclidean space.</description>

Abstract: We consider the classical geometric problem of prescribing the scalar and the boundary mean curvature in the unit ball endowed with the standard Euclidean metric. We will deal with the case of negative scalar curvature showing the existence of infinitely many non-radial positive solutions when the dimension is larger or equal to 5. This is the first result of existence of solutions in the case of negative prescribed scalar curvature problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Outer billiards in the complex hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a quadratically convex compact connected oriented hypersurface $N$ of the complex hyperbolic plane, we prove that the characteristic rays of the symplectic form restricted to $N$ determine a double geodesic foliation of the exterior $U$ of $N$. This induces an outer billiard map $B$ on $U$. We prove that $B$ is a diffeomorphism (notice that weaker notions of strict convexity may allow the billiard map to be well-defined and invertible, but not smooth) and moreover, a symplectomorphism. These results generalize known geometric properties of the outer billiard maps in the hyperbolic plane and complex Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, H.\,Brezis published a list of his ``favorite open problems", which he described as challenges he had ``raised throughout his career and has resisted so far". We provide a complete resolution to the first one--Open Problem 1.1--in Brezis's favorite open problems list: the existence of solutions to the long-standing Brezis-Nirenberg problem on a three-dimensional ball. Furthermore, using the building blocks of Del Pino-Musso-Pacard-Pistoia sign-changing solutions to the Yamabe problem, we establish the existence of infinitely many sign-changing, nonradial solutions for the full range of the parameter.</description>

      <title>Tangent Currents, King's Residue Formula and Intersection Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the intersection of positive closed currents on domains. We use the theory of tangent currents in connection with King's residue formula. We find a sufficient condition for the local existence of tangent currents, and express the shadow of tangent currents and the $h$-dimension of tangent currents in terms of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere type current. Further, a reasonable integrability condition for the existence of the unique tangent current with minimal $h$-dimension is introduced. We apply it to the study of the intersection of positive closed currents, find a sufficient condition for the intersection of positive closed currents on domains and describe the intersection in terms of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere type current. At the same time, we obtain regularizations of positive closed currents that work well with the suggested intersection of positive closed currents. In particular, the standard regularization of currents by convolution actually produces the convergence towards the intersection of positive closed currents. In this sense, our approach generalizes King's work on currents defined by analytic varieties, which is obtained from Federer's slicing theory. Some classical examples are computed. Our work is applicable to general complex manifolds not necessarily compact or K\"ahler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that a function on an open set in $\mathbb R^d$ is smooth if and only if it is arc-smooth, i.e., its composites with all smooth curves are smooth. In recent work, we extended this and related results (for instance, a real analytic version) to suitable closed sets, notably, sets with H\"older boundary and fat subanalytic sets satisfying a necessary topological condition. In this paper, we prove that the resulting set-theoretic identities of function spaces are bornological isomorphisms with respect to their natural locally convex topologies. Extending the results to maps with values in convenient vector spaces, we obtain corresponding exponential laws. Additionally, we show analogous results for special ultradifferentiable Braun-Meise-Taylor classes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the fundamental theorem for submanifolds to general ambient spaces by viewing it as a higher codimensional Cartan-Ambrose-Hicks theorem. The key ingredient in obtaining this is a generalization of development of curves in the positive codimensional case. One advantage of our results is that it also provide a geometric construction of the isometric immersion when the isometric immersion exists.</description>

      <title>Examples of biquotients whose tangent bundle is not a biquotient vector bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A biquotient vector bundle is any vector bundle over a biquotient $G/\!\!/ H$ of the form $G\times_{H} V$ for an $H$-representation $V$. Over most biquotients, biquotient vector bundles are the only vector bundles known to admit metrics of non-negative sectional curvature, and hence they play a crucial role in the context of the converse to the Soul Theorem of Cheeger and Gromoll. In this article, we study the question of when the tangent bundle of $G/\!\!/ H$ is a biquotient vector bundle. We find infinite families of examples of biquotients $M\cong G/\!\!/ H$ for which the tangent bundle is not a biquotient vector bundle for any presentation of $M$ as a biquotient. In addition, we find infinite families of manifolds which arise as biquotients in two ways: one for which the tangent bundle is a biquotient bundle, and one for which it is not. Some of these results depend on an observation of Hirzebruch which relates the signature and Euler characteristic of an almost complex manifold. We include a proof of this fact as it seems to be missing from the literature.</description>

      <title>Stationary curves under the M\"obius-Plateau energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plateau problems with elastic boundary energies have been of recent theoretical and applied interest. However, strong assumptions have to be made to avoid self-intersections of the boundary curve during energy minimization. We introduce a class of Plateau problems for boundaries with self-repulsive energies that obviates self-contact in energy minimization problems. For the self-repulsive energy, we choose the M\"obius Energy introduced by O'Hara due to its myriad regularity properties shown by Freedman et al. We first prove an existence theorem for this M\"obius-Plateau problem in the class of closed Lipschitz curves of a given irreducible knot-type spanned by immersed discs. We then turn our attention to M\"obius-Plateau variations of helicoidal strips, which are classified as "screw-like" or "ribbon-like" based on the signs of the radii of the boundary helices. By analyzing the Euler-Lagrange equations, we show that screw-like solutions are plentiful, whilst ribbon-like solutions impose strong constraints on their parameters: they must have high frequency (equivalently, low pitch), thin width in comparison to the frequency, and remain close to the axis.</description>

      <title>On weak and strict relatives K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study K\"ahler manifolds that are (weak) relatives, that is, K\"ahler manifolds which share a (locally isometric) submanifold. In particular, we prove that if two K\"ahler manifolds are weak relatives and one of them is projective, then they are relatives. Moreover, we introduce the notion of strict relatives K\"ahler manifolds and provide several nontrivial examples.</description>

      <title>Maximality and Cauchy developments of Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article suggests the definition of 'Lorentzian space' weakening the notion of Lorentzian length space just as much that it allows for a functor from the category of causally continuous Lorentzian manifolds to the corresponding category of Lorentzian spaces, and considers three problems in the context of maximal Cauchy developments of Lorentzian length spaces (LLSs): The first is to define pointed Gromov-Hausdorff metrics for spatially and temporally noncompact LLSs, the second to present an explicit non-spacetime example of a maximal vacuum Cauchy development in the LLS category, the third to define canonical representatives for developments. A certain regularity property for geodesics plays a key role in each of the problems.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers and Fano fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we build connections between K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers, i.e., complete (possibly non-compact) shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci solitons, and algebraic geometry. In particular, we (1). prove that a K\"ahler-Ricci shrinker is naturally a quasi-projective variety, using birational algebraic geometry; (2). formulate a conjecture relating the existence of K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers and K-stability of polarized Fano fibrations, which unifies and extends the YTD type conjectures for K\"ahler-Einstein metrics, Ricci-flat K\"ahler cone metrics and compact K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers; (3). formulate conjectures connecting tangent flows at singularities of K\"ahler-Ricci flows and algebraic geometry, via a 2-step degeneration for the weighted volume of a Fano fibration.</description>

      <title>Positive biorthogonal curvature on \(S^2 \times T^2\) via metrically compatible connection with nonzero torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the long-standing open problem of the existence of a Riemannian metric on \(S^2\times T^2\) with strictly positive biorthogonal curvature. The original problem is limited to the Levi-Civita connection, so it still remains open as this study addresses the stated problem in a broader context. Our result shows that \(S^2\times T^2\) admits a metrically compatible connection with non-zero torsion, such that the strictly positive biorthogonal curvature condition can be satisfied.</description>

Abstract: We construct a generalization of the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum for suitable three-manifolds $Y$ with $b_1(Y)&gt;0$. For a cobordism between three-manifolds we define Bauer-Furuta maps on these new spectra, and additionally compute some examples.</description>

      <title>Outer billiards in the spaces of oriented geodesics of the three dimensional space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.01679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M_{\kappa }$ be the three-dimensional space form of constant curvature $\kappa =0,1,-1$, that is, Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the sphere $S^{3} $, or hyperbolic space $H^{3}$. Let $S$ be a smooth, closed, strictly convex surface in $M_{\kappa }$. We define an outer billiard map $B$ on the four dimensional space $\mathcal{G}_{\kappa }$ of oriented complete geodesics of $M_{\kappa }$, for which the billiard table is the subset of $\mathcal{G}_{\kappa }$ consisting of all oriented geodesics not intersecting $S$. We show that $B$ is a diffeomorphism when $S$ is quadratically convex.
  For $\kappa =1,-1$, $\mathcal{G}_{\kappa }$ has a K\"{a}hler structure associated with the Killing form of $\operatorname{Iso}(M_{\kappa })$. We prove that $B$ is a symplectomorphism with respect to its fundamental form and that $B$ can be obtained as an analogue to the construction of Tabachnikov of the outer billiard in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ defined in terms of the standard symplectic structure. We show that $B$ does not preserve the fundamental symplectic form on $\mathcal{G}_{\kappa }$ associated with the cross product on $M_{\kappa }$, for $\kappa =0,1,-1$.
  We initiate the dynamical study of this outer billiard in the hyperbolic case by introducing and discussing a notion of holonomy for periodic points.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Catenoid for the Hyperbolic Vanishing Mean Curvature Equation Outside Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of stability of the catenoid, which is an asymptotically flat rotationally symmetric minimal surface in Euclidean space, viewed as a stationary solution to the hyperbolic vanishing mean curvature equation in Minkowski space. The latter is a quasilinear wave equation that constitutes the hyperbolic counterpart of the minimal surface equation in Euclidean space. Our main result is the nonlinear asymptotic stability, modulo suitable translation and boost (i.e., modulation), of the $n$-dimensional catenoid with respect to a codimension one set of initial data perturbations without any symmetry assumptions, for $n \geq 5$. The modulation and the codimension one restriction on the data are necessary and optimal in view of the kernel and the unique simple eigenvalue, respectively, of the stability operator of the catenoid.
  In a broader context, this paper fits in the long tradition of studies of soliton stability problems. From this viewpoint, our aim here is to tackle some new issues that arise due to the quasilinear nature of the underlying hyperbolic equation. Ideas introduced in this paper include a new profile construction and modulation analysis to track the evolution of the translation and boost parameters of the stationary solution, a new scheme for proving integrated local energy decay for the perturbation in the quasilinear and modulation-theoretic context, and an adaptation of the vectorfield method in the presence of dynamic translations and boosts of the stationary solution.</description>
