      <title>Superlinear free-discontinuity models: relaxation and phase field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the Direct Method in the Calculus of Variations for free-discontinuity energies whose bulk and surface densities exhibit superlinear growth, respectively for large gradients and small jump amplitudes. A distinctive feature of this kind of models is that the functionals are defined on $SBV$ functions whose jump sets may have infinite measure. Establishing general lower semicontinuity and relaxation results in this setting requires new analytical techniques. In addition, we propose a variational approximation of certain superlinear energies via phase field models.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis for one-dimensional charge transfer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-dimensional linear Schr\"odinger equations with multiple moving potentials, known as transfer charge models. Focusing on the non-self-adjoint setting that arises in the study of solitons, we systematically develop the scattering theory and establish dispersive estimates under the assumption that the potentials move at significantly different velocities, even in the presence of unstable modes. In particular, we prove the existence of wave operators, asymptotic completeness, and pointwise decay of solutions, without requiring the absence of threshold resonances. Our analysis set up the fundamental work for studying the nonlinear dynamics of multi-solitons, including asymptotic stability and collisions.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation on Zoll manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain optimal space-time estimates in $L^q_{t,x}$ spaces for all $q\ge 2$ for solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation on Zoll manifolds, including, in particular, the standard round sphere $S^d$. The proof relies on the arithmetic properties of the spectrum of the Laplacian on Zoll manifolds, as well as bilinear oscillatory integral estimates, which allow us to relate the problem to Strichartz estimate on one-dimensional tori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove Liouville type theorem for the double Beltrami solutions to the stationary Hall-MHD equations in $\Bbb R^3$. Let $(u, B)$ be a smooth double Beltrami solution to the stationary Hall-MHD equations in $\Bbb R^3$, satisfying $\int_{\Bbb R^3} (|u|^q + |B|^q )dx &lt;+\infty$ for some $q\in [2, 3)$, then $u=B=0$. In the case of $B=0$ the theorem reduces the previously known Liouville type result for the Beltrami solutions to the Euler equations.</description>

      <title>A regularity theory for evolution equations with space-time anisotropic non-local operators in mixed-norm Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the regularity of solutions to inhomogeneous time-fractional evolution equations involving anisotropic non-local operators in mixed-norm Sobolev spaces of variable order, with non-trivial initial conditions. The primary focus is on space-time non-local equations where the spatial operator is the infinitesimal generator of a vector of independent subordinate Brownian motions, making it the sum of subdimensional non-local operators. A representative example of such an operator is $(\Delta_{x})^{\beta_{1}/2}+(\Delta_{y})^{\beta_{2}/2}$. We establish existence, uniqueness, and precise estimates for solutions in corresponding Sobolev spaces. Due to singularities arising in the Fourier transforms of our operators, traditional methods involving Fourier analysis are not directly applicable. Instead, we employ a probabilistic approach to derive solution estimates. Additionally, we identify the optimal initial data space using generalized real interpolation theory.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness in the near isotropic Lp dual Minkowski problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For n&gt;1 and -1&lt;p&lt;1, we prove that if q is close to n and the qth Lp dual curvature is Holder close to be the constant one function, then this "near isotropic" qth Lp dual Minkowski problem on the (n-1)-dimensional sphere has a unique solution. Along the way, we establish a C0 estimate for -1&lt;p&lt;1 that is optimal in the sense that if p&lt;-1 and q=n, then it is known that the analogous C0 estimate does not hold. We also prove the uniqueness of the solution of the near isotropic even qth Lp dual Minkowski problem on the (n-1)-dimensional sphere if -1&lt;p&lt;q&lt;min{n,n+p} and q&gt;0.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Hartree NLS in 3d coming from a Many-Body Quantum System with White Noise Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the defocusing Hartree NLS with white noise external potential on T^3 i.e. the Hartree NLS whose linear part is given by the Anderson Hamiltonian. A Strichartz-type estimate is established for the Anderson Hamiltonian using perturbative arguments and the local and global well-posedness of the NLS is considered with initial data in the domain and form-domain of the Anderson Hamiltonian under different regularity assumptions on the Hartree interaction. Furthermore, we establish the Anderson Hartree NLS as an effective equation describing many-body Bosonic systems and, in particular, we prove the convergence of the linear Schr\"odinger equation for the many body system to the BBGKY hierarchy for the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Almost Global Solutions of Kirchhoff Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the original Kirchhoff equation $$\left\{\begin{aligned}
  &amp; \pa_{tt}u-\Big(1+\int_{0}^{\pi}|\pa_xu|^2 dx\Big)\pa_{xx}u=0,
  \\&amp;u(t,0)=u(t,\pi)=0. \end{aligned}\right.$$ We obtain almost global existence and stability of solutions for almost any small initial data of size $\varepsilon$. In Sobolev spaces, the time of existence and stability is of order $\varepsilon^{-r}$ for arbitrary positive integer $r$. In Gevrey and analytic spaces, the time is of order $e^{\frac{|\ln\varepsilon|^2}{c\ln|\ln\varepsilon|}}$ with some positive constant $c$. To achieve these, we build rational normal form for infinite dimensional reversible vector fields without external parameters. We emphasize that for vector fields, the homological equation and the definition of rational normal form are significantly different from those for Hamiltonian functions.</description>

      <title>The DC Kerr Effect in Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use weakly nonlinear geometric optics to study a model for the DC Kerr effect (the Kerr electro-optic effect), in which a light beam propagating through a material with strong nonlinear optical properties can have its polarization rotated by applying a strong external electric field. This effect is used to build fast switches (Kerr cells). We prove existence of an exact solution of the nonlinear Maxwell system with a cubic Kerr nonlinearity, with the wavelength $h$ being a small parameter. We justify the effect within this model, and also solve the inverse problem of recovery of the nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$ from the change of the polarization.</description>

      <title>Curvature estimates for hypersurfaces of constant curvature in hyperbolic space II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the existence of smooth complete hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space with constant curvature and a prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity. By deriving curvature estimates, we are able to deduce the existence in some cases. Previously, these existence results were proved for a restricted range of curvature values, while here we prove the existence for all possible curvature values.</description>

      <title>On recovering intragranular strain fields from grain-averaged strains obtained by high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address an unusual problem in the theory of elasticity motivated by the problem of reconstructing the strain field from partial information obtained using X-ray diffraction. Referred to as either high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy~(HEDM) or three-dimensional X-ray diffraction microscopy~(3DXRD), these methods provide diffraction images that, once processed, commonly yield detailed grain structure of polycrystalline materials, as well as grain-averaged elastic strains. However, it is desirable to have the entire (point-wise) strain field. So we address the question of recovering the entire strain field from grain-averaged values in an elastic polycrystalline material. The key idea is that grain-averaged strains must be the result of a solution to the equations of elasticity and the overall imposed loads. In this light, the recovery problem becomes the following: find the boundary traction distribution that induces the measured grain-averaged strains under the equations of elasticity. We show that there are either zero or infinite solutions to this problem, and more specifically, that there exist an infinite number of kernel fields, or non-trivial solutions to the equations of elasticity that have zero overall boundary loads and zero grain-averaged strains. We define a best-approximate reconstruction to address this non-uniqueness. We then show that, consistent with Saint-Venant's principle, in experimentally relevant cylindrical specimens, the uncertainty due to non-uniqueness in recovered strain fields decays exponentially with distance from the ends of the interrogated volume. Thus, one can obtain useful information despite the non-uniqueness. We apply these results to a numerical example and experimental observations on a transparent aluminum oxynitride (AlON) sample.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Consistency Models: Fast Generation with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistency models have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional SDE based diffusion models, offering a significant acceleration in generation by producing high quality samples in very few steps. Despite their empirical success, a proper theoretic justification for their speed up is still lacking. In this work, we provide the analysis which bridges this gap, showing that given a consistency model which can map the input at a given time to arbitrary timestamps along the reverse trajectory, one can achieve KL divergence of order $ O(\varepsilon^2) $ using only $ O\left(\log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $ iterations with constant step size, where d is the data dimension. Additionally, under minimal assumptions on the data distribution an increasingly common setting in recent diffusion model analyses we show that a similar KL convergence guarantee can be obtained, with the number of steps scaling as $ O\left(d \log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $. Going further, we also provide a theoretical analysis for estimation of such consistency models, concluding that accurate learning is feasible using small discretization steps, both in smooth and non smooth settings. Notably, our results for the non smooth case yield best in class convergence rates compared to existing SDE or ODE based analyses under minimal assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a unique continuation property for solutions of the differential inequality $|\nabla u|\leq V|u|$, where $V$ is locally $L^n$ integrable on a domain in $\mathbb R^n$. A stronger uniqueness result is obtained if in addition the solutions are locally Lipschitz. One application is a finite order vanishing property in the $L^2$ sense for the exponential of $W^{1,n}$ functions. We further discuss related results for the Cauchy-Riemann operator $\bar\partial$ and characterize the vanishing order for smooth extension of holomorphic functions across the boundary.</description>

Abstract: We consider a free boundary problem for the heat equation with a given non-negative external heat source. On the free boundary, we impose the zero Dirichlet condition and the fixed normal derivative so that heat escapes from the boundary. In various settings, we show that there exist no solutions when the initial temperature equals the fixed temperature no matter where the initial location of the free boundary is given provided that the external heat source is bounded from above. We also note that there is a chance to have a solution when the external temperature is unbounded as time tends to zero by giving a self-similar solution.</description>

      <title>Ground states for the NLS on non-compact graphs with an attractive potential</title>

Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on non-compact quantum graphs with an attractive potential supported in the compact core, and investigate the existence and the nonexistence of Ground States, defined as minimizers of the energy at fixed $L^2$-norm, or mass. We finally reach the following picture: for small and large mass there are Ground States. Moreover, according to the metric features of the compact core of the graph and to the strength of the potential, there may be an interval of intermediate masses for which there are no Ground States. The study was inspired by the research on quantum waveguides, in which the curvature of a thin tube induces an effective attractive potential.</description>

      <title>Transformation of Stochastic Recursions and Critical Phenomena in the Analysis of the Aldous-Shields-Athreya Cascade and Related Mean Flow Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper has two main goals. First, we extend the contemporary probability theory on trees to investigate critical phenomena in a stochastic model of Yule type called Aldous-Shields-Athreya (ASA) cascade. Second, we apply the newly developed probabilistic framework to problems of uniqueness and nonuniqueness of solutions to the linear and nonlinear mean flow equations, referred to as the pantograph equation and $\alpha$-Riccati equation, respectively. The stochastic processes associated with these equations are related to each other via a one-parameter family of transformations. Remarkably, these simple transformations lead to infinitely many solutions to the initial-value problem of the nonlinear mean flow equation. Despite being non-explicit at the level of mean flow, their effect on the mean flow equations is reminiscent of how the Cole-Hopf transformation maps solutions of the heat equation to those of the Burgers equation. While the ASA cascade has been used to model percolation, ageing, and data compression, its relevance to any specific physical molecular dynamics is unclear to the authors. Nevertheless, our results highlight how simple stochastic-level transformations can uncover significant macroscopic structures. This principle is exemplified by the connection between spontaneous magnetization and shocks in the Burgers equation (Newman 1986) or the connection between the branching Brownian motion and the KPP equation (McKean 1975). In our model, the breakdown of uniqueness in mean flow solutions corresponds to critical phenomena in the ASA cascade such as stochastic explosion, hyperexplosion, and percolation.</description>

      <title>On a generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equation on closed almost K\"ahler surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a generalized Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation on closed almost K\"ahler surfaces, where the equation depends only on the underlying almost K\"ahler structure. As an application, we prove Donaldson's conjecture for tamed almost complex 4-manifolds.</description>
