      <title>Structural transition and emission enhancement in vacancy ordered halide double perovskite Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of pressure on the structural evolution, enhancement of photoluminescence intensity and optical band gap of a vacancy ordered double halide perovskite Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ is investigated systematically. We use synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, optical band gap and photoluminescence measurements to explore the structural and the optical properties of Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ under pressure up to 30.0 GPa. We find that Cs$_2$TeCl$_6$ undergoes a structural transition from cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m to monoclinic P2$_1$/n at very low pressure below 1.0 GPa. A significant increase in photoluminescence intensity and a rapid decrease in optical band gap are observed, which are related to the octahedral distortion and structural transition. Interestingly, with increasing pressure, the sample regains its ambient Fm$\bar{3}$m structure at around 3.4 GPa maintaining the cubic phase up to 30.0 GPa. The sample undergoes an iso-structural transition at around 14.1 GPa pressure with a slight decrease in compressibility.</description>

      <title>Mangnon-Phonon-Photon Interactions in Cubic Ferromagnets in the Vicinity of Orientational Phase Transition: Retrospective and Phenomenological Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of magnon-phonon-photon interactions in cubic ferromagnets near orientational phase transitions (OPT). The study focuses on the interplay of magnetoelastic (ME), electromagnetic-spin (EMS), and acousticelectromagnetic (AEM) interactions in ferromagnetic dielectrics and metals. By deriving dispersion equations for coupled waves, the research reveals how the dynamic properties of magnetically ordered crystals evolve in response to these interactions under varying external magnetic fields and near OPT points. The ME interaction prominently influences spin and elastic wave dynamics, giving rise to coupled modes such as quasimagnon and quasi-acoustic waves. Near the OPT, these interactions become dominant, leading to phenomena like the magnetoelastic gap and softening of vibrational modes. The EMS interaction significantly alters the activation energy and dispersion of quasi-spin and quasi-electromagnetic waves. In ferromagnetic metals, helicons (weakly damped electromagnetic waves) exhibit strong coupling with spin and elastic waves, particularly in the OPT region. The study identifies conditions for triple resonance among spin, elastic, and electromagnetic waves. Additionally, it explores the frequency-dependent rotation of polarization planes in electromagnetic and magnetoelastic waves, which sharpens near OPT points. These results provide a deeper understanding of the coupled dynamics in ferromagnetic materials, paving the way for new technological applications in spintronics, signal processing, and advanced magneto-optical devices. The theoretical framework developed here emphasizes the critical role of ME, EMS, and AEM interactions in tailoring wave properties for specific applications, particularly in designing next-generation magnetic and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>
