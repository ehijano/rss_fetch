      <title>Gaussian fluctuations for the nonlinear stochastic heat equation with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the Quantitative Central Limit Theorem (QCLT) for the spatial average of the solution of the nonlinear stochastic heat equation with constant initial condition, driven by space-time Gaussian white noise in dimension 1. The novelty is that the equation contains a drift term. We assume that the drift and diffusion coefficients are twice differentiable with bounded first and second order derivatives. For the proof, we use Malliavin calculus, and the second-order Poincar\'e inequality due to Vidotto (2020). To estimate the moment of the second Malliavin derivative of the solution, we develop a novel estimate for the product of two heat kernels, which is of independent interest. Finally, we provide the functional result corresponding to this CLT.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous percolation phase transition on the hierarchical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$ with translation-invariant edge kernel $J$, it is a classical theorem of Aizenman and Newman (1986) that the phase transition is discontinuous when $J(x,y)$ is of order $|x-y|^{-2}$ and that there is no phase transition at all when $J(x,y)=o(|x-y|^{-2})$. We prove a strengthened version of this theorem for the hierarchical lattice, where the relevant threshold is at $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ rather than $|x-y|^{-2}$: There is a continuous phase transition for kernels of larger order, a discontinuous phase transition for kernels of exactly this order, and no phase transition at all for kernels of smaller order. As such, $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ is essentially the \emph{only} kernel that produces a discontinuous phase transition. We also prove a hierarchical analogue of the ``$M^2\beta=1$'' conjecture of Imbrie and Newman (1988), which gives an exact formula for the density of the infinite cluster at the point of discontinuous phase transition and remains open in the Euclidean setting.</description>

      <title>Sharp inequalities for symmetric polynomials, Hunter's conjecture, and moments of exponential random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Hunter's conjecture on complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. For even $n$ and every integer $k\geq 1$, we show that under the constraint $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2=1$ the global minimum of the even-degree polynomial $h_{2k}(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ is attained precisely at the half-plus/half-minus vector and we compute the optimal value in closed form. The proof combines algebraic properties of $h_{2k}$ with the probabilistic representation $k!\,h_k(a)=\mathbb{E}(\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i)^k$, where $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are i.i.d. standard exponential random variables with density $e^{-x}1_{x&gt;0}$ and a combinatorial identity. This viewpoint further yields sharp upper and lower bounds for $\mathbb{E}|\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i|^{q}$ under natural constraints on the coefficients, including the spherical constraint $\sum a_i^2=1$ combined with the non-negative regime $a_i\ge0$, or the centred regime $\sum a_i=0$. Moreover, we determine the exact minimum of $h_{2k}$ on the $\ell_\infty$-sphere $S_\infty = \{a \in \mathbb{R}^n : \|a\|_\infty = 1\}$, which yields sharp norm comparison inequalities between the matrix norms induced by complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials and the classical operator and Schatten norms.</description>

      <title>On a Roll Again: Analysis of a Dice Removal Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we have $n$ dice, each with $s$ faces (assume $s\geq n$). On the first turn, roll all of them, and remove from play those that rolled an $n$. Roll all of the remaining dice. In general, if at a certain turn you are left with $k$ dice, roll all of them and remove from play those that rolled a $k$. The game ends when you are left with no dice to roll. For $n,s \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $s \geq n$, let $Y_n^s$ be the random variable for the number of turns to finish the game rolling $n$ dice with $s$ faces. We find recursive and non-recursive solutions for $\mathbb{E}(Y_n^{s})$ and $\mathrm{Var}(Y_n^{s})$, and bounds for both values. We conclude that the expected value grows linearly in both the number of dice and the number of faces, while the standard deviation grows linearly in the number of faces. Moreover, we show that $Y_n^{s}$ can also be modeled as the maximum of a sequence of i.i.d. geometrically distributed random variables. Although, as far as we know, this game hasn't been studied before, similar problems have.</description>

      <title>Precise Deviations for the Ewens-Pitman Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an integral representation for the distribution of the number of types $K_n$ in the Ewens-Pitman model. Based on this representation, we also establish precise large deviations and precise moderate deviations for $K_n$. After careful examination, we find that the rate function exhibits a second-order phase transition and the critical point is $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits in dependent random environments: relating a random walk, a branching process and a spatial branching process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend existing connections between random walks, branching processes, and spatial branching processes, and their respective scaling limits, to include processes in dependent random environments. More specifically, we prove new scaling limits of a random walk in a dependent random environment, an associated branching process in a dependent random environment, and a spatial branching process in a dependent random environment. We show that the scaling limits are related in ways reminiscent of existing results in fixed environments. A Ray-Knight Theorem relates the scaling limits of the random walk in the random environment and the branching process in the random environment. The Brownian snake relates the scaling limit of the spatial branching process in the random environment to the scaling limit of the random walk in the random environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider some further generalizations of the novel random graph models as introduced by Bandyopadhyay and Sen \cite{BaSe2025} and find asymptotic for the degree of a fixed vertex and along with the asymptotic degree distribution. We show that in the \emph{case of the inverse power law} the order of these statistics is much slower than the case of the simple inverse function, which was considered in \cite{BaSe2025}. However, the results for the linear case remain exactly the same even after introducing a "shift" parameter.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the extremal eigenvalues of Ginibre ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish large deviation principles for the extremal eigenvalues of the Ginibre ensembles with good rate functions. In contrast to the typical estimates for the extremal eigenvalues, the large deviations for the real Ginibre ensemble come from the eigenvalues lying on the real line. Moreover, we also derive deviation estimates for the second leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the extremal eigenvalues. These polynomially small deviation estimates are universal for any i.i.d. matrices under a mild moment condition.</description>

      <title>Eigen, singular, cosine-sine, and Autonne--Takagi vectors distributions of random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that some of the best-known matrix decompositions of some of the best-known random matrix ensembles give us the unique $G$-invariant uniform distributions on some of the best-known manifolds. The eigenvectors distributions of the Gaussian, Laguerre, and Jacobi ensembles are all given by the uniform distribution on the complete flag manifold. The singular vectors distributions of Ginibre ensembles are given by the uniform distribution on a product of the complete flag manifold with a Stiefel manifold. Circular ensembles split into two types: The cosine-sine vectors distributions of circular real, unitary, and quaternionic ensembles are given by the uniform distributions on products of a (partial) flag manifold with copies of the orthogonal, unitary, or compact symplectic groups. The Autonne--Takagi vectors distributions of circular orthogonal, Lagrangian, and symplectic ensembles are given by the uniform distributions on Lagrangian Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Optimal design for the planar Skorokhod embedding problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the planar Skorokhod embedding problem introduced by Gross and developed further by Boudabra-Markowsky, and we place it in a fully variational framework. For a centered probability measure $\mu$ with finite second moment, we show that Gross' $\mu$ -domain $U_{\mu}^{G}$ uniquely minimizes the area among all simply connected $\mu$ -domains. Equivalently, $U_{\mu}^{G}$ minimizes a natural $H^{\frac{1}{2}}$-type boundary energy, providing an optimal design interpretation of the planar Skorokhod embedding problem. The proof relies on the Fourier characterization of fractional Sobolev spaces on the circle, symmetric decreasing rearrangement of the quantile of $\mu$ , and a one-dimensional fractional $P\'olya-Szeg\H{o}$ inequality. Within the Schlicht class, we obtain a sharp model case: under a natural normalization of the quantile, the Gross area is uniquely minimized by the shifted arcsine distribution. This identifies the Gross domain of the arcsine law as the extremal Schlicht solution to the planar Skorokhod embedding problem. In the second part of the paper we return to Brownian symmetrization. Using the optimality of $U_{\mu}^{G}$, we prove that Brownian symmetrization is area-nonincreasing and, in fact, dominates Steiner symmetrization in this regard. We then quantify the ratio $$\rho(U):=\frac{\mathcal{A}(U_{\mu}^{G})}{\mathcal{A}(U)},$$showing that, among simply connected domains of fixed area, every value in $(0,1]$ is attained. A family of thin rectangles provides a striking example where the associated one-dimensional laws collapse to a Dirac mass in $L^{2}$ while the Gross domain does not shrink, illustrating the genuinely fractional nature of the underlying $H^{\frac{1}{2}}$-geometry. Altogether, our results clarify the geometric content of the planar Skorokhod embedding and open a systematic program of "optimal design" via Brownian symmetrization.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for the Dean--Kawasaki Equation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions: Taming the Square-Root</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the ergodicity of generalized Dean--Kawasaki equations with correlated noise and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In contrast to the ergodicity results of Fehrman, Gess, and Gvalani arXiv:2206.14789, our analysis accommodates irregular, square-root type noise coefficients. For such irregular coefficients, we prove that the law of the classical Dean--Kawasaki equation converges exponentially fast to equilibrium, while for the porous medium type Dean--Kawasaki equation, the convergence occurs at a polynomial rate. Furthermore, we obtain a regularization by noise effect, showing that the polynomial convergence rate improves to an exponential one whenever the noise coefficient is sufficiently regular, including the case of conservative multiplicative linear noise. Our approach relies on establishing a supercontraction property in a suitably weighted Lebesgue space, achieved through a refined doubling of variables argument. The construction of the weight function crucially exploits the specific structure of the Dean--Kawasaki-type correlated noise.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides the time-dependent $L^2$-martingale representation of the forward stochastic integral where the driving noise is the Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with parameter $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt; 1$ and the integrand is a square-integrable adapted process. As a by-product, we obtain the exact $L^2$-isometry of the forward stochastic integrals based on suitable conditions on time-dependent martingale representations of adapted integrands combined with the Nelson's stochastic derivative of the underlying Gaussian driving noise.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium fluctuations for the stirring process with births and deaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional stirring process on the segment $\{-N,\ldots,N\}$, coupled to boundary dynamics that inject particles from the right reservoir and remove particles from the left reservoir, each acting on a window of size $K$. We investigate the non-equilibrium fluctuations of the system, starting from a product measure associated with a smooth initial profile. Given our initial state, the fluctuations are given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose characteristic operators are the Laplacian and gradient operators. The domains of these operators include functions with boundary conditions that depend on the hydrodynamic profile. A central ingredient in our analysis is the derivation of sharp bounds on the space and space-time $v$-functions of arbitrary degree for the centered occupation variables. In particular, we prove that the $v$-functions of degree $2$ and $3$ are of order $N^{-1}$, while those of degree at least $4$ are of order $N^{-1-\zeta}$ for some $\zeta &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality of Subgraph Counts in Sparse Inhomogeneous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the number of copies of a fixed graph $H$ in a random graph $G_n$ sampled from a sparse graphon model. Specifically, we provide a refined analysis that separates the contributions of edge randomness and vertex-label randomness, allowing us to identify distinct sparsity regimes in which each component dominates or both contribute jointly to the fluctuations. As a result, we establish asymptotic normality for the count of any fixed graph $H$ in $G_n$ across the entire range of sparsity (above the containment threshold for $H$ in $G_n$). These results provide a complete description of subgraph count fluctuations in sparse inhomogeneous networks, closing several gaps in the existing literature that were limited to specific motifs or suboptimal sparsity assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Regime-Switching Approach to the Unbalanced Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unbalanced Schr\"odinger bridge problem (uSBP) seeks to interpolate between a probability measure $\rho_0$ and a sub-probability measure $\rho_T$ while minimizing KL divergence to a reference measure $\mathbf{R}$ on a path space. In this work, we investigate the case where $\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a diffusion process with killing, which we interpret as a regime-switching diffusion. In addition to matching the initial and terminal distributions of trajectories that survive up to time $T$, we consider a general constraint $\psi(t,x)$ on the distribution of killing times and/or killing locations.
  We investigate the uSBPs corresponding to four choices of $\psi$ in detail which reflect different levels of information available to an observer. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the connections and the comparisons among the outcomes of these four cases. Our results are novel in the field of uSBP. The regime-switching approach proposed in this work provides a unified framework for tackling different uSBP scenarios, which not only reconciles but also extends the existing literature on uSBP.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for Markov processes in bounded sets with jump kernels decaying at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12991</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we study two types of purely discontinuous symmetric Markov processes $X$ in bounded smooth subsets of $\mathbb R^d$: conservative processes and processes killed either upon approaching the boundary of the set or by a killing potential $\kappa$. The jump kernel of $X$ is of the form $J(x,y)={\cal B}(x,y)|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$, where the function ${\cal B}(x,y)$ decays to 0 at the boundary and is described in terms of two $O$-regularly varying functions and one slowly varying function. Under the conditions, introduced in \cite{CKSV24}, on ${\cal B}(x,y)$ and on the killing potential $\kappa$, we establish sharp two-sided estimates on the heat kernel of $X$: in Lipschitz sets when $X$ is conservative, and in $C^{1,1}$ open sets for the killed process.</description>

      <title>From CKLS Process to CIR-type and OU-type Processes: Using a Twice-differentiable Mapping and Generalized Girsanov's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a twice-differentiable transformation applied to a CKLS-type short-rate model with linear drift and power-type diffusion. The transformation yields a new process whose diffusion component has a square-root structure and whose drift becomes nonlinear. A critical reassessment of earlier studies using similar transformations reveals fundamental errors in model specification and derivations. To address this, we introduce a generalized Girsanov change of measure that adjusts the drift of the transformed process. Under the resulting equivalent measure, the dynamics reduce to the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. Using the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem, we establish existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, and show that the combined transformation and measure change is valid only under specific parameter restrictions, including those most relevant for financial applications. The CIR representation allows us to exploit known results on stationary distributions, moments, and boundary behavior. Under an additional coefficient relationship, the process can be further linked to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework, yielding explicit distributional properties under the equivalent measure. Finally, since standard martingale conditions are not applicable, we prove directly that the associated Radon-Nikodym derivative is a true martingale by invoking a recent criterion based on Feller's explosion test and boundary classification.</description>

      <title>Group-averaged Markov chains II: tuning of group action in finite state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study group-averaged Markov chains obtained by augmenting a $\pi$-stationary transition kernel $P$ with a group action on the state space via orbit kernels. Given a group $\mathcal{G}$ with orbits $(\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$, we analyse three canonical orbit kernels: namely the Gibbs $(G)$, Metropolis-Hastings $(M)$, and Barker $(B)$ kernels, as well as their multiplicative sandwiches $QPQ$ and the additive mixtures $\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$ where $Q\in\{G,M,B\}$. We show that $M^t, B^t \to G$ blockwise as $t \to \infty$ under suitable conditions, that the projection chains induced by $(\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$ coincide for $GPG$ and $P$, and that orbit averaging never deteriorates the absolute spectral gap or asymptotic variance when $P$ is reversible. We give a direct and simple proof of Pythagorean identity under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, showing that $GPG$ arises naturally as an information projection of $P$ onto the set of $G$-invariant transition matrices. For a given $P$, we characterise the optimal choice of $G$ with a fixed number of orbits that minimises the one-step KL divergence to stationarity. Analogously, for a given $G$, we characterise the optimal choice of $P$ and give sufficient conditions under which $GPG = \Pi$. We further show that alternating projections over multiple group actions converge at a rate governed by the singular values of an overlap matrix, and that in structured cases, this yields exact sampling where the number of group actions grows logarithmically with the size of the state space. Based on the theory, we propose two heuristics to tune $G$ in practice. We also illustrate the results on discrete uniform and multimodal examples, including the Curie-Weiss model where $GPG$ achieves polynomial (in inverse temperature and dimension) mixing while Glauber dynamics remains exponentially slow.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for non-linear functionals of Gaussian fields via Wiener chaos decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review and present some known results for non-linear functionals of Gaussian variables in the context of discrete Gaussian fields defined on the $d$ dimensional lattice. Our main result is a Central Limit Theorem in the spirit of the classical Breuer-Major theorem, together with applications to the powers of the Gaussian Free Field. Notably, we show that even powers of the discrete Gaussian Free Field converge to the Gaussian white noise, while odd powers converge to a continuous Gaussian Free Field with explicit covariance. The proofs are based on the Wiener chaos decomposition and the fourth moment theorem (Nualart-Peccati, 2005), and include a tightness result. Even if these tools are well-known in the literature, their application to Gaussian fields on the lattice appears to be new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a renewal process which models a cumulative shock model that fails when the accumulation of shocks up-crosses a certain threshold. The ratio limit properties of the probabilities of non-failure after n cumulative shocks are studied. We establish that the ratio of survival probabilities converges to the probability that the renewal epoch equals zero. This limit holds for any renewal process, subject only to mild regularity conditions on the individual shock random variable. Precisions on the rates of convergence are provided depending on the support structure and the regularity of the distribution. Arguments are provided to highlight the coherence between this new results and the pre-existing results on the behavior of summands of i.i.d. real random variables.</description>

      <title>Martingales On A Euclidean Manifold With A Boundary And Reflected BSDES In Non-Convex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the notion of a $\Gamma$-martingale on a Euclidean manifold with a boundary (i.e., the closure of an open connected domain in R d ), we provide its equivalent characterization through the $\Gamma$-convex functions, and we establish its connection with the reflected backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in the associated domain. Second, we show how the tools of stochastic geometry can be used to develop a new method for proving existence and uniqueness of solutions to reflected BSDEs. We implement this method and obtain a well-posedness result for reflected BSDEs in any bounded, two-dimensional, simply-connected domain that is locally C2 -diffeomorphic to a convex set. This work extends the results of [6] and [16].</description>

      <title>A few observations around Gaussian domination and continuous symmetry breaking for spin O(N) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of Gaussian domination for the spin $O(N)$ model on general finite graphs. We begin by proving a general inequality for spin correlations under the assumption of Gaussian domination, which directly implies long-range order at low temperatures for graphs with bounded Green's function. Usually, Gaussian domination is proved via reflection positivity, but this requires strict symmetries and is very rigid. In this article we also probe the boundaries of elementary methods for proving Gaussian domination. Although we did not find a way to get uniform bounds, we do offer new views for Gaussian domination at low and high temperatures for finite graphs, and a few counterexamples illustrating the interplay between correlation estimates and Gaussian domination and how local changes in the graph structure can affect the presence of Gaussian domination.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for sticky SDEs with local times and applications to stochastic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general convergence theorem for solutions of multivariate stochastic differential equations with countably many singular terms expressed as integrals with respect to local times. The processes under consideration describe diffusions in the presence of semipermeable hyperplane interfaces. These interfaces may become sticky after applying a random time change that depends on the amount of local time accumulated on each interface.
  We show that, as the distance between the interfaces tends to zero, the local-time terms converge to a limiting homogenized drift term. When the interfaces are sticky, the limiting diffusion also decelerates, meaning that its diffusion coefficient is effectively reduced.
  Such limit theorems illustrate a form of stochastic homogenization for diffusions evolving in a heterogeneous medium interleaved with semipermeable, sticky interfaces.</description>

      <title>Measuring Asymptotic Convergence: A Unified Framework from Isotropic Infinity to Anisotropic Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point \omega_A to the space A and define convergence a \to \omega_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts.</description>

      <title>On the epsilon-delta Structure Underlying Chatterjee's Rank Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an epsilon-delta interpretation of Chatterjee's rank correlation by tracing its origin to a notion of local dependence between random variables. Starting from a primitive epsilon-delta construction, we show that rank-based dependence measures arise naturally as epsilon to zero limits of local averaging procedures. Within this framework, Chatterjee's rank correlation admits a transparent interpretation as an empirical realization of a local L1 residual.
  We emphasize that the probability integral transform plays no structural role in the underlying epsilon-delta mechanism, and is introduced only as a normalization step that renders the final expression distribution-free. We further consider a moment-based analogue obtained by replacing the absolute deviation with a squared residual. This L2 formulation is independent of rank transformations and, under a Gaussian assumption, recovers Pearson's coefficient of determination.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Generalized Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Laplace approximation (LA) and variational inference (VI) methods are popular approaches to Bayesian inference, each with trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy. However, a theoretical understanding of these differences is missing, particularly when both the sample size $n$ and the dimension $d$ are large. LA and Gaussian VI are justified by Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorems, and recent work has derived the characteristic condition $n\gg d^2$ for their validity, improving over the condition $n\gg d^3$. In this paper, we show for linear, logistic and Poisson regression that for $n\gtrsim d$, MCMC attains the same complexity scaling in $n$, $d$ as first-order optimization algorithms, up to sub-polynomial factors. Thus MCMC is competitive with LA and Gaussian VI in complexity, under a scaling between $n$ and $d$ more general than BvM regimes. Our complexities apply to appropriately scaled priors that are not necessarily Gaussian-tailed, including Student-$t$ and flat priors, with log-posteriors that are not necessarily globally concave or gradient-Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>Random matrix theory of sparse neuronal networks with heterogeneous timescales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectrum of the Laplacian on two models of random hyperbolic 3-orbifolds, related to the Apollonian group and the super Apollonian group. We determine explicit spectral gaps for these random orbifolds. Moreover, we use our model to investigate the bass note spectrum of the set of hyperbolic 3-orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation of Infinite Thermostat by Finite Reservoir Using the 3D Kac Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of $M$ particles interacting with a reservoir of $N$ particles, where $N &gt;&gt; M$, and compare this setup to one where the $M$-particle system interacts with a thermostat of infinite particles. Our goal is to prove a suitable upper bound, uniform in time, on the distance between the states of these two setups, given an initial Maxwellian state for both the reservoir and thermostat. Previous work has analyzed this problem using the one-dimensional Kac Model of gas collisions and an $L^2$ norm to define distance; the result was a bound which scaled with $M/\sqrt{N}$. In this paper, we use the $L^2$ norm and the three-dimensional generalization of the Kac Model to prove a bound whose long-term behavior scales with $M/N$.</description>

      <title>Fractional and Integer Order Sobolev Spaces for Compact Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact metric graph $\Gamma$ and the Laplacian $\Delta_{\Gamma}$ coupled with standard (Kirchhoff) vertex conditions, solutions to fractional elliptic partial differential equations of the form $(\kappa^2 - \Delta_{\Gamma})^{\alpha/2}u=f$ on $\Gamma$ exhibit a distinctive regularity structure: even-order derivatives are continuous across vertices, while odd-order derivatives may be discontinuous. This non-standard smoothness property precludes the direct application of classical tools from real functional analysis. Because of this, we introduce and systematically study new families of Sobolev spaces tailored to this setting. We define these spaces, denoted $W^{\alpha,p}(\Gamma)$ and $H^{\alpha}(\Gamma)$, to respect the continuity constraints on even-order derivatives at vertices, while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. We establish their fundamental properties, including characterizations, embedding theorems into H\"older and Lebesgue spaces, and compactness results. A central contribution in this investigation is the derivation of uniform bounds on the supremum norm of eigenfunctions for a class of Laplacians on metric graphs, a result of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs driven by Gaussian white noise on metric graphs, in particular, establishing a general characterization of the domain of the fractional powers of $(\kappa^2-\Delta_{\Gamma})$ and $(\kappa^2-\nabla(a\nabla))$ in terms of the Sobolev spaces we introduce, thereby extending all previously known characterizations in the literature, and improving the regularity results previously obtained to their sharp counterparts (with general fractional powers). We also show that these spaces are fundamental to the characterization of Gaussian free fields on metric graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategies for the growth of dual-seeded lattice structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal growth of structures governed by spatially stochastic dynamics arises in many scientific settings, for example in processes such as solution-based crystallization and the formation of microbial biofilms on patterned substrates or microfluidic networks. In this work, we investigate lattice growth using a two-dimensional, zero-temperature stochastic model of short-range spin interactions. Our goal is to determine how external perturbations can be optimized to steer the system efficiently toward the uniformly positive state, starting from two initial clusters of positive sites. To achieve this, we cast the problem as a Markov decision process adapted for a two-dimensional Ising model with zero-temperature dynamics. Within this framework, we compare alternative growth geometries and identify the structure of optimal strategies across three representative regimes.</description>

      <title>Recurrence to rare events for all points in countable Markov shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantitative recurrence to rare events in Countable Markov Shifts with recurrent potentials, focusing on return-time statistics to natural target sets for every point. In the positive recurrent case, return-time processes associated with non-periodic points converge to a standard Poisson process, while those for periodic points converge to a compound Poisson limit. In the null-recurrent regime, three distinct behaviors arise. Points satisfying certain combinatorial conditions (in particular, this class is generic in the measure-theoretic sense) exhibit fractional Poisson limits, whereas periodic points yield compound fractional Poisson limits. For all remaining points, we describe the full family of possible limit laws, each Pareto-dominated. This classification is sharp: every limit behavior in this family can be realized by an explicit system. For canonical families of null-recurrent CMS, we identify the limit process for every point, providing a complete description of return-time statistics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Disability insurance with collective health claims: A mean-field approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic semi-Markov disability model is expanded with individual and collective health claims to improve its explanatory and predictive power -- in particular in the context of group experience rating. The inclusion of collective health claims leads to a computationally challenging many-body problem. By adopting a mean-field approach, this many-body problem can be approximated by a non-linear one-body problem, which in turn leads to a transparent pricing method for disability coverages based on a lower-dimensional system of non-linear forward integro-differential equations. In a practice-oriented simulation study, the mean-field approximation clearly stands its ground in comparison to na\"ive Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Universality of high-dimensional scaling limits of stochastic gradient descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider statistical tasks in high dimensions whose loss depends on the data only through its projection into a fixed-dimensional subspace spanned by the parameter vectors and certain ground truth vectors. This includes classifying mixture distributions with cross-entropy loss with one and two-layer networks, and learning single and multi-index models with one and two-layer networks. When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this convergence occurs even when the data is drawn from mixtures of product measures provided the first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution and the initialization and ground truth vectors are sufficiently coordinate-delocalized. We complement this by proving two corresponding non-universality results. We provide a simple example where the ODE limits are non-universal if the initialization is coordinate aligned. We also show that the stochastic differential equation limits arising as fluctuations of the summary statistics around their ODE's fixed points are not universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}_n$ be the set of all mappings $T:[n]\to[n]$, where $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. The corresponding graph $G_T$ of $T$, called a functional digraph, is a union of disjoint connected components. Each component is a directed cycle of rooted labeled trees. We assume that each $T\in\mathcal{T}_n$ is chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathcal{T}_n$. The components and trees of $G_T$ are distinguished by their size. In this paper, we compute the limiting conditional probability ($n\to\infty$) that a vertex from the largest component of the random graph $G_T$, chosen uniformly at random from $[n]$, belongs to its $s$-th largest tree, where $s\ge 1$ is a fixed integer. This limit can be also viewed as an approximation of the probability that the $s$-th largest tree of $G_T$ is a subgraph of its largest component, which is a solution of a problem suggested by Mutafchiev and Finch (2024).</description>

      <title>Exponential Absolute Minimizing extension and biased infinity Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the variational structure of the biased infinity Laplacian by introducing a notion of the $\beta$\textit{-Exponential Absolute Minimizing Extension} ($\beta$--AM) on arbitrary length space, which absolutely minimizing the exponential slope
  $$ L^{\beta}_u (E) := \beta \sup_{x,y \in E} \frac{u(y) - e^{-\beta |x-y|} u(x)}{1- e^{-\beta |x-y|}}. $$We also define the corresponding Exponential McShane-Whitney-type extension, and $\beta$-biased convexity, which equivalently characterize $\beta$-AM and may be of independent interest. These generalize the classical Absolute Minimizing Lipschitz Extension as a special case when $\beta = 0$. In Euclidean space with Euclidean norm, this corresponds to the Aronsson equation with Hamiltonian \[ H(u, \nabla u) = |\nabla u| + \beta u, \] equivalently viscosity solutions of $\Delta_{\infty}^{\beta} u = 0$. We show that $\beta$-AM arises as the continuum value of a biased tug-of-war game. Analogous to the unbiased case, we derive various properties of this extension. As an application, we further show that the linear blow-up property holds for biased infinity harmonic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple inequality that compares the laws of two random variables taking values in a convex set of any normed vector space. By combining it with Arratia's coupling, recently refined by Koukoulopoulos and the author, we present a general strategy to reduce the problem of finding an asymptotic formula for the number of integers whose prime factorization falls into any given subset of $\ell^1(\mathbb R)$, to finding upper bounds for two key probabilities measuring proximity to the boundary of the subset in question.
  We apply this strategy to give an asymptotic formula for counting integers in $[1, x]$ that have a divisor in an interval $(y, z)$ with $z/y \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: We present examples of $p$-sub-exponential random variables for any positive $p$. We prove two types of concentration of standard $p$-norms ($2$-norm is the Euclidean norm) of random vectors with independent $p$-sub-exponential coordinates around the Lebesgue $L^p$-norms of these $p$-norms of random vectors. In the first case $p\ge 1$, our estimates depend on the dimension $n$ of random vectors. But in the second one for $p\ge 2$, with an additional assumption, we get an estimate that does not depend on $n$. In other words, we generalize some know concentration results in the Euclidean case to cases of the $p$-norms of random vectors with independent $p$-sub-exponential coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy landscape near the ground state of a model of a single particle in a random potential with trivial topology. More precisely, we find the large dimensional limit of the Hessian spectrum at the global minimum of the Hamiltonian $X_N(x) +\frac\mu2 \|x\|^2, x\in\mathbb{R}^N,$ when $\mu$ is above the phase transition threshold so that the system has only one critical point. Here $X_N$ is a locally isotropic Gaussian random field. The same idea is also applied to study the more general model of elastic manifold. In the replica symmetric regime, our results confirm the predictions of Fyodorov and Le Doussal made in 2018 and 2020 using the replica method.</description>

      <title>Loewner Theory for Bernstein functions II: applications to inhomogeneous continuous-state branching processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues the research project launched in [Constr. Approx. (2025) https://doi.org/10.1007/s00365-023-09675-9] and aimed at studying time-inhomogeneous one-dimensional branching processes (mainly on a continuous but also on a discrete state space) with the help of recent achievements in Loewner Theory dealing with evolution families of holomorphic self-maps in simply connected domains of the complex plane. Under a suitable stochastic continuity condition, we show that the families of the Laplace exponents of branching processes on$~[0,\infty]$ can be characterized as topological (i.e. depending continuously on the time parameters) reverse evolution families whose elements are Bernstein functions. For the case of a stronger regularity w.r.t. time, we establish a Loewner-Kufarev type ODE for the Laplace exponents and characterize branching processes with finite mean in terms of the vector field driving this ODE. Similar results are obtained for families of probability generating functions of branching processes on the discrete state space $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}\cup\{\infty\}$. In addition, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for "spatial" embeddability of such branching processes into branching processes on$~[0,\infty]$. Finally, we give some probabilistic interpretations of the Denjoy-Wolff point at$~0$ and at$~\infty$.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of the volume of loop O(n) quadrangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the volume of rigid loop-$O(n)$ quadrangulations with a boundary of length $2p$ in the non-generic critical regime. We prove that, as the half-perimeter $p$ goes to infinity, the volume scales in distribution to an explicit random variable. This limiting random variable is described in terms of the multiplicative cascades of Chen, Curien and Maillard arXiv:1702.06916, or alternatively (in the dilute case) as the law of the area of a unit-boundary $\gamma$-quantum disc, as determined by Ang and Gwynne arXiv:1903.09120, for suitable $\gamma$. Our arguments go through a classification of the map into several regions, where we rule out the contribution of bad regions to be left with a tractable portion of the map. One key observable for this classification is a Markov chain which explores the nested loops around a size-biased vertex pick in the map, making explicit the spinal structure of the discrete multiplicative cascade. We stress that our techniques enable us to include the boundary case $n=2$, that we define rigorously, and where the nested cascade structure is that of a critical branching random walk. In that case the scaling limit is given by the limit of the derivative martingale and is inverse-exponentially distributed, which answers a conjecture of arXiv:2005.06372v2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00081v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an imprecise Markov semigroup $\mathbf{Q}$. It is a tool that allows us to represent ambiguity around both the initial and the transition probabilities of a continuous-time Markov process via a compact collection of Markov semigroups, each associated with a (possibly different) Markov process. We use techniques from topology, geometry, and probability to study the ergodic behavior of $\mathbf{Q}$. We show that, under some conditions that also involve the geometry of the state space, eventually the ambiguity fades. We call this property ergodicity of the imprecise Markov semigroup, and we relate it to the classical notion of ergodicity. We prove ergodicity both when the state space is Euclidean or a Riemannian manifold, and when it is an arbitrary measurable space. The importance of our findings for the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision is also discussed, in particular in the study of how the probability of an output evolves over time as we perturb the input of a convolutional autoencoder.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar equation: Global solution and invariant measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation perturbed by both additive and multiplicative noises is a system of fourth order stochastic PDEs which models the evolution of magnetic spin fields in ferromagnetic materials at elevated temperatures, taking into account longitudinal damping, long-range interactions, spin current, and noise-induced phenomena at high temperatures. In this paper, we show the existence of a unique pathwise solution (which is analytically strong) to the stochastic LLBar equation posed in a bounded domain $\mathscr{D}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=1,2,3$. We also prove the convergence of this pathwise solution to that of the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation in the limit of vanishing exchange relaxation parameter. Finally, we show the Feller property of the Markov semigroup associated with the strong solution, and prove the existence of nontrivial invariant measures. For temperatures above the Curie temperature, exponential stability of the solution and uniqueness of invariant measure are obtained under certain dissipativity conditions.</description>

Abstract: We consider Betti numbers of the excursion of a smooth Euclidean Gaussian field restricted to a rectangular window, in the asymptotics where the window grows to R^d . With motivations coming from Topological Data Analysis, we derive a functional Central Limit Theorem where the varying argument is the thresholding parameter, under assumptions of regularity and covariance decay for the field and its derivatives. We also show fixed-level CLTs coming from martingale based techniques inspired from the theory of geometric stabilisation, and limiting non-degenerate variance.</description>

      <title>On domination for (non-symmetric) Dirichlet forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary aim of this article is to investigate the domination relationship between two $L^2$-semigroups using probabilistic methods. According to Ouhabaz's domination criterion, the domination of semigroups can be transformed into relationships involving the corresponding Dirichlet forms. Our principal result establishes the equivalence between the domination of Dirichlet forms and the killing transformation of the associated Markov processes, which generalizes and completes the results in \cite{Y962} and \cite{Y96}. Based on this equivalence, we provide a representation of the dominated Dirichlet form using the bivariate Revuz measure associated with the killing transformation and further characterize the sandwiched Dirichlet form within the broader Dirichlet form framework. In particular, our findings apply to the characterization of operators sandwiched between the Dirichlet Laplacian and the Neumann Laplacian. For the local boundary case, we eliminate all technical conditions identified in the literature \cite{AW03} and deliver a complete representation of all sandwiched operators governed by a Robin boundary condition determined by a specific quasi-admissible measure. Additionally, our results offer a comprehensive characterization of related operators in the non-local Robin boundary case, specifically resolving an open problem posed in the literature \cite{OA21}.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ random matrix, where each entry is an i.i.d.sub-exponential random variable with mean 0 and variance $\frac{1}{m^2}$. We demonstrate that, with high probability, the sub-exponential matrix $A$ can be used for the exact reconstruction of $s$-sparse vectors via $\ell_1$-minimization, provided that $m \ge C_1 s \log\left(\frac{C_2 n}{s}\right)$. This improves upon the existing results by Adamczak et al.</description>

      <title>Contact process with viral load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present two novel variants of the contact process. In the first variant individuals carry a viral load. An individual with viral load zero is classified as healthy and otherwise infected. If an individual becomes infected it begins with a viral load of one, which then evolves according to a Birth-Death process. In this model, viral load indicates severity of the infection such that individuals with a higher load can be more infectious. Moreover, the recovery times of individual is not necessarily exponentially distributed and can even be chosen to follow a power-law distribution. In the second variant individuals are permanently infected albeit in two states: actively infected or dormant. The dynamics of these individual states are again governed by a Birth-Death process. Dormant infections do not interact with neighbouring individuals but may reactivate spontaneously. Active infections reactivate dormant neighbours at a constant rate and may become dormant themselves.
  We present for both variants a Poisson construction. For the first model, we study the phase transition of survival and discuss existence of a non-trivial upper invariant law. Additionally, we derive a duality relationship between the two variant, which we use to uncover a phase transition regarding invariant distributions in the second variant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $L^1$ transport-entropy inequality (or $T_1$ inequality), which bounds the $1$-Wasserstein distance in terms of the relative entropy, is known to characterize Gaussian concentration. To extend the $T_1$ inequality to laws of discrete-time processes while preserving their temporal structure, we investigate the adapted $T_1$ inequality which relates the $1$-adapted Wasserstein distance to the relative entropy. Building on the Bolley--Villani inequality, we establish the adapted $T_1$ inequality under the same moment assumption as the classical $T_1$ inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the metastable behavior of diffusion processes in narrow tube domains, where the metastability is induced by entropic barriers. We identify a sequence of characteristic time scales $\{T_\epsilon^i\}_{1 \leq i \leq \abs{V'}}$ and characterize the asymptotic behavior of the diffusion process both at intermediate time scales and at the first critical time scale. Our analysis relies on a refined understanding of the narrow escape problem in domains with bottlenecks, in particular on estimates for the exit place and on the conditional distribution of the exit time given the exit place, results that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the global well-posedness of hyperbolic SPDEs on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, driven by a space-time L\'evy white noise, when the drift and diffusion coefficients are locally Lipschitz and have linear growth. The equations are driven by two types of space-time L\'evy noise: (i) a finite-variance L\'evy white noise; or (ii) a symmetric L\'evy basis that may have infinite variance. A typical example of noise of the second type is the symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) random measure with $\alpha \in (0,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for the maxima of norms of martingale sequences in smooth Banach spaces which allow for a finite number of higher conditional moments. The bound is obtained by combining an optimization approach for a Chernoff bound due to Rio (2017) with a classical bound for moment generating functions of smooth Banach space norms by Pinelis (1994). Our result improves comparable infinite-dimensional bounds in the literature by removing unnecessary centering terms and giving precise constants. As an application, we propose a McDiarmid-type bound for vector-valued functions which allow for a uniform bound on their conditional higher moments.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Approximation Factor in Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.05876v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the following problem: given two arbitrary densities $q_1,q_2$ and a sample-access to an unknown target density $p$, find which of the $q_i$'s is closer to $p$ in total variation.
  A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $p$ and outputs~$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p) \leq 3\cdot\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$, where $\mathsf{opt}= \min\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class of densities $\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best density in $\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3.
  We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from $\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary densities (e.g.\ a mixture of densities from $\mathcal{Q}$), then the approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup.
  We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of 2: an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the total variation. Our sample complexity bounds exploit techniques from {\it Adaptive Data Analysis}.</description>

      <title>On $\beta=6$ Tracy-Widom distribution and the second Calogero-Painlev\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.06733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Calogero-Painlev\'e systems were introduced in 2001 by K. Takasaki as a natural generalization of the classical Painlev\'e equations to the case of the several Painlev\'e ``particles'' coupled via the Calogero type interactions. In 2014, I. Rumanov discovered the remarkable fact that a particular case of the second Calogero-Painlev\'e II equation describes the Tracy-Widom distribution function for the general beta-ensembles with even values of the parameter beta. Most recently, in 2017 work of M. Bertola, M. Cafasso, and V. Rubtsov, it was proven that all Calogero-Painlev\'e systems are Lax integrable, and hence their solutions admit a Riemann-Hilbert representation. This important observation has opened the door to rigorous, based on the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method, asymptotic analysis of the Calogero-Painlev\'e equations. This in turn yields the possibility of rigorous evaluation of the asymptotic behavior of the Tracy-Widom distributions for the values of beta beyond the classical $\beta =1, 2, 4.$ In this work we shall start an asymptotic analysis of the Calogero-Painlev\'e system with a special focus on the Calogero-Painlev\'e system corresponding to $\beta = 6$ Tracy-Widom distribution function. The principle technical challenge is the implementation of the nonlinear steepest descent approach beyond the $2\times 2$ matrix dimension of the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem; in our case, it is $6\times 6$.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow on control space with rough initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the (sub-Riemannian type) control problem of finding a path going from an initial point $x$ to a target point $y$, by only moving in certain admissible directions. We assume that the corresponding vector fields satisfy the bracket-generating (H\"ormander) condition, so that the classical Chow-Rashevskii theorem guarantees the existence of such a path. One natural way to try to solve this problem is via a gradient flow on control space. However, since the corresponding dynamics may have saddle points, any convergence result must rely on suitable (e.g. random) initialisation. We consider the case when this initialisation is irregular, which is conveniently formulated via Lyons' rough path theory. We show that one advantage of this initialisation is that the saddle points are moved to infinity, while minima remain at a finite distance from the starting point. In the step $2$-nilpotent case, we further manage to prove that the gradient flow converges to a solution, if the initial condition is the path of a Brownian motion (or rougher). The proof is based on combining ideas from Malliavin calculus with {\L}ojasiewicz inequalities. A possible motivation for our study comes from the training of deep Residual Neural Nets, in the regime when the number of trainable parameters per layer is smaller than the dimension of the data vector.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) serve as mathematical models for the time evolutions of random systems with memory effects and irregular behaviour. We introduce neural stochastic Volterra equations as a physics-inspired architecture, generalizing the class of neural stochastic differential equations, and provide some theoretical foundation. Numerical experiments on various SVEs, like the disturbed pendulum equation, the generalized Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, the rough Heston model and a monetary reserve dynamics, are presented, comparing the performance of neural SVEs, neural SDEs and Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets).</description>

      <title>Random Reshuffling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control for Systems with Drifts of Bounded Variation: A Maximum Principle Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic control problem for nonlinear systems governed by
  stochastic differential equations with irregular drift. The drift
  coefficient is assumed to decompose as $b(t,x,a)=b_1(t,x)+b_2(x)b_3(t,a)$, where $b_1$ is bounded and Borel
  measurable, $b_2$ has bounded variation, and $b_3$ is bounded and
  smooth.
  Under these minimal regularity assumptions, we establish a
  Pontryagin-type stochastic maximum principle. The analysis relies on
  new results for SDEs with random drift of bounded variation, including
  existence, uniqueness, and Malliavin-Sobolev differentiability of the
  state process. A key ingredient is an explicit representation of the
  first variation process obtained via integration with respect to the
  space-time local time of bounded variation processes. By combining a
  suitable approximation scheme with Ekeland's variational principle, and
  using a Garcia-Rodemich-Rumsey inequality to obtain a uniform control
  of the first variation, we derive the maximum principle. As an application, we derive an optimal corridor-type capital adjustment policy for an insurance surplus model.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions for a class of stochastic thermo-magneto-hydrodynamic-type systems with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, in both the PDE and probabilistic sense, for a broad class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on a bounded domain $\mathscr{O}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=2,3$), driven by multiplicative Gaussian noise. The solutions are global in time for $d=2$. This theory simultaneously covers several physically relevant systems, including stochastic convective Brinkman--Forchheimer equations, stochastic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), stochastic B\'enard convection in porous media, stochastic convective dynamo system, stochastic thermo-magneto-micropolar fluids, and stochastic diffusive tropical climate model, for which previous results only provide analytically weak martingale or pathwise solutions. The proof relies on Galerkin approximation and compactness argument. Up to a suitable stopping time, we derive strong moment bounds and verify a Cauchy property for the approximate solutions, in the absence of any inherent cancellation structure. By applying a Gronwall-type lemma for stochastic processes, we establish the existence and uniqueness of maximal strong pathwise solutions, which are global in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Approximating the coefficients of the Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for the Landau equation via microcanonical binary collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully constructive, conservative, and collision-level realization of Kac's program for the spatially homogeneous Landau equation across the full interaction range, including the Coulomb case. Our model is the microcanonical binary-collision (MBC) process: a reversible pure-jump $N$-particle Markov process that is Landau-native, realizing the grazing-collision mechanism via small conservative rotations of relative velocities. The analysis hinges on two critical structural pillars: a Fisher-information dissipation mechanism that extends the Guill\'en--Silvestre paradigm (Acta Math. 234:315-375, 2025) to a genuinely conservative particle system, yielding robust control of singular configurations, and a quantitative self-averaging principle that enforces a coherent deterministic emergence of the Landau flow from the microscopic dynamics. We prove propagation of chaos in the joint mean-field and grazing-collision limit ($N\to\infty, h\to 0$), identifying any limit point with the unique global solution to the Landau equation. Furthermore, we rigorously derive the Landau master equation as the grazing-collision limit of the MBC process. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first fully conservative, Landau-native binary-collision model rigorously shown to produce the Landau equation over the entire interaction range.</description>
